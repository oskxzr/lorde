01:45.105 --> 01:47.315
We are so glad
you spent your morning with us.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.189
And congratulations on your first week.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.129
- Yeah. Well done. Good job.
- Happy Friday, everyone.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.823
Thank you, guys. It's been a fun ride.

[CREW CHATTERS]

02:25.145 --> 02:27.265
[SIGHS] Okay. All right.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.609
Let me explain something to you
real quick.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.822
The business of this show
is a complicated world. Okay?

02:33.904 --> 02:35.494
There are rules we have to honor here.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.259
You may think you don't have to,
but you would be fucking wrong. Okay?

02:38.283 --> 02:40.163
This show, it will consume you,

02:40.244 --> 02:42.754
it will spit out
your bones and some gristle

02:42.829 --> 02:44.869
and your fucking spirit along with it.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.268
Unless that's what you're trying to
accomplish, in which case,

02:47.292 --> 02:48.752
I don't know what to tell you.

02:49.211 --> 02:52.551
- Chip, what are you trying to say?
- You could do great work here.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.801
Don't annihilate yourself in the process

02:54.883 --> 02:57.683
just for the sake of pushing buttons
that you aren't supposed to push.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.757
Be careful.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.467
Why? 'Cause if the network's found
culpable, you're the fall guy?

- [CHIP SCOFFS]
- It'll kill your career?

03:04.184 --> 03:07.524
Unfortunately, I think
that death ship is sailing as we speak.

Look, not everybody's
a self-serving pile of shit.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.400

- Not now, Rena. I need five seconds...

- Uh, she's good, Mitch.
- Remember, crate training.

You have to crate train. Hey.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.857
Um, why are you here?

03:50.397 --> 03:51.687
I worked here for 15 years.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.773
There's something
I wanna say to these good people.

03:54.026 --> 03:57.236
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- I think it's a great idea.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.217
- Okay, call security.
- I already did.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.041
I'm staying with you.
I mean, I wanna see the show.

04:04.453 --> 04:07.793

a sawed-off shotgun under his coat.

[CHUCKLES]

04:15.422 --> 04:16.422
[MITCH] Hi.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.505
You know,

04:21.595 --> 04:24.885
I noticed on the way in that
there aren't any pictures of me out there.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.313
What's going on with that?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.891
Who did that? Who did that?

04:29.436 --> 04:30.556
[LAUGHS] I'm kidding.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.903
Well...

04:34.816 --> 04:36.146
isn't this awkward?

04:37.194 --> 04:38.364
[CHUCKLES]

04:38.445 --> 04:41.695
I know you're terrified to say anything,
so I'll do all the talking.

[EXHALES]

04:45.369 --> 04:46.749
This is so weird.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.829
[SIGHS] First of all, I'm sorry.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.128
And when I say that,
I'm not admitting guilt or anything.

04:54.211 --> 04:58.131
I am sorry in the same way you might be
sorry for someone who was hit by a bus,

04:59.049 --> 05:00.799
even though you weren't driving the bus.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.511
So, I'm sorry that the show
got hit by a bus.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.060
We all got hit.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.067

[SIGHS]

05:28.370 --> 05:29.540
Hey, Alex.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.957
I heard that you did an interview
with one of my alleged victims,

05:38.714 --> 05:41.234
and that there's a New York Times article
coming out imminently.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.760
And we all know how that's gonna go.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.766
I'm sure they're not
gonna do a feel-good piece about me.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.729
So that's the other reason I'm here.

05:52.728 --> 05:56.648
I am asking you to speak up on my behalf.

05:57.316 --> 06:01.776
Call the Times, go on record,
give 'em quotes.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.276
You guys know me better than anybody, so,

06:05.866 --> 06:06.946
out there,

06:08.327 --> 06:09.907
they're gonna blow this up.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.579
But you've worked with me.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.544
We have worked side by side
for years and years.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.916
We have shared family experiences.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.303
We are colleagues. We're friends.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.680
I'm asking you all, as friends,

06:24.092 --> 06:25.972
to speak out on my behalf.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.653
Mitch, this is not okay.
You need to leave.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.902
I know that some of you want to do it.

06:40.984 --> 06:44.284
I know that there are some of you
who want to speak up.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.113
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.988
This is scary. I get it.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.365
Going against the grain,

06:49.451 --> 06:51.621
saying things that are unpopular
in the moment

06:51.703 --> 06:54.213
about people that are unpopular
in the moment.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.581
But this is my fucking life!

07:00.504 --> 07:01.764
Who will speak up for me?

07:03.090 --> 07:05.880
Who here will speak up for me?

07:12.057 --> 07:15.847
You are the people
that I love in the world!

07:27.948 --> 07:28.948
No?

08:06.278 --> 08:07.398
I understand.

08:08.614 --> 08:12.584
But from the bottom of my heart,
I just want you all to know...

08:14.369 --> 08:16.079
how important you are to me.

wants to put my head on a spike.

No. No, no, no. A lot of us
actually find you incredibly inspiring.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.563

I really appreciate it.

some of us from the office tomorrow night?

10:01.935 --> 10:05.185
It's Claire's birthday,
and we're going drinking.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.901
It's your birthday.

I'm sure you have
something much better to do.

10:09.902 --> 10:12.032
No. I actually have nothing to do.
I don't...

10:12.112 --> 10:14.622
I don't really know anybody here.
So I would love to come.

10:14.698 --> 10:17.698

He stole my self-confidence,

- Yeah, I know, Mia.

No, no. I'm not gonna say
what you think I'm gonna say.

I thought it was a great interview.
I'm really proud of it,

13:52.124 --> 13:53.754
especially with Mitch showing up after.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.634

that what you did was right.

is gonna be curious, right?

14:09.850 --> 14:11.640

- and with Ashley's confession...
- [SIGHS]

14:13.687 --> 14:16.457
It's just opened up the door
to more questions about The Morning Show.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.901
And she is gonna expect you
to answer them.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.446
What are you asking?

14:24.323 --> 14:26.623
I'm just asking
that you keep all that in mind.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.290
Maggie thinks she's smarter than everyone.

14:33.457 --> 14:36.127
[BRADLEY] Well, I have no idea why
The Morning Show chose me.

14:36.210 --> 14:39.800
I mean, I feel like sometimes
they got the wrong person or something.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.430
Like, someone's gonna call up
and tell me it was a big mistake.

the self-effacing authenticity.

- Now, how do you hold on to all that?
- Oh, I...

14:52.100 --> 14:57.060
I mean, I don't know. I guess,
just don't believe your own press.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.317
Don't surround yourself with yes-people.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.856
Mainly I just think
we're all gonna end up dead,

15:01.944 --> 15:03.864
so there's no coming out on top anyway.

But... Alex.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.559
I've known her for a long time.
She is a legend.

15:33.642 --> 15:34.642
She is.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.186
Do you think that she's up for this...

15:38.021 --> 15:41.191
Morning Show feminist revolution
that you've ignited?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.569
Especially in her own home.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.568
Oh, I think she is.

15:47.155 --> 15:51.365
But do you notice a shift
in the behind-the-scenes culture

15:51.827 --> 15:53.117
now that Mitch is gone?

15:53.620 --> 15:57.170
Or is that even possible given
that so much of the old guard remains?

15:57.583 --> 15:59.811
I wasn't there before,
so I can't really speak to a shift.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.125
But you were clearly
chasing that story yesterday

16:02.212 --> 16:03.842
in your interview with Ashley Brown,

16:03.922 --> 16:06.302
wondering at the culture

16:06.383 --> 16:09.763
that allowed Mitch's behavior
to go unchecked for a decade.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.845
So I think it's fair to assume
you're curious?

16:20.522 --> 16:23.362
Yeah, I'm human. And I'm a journalist.

16:23.442 --> 16:26.242
So when I see someone
who has a story to tell,

16:26.320 --> 16:28.910
I try to create space
for them to share it.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.869

There were four accusers who came forward,

17:12.406 --> 17:15.656

we now have two more women

let Fred give you a quote

Four sources of quotes.

18:12.843 --> 18:15.263
Three are women who work
or have worked on the show,

18:15.345 --> 18:17.965
one from a male
who currently works on the show.

18:18.056 --> 18:21.596
These events took place
in his dressing room, in his car,

It's some direct quotes

One of them is Fred's old assistant,
Janine Friedman.

[DICK] What's the quote from Friedman?

18:58.805 --> 19:02.845
Janine stated, "There was always an
environment of protection for the stars."

19:02.935 --> 19:05.265
I'm not speaking
directly about sexual allegations,

19:05.354 --> 19:09.484
but obviously the stars are the bread and
butter, and they are fiercely protected.

What do you have for a social obligation
I'm not emotionally equipped to be at?

29:37.736 --> 29:40.566
Ah, Jameson.
It got us through the social obligation

29:40.656 --> 29:42.336
of lying to the British for quite a while.

29:42.741 --> 29:45.331
Perfect. I'll have that on the rocks.

29:45.410 --> 29:46.830
Actually, make it a double.

29:46.912 --> 29:50.082
A double? I'll run a tab for ya.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.333
Great. My name's Bradley.

29:52.751 --> 29:53.791
I'll remember ya.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.094
All right. Wish me luck.

Good luck.

30:04.847 --> 30:06.387
Oh, yeah, Claire and I invited her.

30:06.473 --> 30:09.143
She actually showed up? Interesting.

30:09.226 --> 30:11.496
- Oh, my God. I love that hair.
- Who wants another round?

30:11.520 --> 30:14.900
You like it? The network made me
look like a tool. So, I changed it.

30:14.982 --> 30:17.072
Anyway, thank you for having me.

30:17.150 --> 30:18.150
Happy birthday, Claire.

30:18.235 --> 30:19.695
- This is for you.
- Oh, thank you.

30:19.778 --> 30:21.778
- To Claire. To Claire.
- Oh, thank you.

30:21.864 --> 30:23.954
- To Claire.
- Thank you very much.

- Cheers.

30:32.875 --> 30:35.585
- Tequila.
- [BRADLEY] Tequila.

30:35.669 --> 30:37.959
Yes, tequila.
And then we're gonna put it on my card,

- Ms. Jackson if you're nasty.

You nasty, Layla. I see you.

30:50.934 --> 30:53.734
How does he know who I am?
This is so weird.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.022
- Oh, get used to it.
- That's what this is for.

you don't like thinking about.

Well, I'm no Neil Diamond, but I do okay.

31:41.818 --> 31:44.568
No, the singing was great,

What I was getting at was

32:02.965 --> 32:05.255
there is something
that I would like to discuss with you.

32:05.342 --> 32:06.342
Okay.

32:07.135 --> 32:11.675
Preferably not in an environment
that is teeming with TMS overlords.

32:11.765 --> 32:14.975

TMS has been my home for a long time,

32:15.060 --> 32:18.360
and I don't think
my work here is done just yet.

32:18.814 --> 32:20.324
Do you feel appreciated?

32:20.858 --> 32:22.068
I feel motivated.

32:22.943 --> 32:25.993
Okay, keep telling yourself that.
Come talk to me.

32:31.493 --> 32:35.623
Hey. Why don't you be a good gay and
come listen to show tunes with me, huh?

32:36.164 --> 32:38.044
- Sure.
- Okay, come on.

32:38.792 --> 32:39.936

- [ALEX] Brutally painful.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.396
[YANKO]
Oh, no. There's nothing much left now.

32:41.420 --> 32:42.981
- All right. So, are you gonna sing?

- Please, make him sing.
- Oh, please. Come on.

32:45.174 --> 32:48.014
I'm thinking "Modern Major General"
'cause I can talk-sing it,

32:48.093 --> 32:49.529

that Rex Harrison ever sang in. We'll see.

33:13.702 --> 33:17.082
I know that you already had a full day
with my new partner in crime.

33:17.164 --> 33:18.504
She's quite something, huh?

33:18.916 --> 33:20.376
Bradley, yeah.

33:20.459 --> 33:24.049
- Yeah, she's an interesting find.
- Yes, I know. I know.

33:25.464 --> 33:27.764
- Is she here?
- Mm-mm.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.131
- Okay.
- Nope, she's not here.

33:29.218 --> 33:31.758
No, she actually
is taking a night for herself.

- Which she has earned.
- Oh, well, good for her.

33:34.765 --> 33:37.845
It must've been quite the week
being shot outta the TMS cannon.

33:37.935 --> 33:39.095
It was a tough week for her.

33:39.561 --> 33:44.401
And, I mean, she's extremely talented,
but she got quite shell-shocked

33:44.483 --> 33:46.403
when I told her
that she had to go on air Monday.

33:46.485 --> 33:47.945
Who wouldn't be? So...

33:49.780 --> 33:51.450
You made the Monday call?

33:51.949 --> 33:53.779
Yeah, I know what the show needs.

33:53.867 --> 33:56.247
You know, a fast, fresh start.

33:56.328 --> 34:00.118
Feminist slant. And it couldn't
happen faster in my opinion.

34:00.791 --> 34:03.211
And Bradley came through like a superstar.

34:03.293 --> 34:07.713
I mean, for someone who has
zero anchor experience, she did great.

34:07.798 --> 34:12.138
[LAUGHS] Well, clearly guided
by the steady hand of someone

34:12.219 --> 34:14.500
who has been through the wringers
of the industry herself.

34:14.554 --> 34:18.314
Well, yes. I mean, you know this, Maggie.

34:18.391 --> 34:21.401
It's never straightforward
when women try to take control

34:21.478 --> 34:24.518
of a male-dominated empire, you know?

34:24.606 --> 34:26.776
But we made history with that interview.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.030
You're already a royal we? That's cute.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.112
Thank you.

34:32.864 --> 34:36.874
I mean, come on, you really think
that I wouldn't take a firm hand

34:36.952 --> 34:39.662
in an interview that had stakes that high?

34:40.414 --> 34:43.384
I mean, I worked with Bradley all week,
I guided her,

34:44.126 --> 34:46.916
trying to get to the truth
of Ashley's experience.

34:47.629 --> 34:52.469
And it was intense. And it was tough.
But we, I... We got there.

34:54.011 --> 34:56.261
Is this supposed to be on the record?

34:59.725 --> 35:00.725
No.

that you would be interested

over at TMS.

sitting next to Mitch.

to make things better over there

- Alex, we've known each other too long.

I have tremendous respect for you, but...

35:29.922 --> 35:33.932
I am not going to write
some feminist puff piece

35:34.009 --> 35:35.299
about a woman...

35:36.845 --> 35:40.515
who turned a blind eye
to the sexual misconduct of her cohost.

Excuse me?

35:45.729 --> 35:48.519
Bradley's profile is gonna be great.

35:51.276 --> 35:53.946
I don't blame you
for being worried about getting lost,

35:54.029 --> 35:58.029
the fear that someone sitting next to you
is your replacement.

35:59.993 --> 36:02.043
I know this is really hard for you.

36:04.414 --> 36:06.124
Would you like to comment on that?

36:10.295 --> 36:12.045
Off the record, Maggie.

appreciate being left off the Times call.

56:18.462 --> 56:20.922
I'm just... I'm calling you because...

56:23.509 --> 56:28.099
because I was thinking of you.
I'm always thinking of you.

56:29.973 --> 56:32.103
And I've been watching your program.

56:32.976 --> 56:36.186
And maybe it's selfish of me,
but I wanted to call,

56:37.147 --> 56:39.357
and I wanted to tell you how proud,

56:40.817 --> 56:42.317
how very...

56:45.072 --> 56:49.082
How proud, how very proud I am.

56:49.159 --> 56:51.079
I wish your grandmother could see you.

56:54.206 --> 56:59.126
I always knew that you were so smart,
Bradley.

57:01.046 --> 57:02.046
The way you would...

57:03.340 --> 57:06.640
you would debate politics with me
when you were little.

57:07.511 --> 57:09.181
It's not that I'm...

57:09.263 --> 57:14.733
I'm taking credit for
how extraordinary you turned out to be.

57:16.311 --> 57:18.271
No, quite the opposite.

57:19.690 --> 57:25.570
No. Considering where you came from
and how far you've come...

57:28.532 --> 57:30.452
I put you through hell.

57:35.706 --> 57:37.116
Are you still there?

57:41.420 --> 57:43.260
I put you through some hell, too.

57:44.631 --> 57:45.631
Mm-mmm.

57:45.716 --> 57:47.756
You did what you thought you had to do.

57:52.222 --> 57:53.772
I did what I had to do.

57:55.225 --> 57:56.725
Look, you can't call me.

57:57.769 --> 58:00.609
You didn't call Mom, did you?
'Cause you know she's pretty fragile.

58:02.566 --> 58:04.526
No, I've not called her, I'm...

58:05.569 --> 58:07.199
I don't wanna make any trouble.

58:07.279 --> 58:09.199
Well, then don't, okay? I got to go.

58:09.281 --> 58:11.241
Okay. Good night.

58:12.534 --> 58:13.994
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

58:17.164 --> 58:18.424
I always have.

58:42.314 --> 58:45.534
- Hey.
- Hey. Uh, can I get a drink?

58:48.195 --> 58:49.655
It's on the house.

58:54.451 --> 58:56.701
- One more?
- Yeah. Just keep it coming.

58:56.787 --> 58:58.247
- All right.
- What's your name?

58:58.330 --> 59:00.040
- Oh, it's Andrew.
- Andrew.

59:00.123 --> 59:02.293
- Yeah. What's your name?
- I'm Bradley.

59:02.376 --> 59:03.853
- Actually, I've run your card...
- Oh, yeah?

59:03.877 --> 59:06.257
- Which I still have, by the way.
- [LAUGHS]

59:21.895 --> 59:23.395
[BRADLEY MOANS]

59:27.234 --> 59:28.994
Okay. All right.

59:31.989 --> 59:33.869
- [EXHALES] I got to go.
- You got to what?

59:33.949 --> 59:36.869
- Yeah.
- You got to be kidding me.

59:47.337 --> 59:50.087
That... fucking asshole.

59:58.182 --> 01:00:00.522
I... I really... I need to go home.

01:00:00.601 --> 01:00:03.101
Come on, Alex.
You knew all about this stuff.

01:00:03.187 --> 01:00:05.227
I knew it, yeah.

01:00:06.732 --> 01:00:10.192
I knew about it in theory,
but just reading this

01:00:10.277 --> 01:00:12.357
just felt really, really different.

01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:14.486
- Can you just please...
- Okay. Okay.

01:00:14.573 --> 01:00:16.583
I need to go home, Mitch. Please.

01:00:17.075 --> 01:00:18.485
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:00:23.749 --> 01:00:24.749
Okay.

01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:26.167
[SIGHS]

01:01:08.669 --> 01:01:10.522
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson.
I can't give you his room number.

01:01:10.546 --> 01:01:12.706
Yes, you can. I live here. He lives here.

01:01:12.798 --> 01:01:14.567
He's my neighbor.
I have a right to know his address.

01:01:14.591 --> 01:01:17.511
No one is disputing he stays here.
I just can't give you his room number.

01:01:17.594 --> 01:01:19.572
Then just call him
and tell him that I'm down here.

01:01:19.596 --> 01:01:21.366
I'm not gonna call
'cause I know he's not up there.

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:22.930
- Why do you keep saying...
- Bradley.

01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:25.346
- So sorry I'm late.
- Cory.

01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:28.435
I told him I knew you,
but he wasn't listening.

01:01:28.522 --> 01:01:30.482
Yeah, my apologies.
Come with me, all right?

01:01:30.566 --> 01:01:31.726
- So rude.
- It's okay.

01:01:31.817 --> 01:01:34.237
Don't worry about that guy.
He's just doing...

01:01:34.319 --> 01:01:35.779
[BRADLEY] I'm glad I found you.

01:01:35.863 --> 01:01:39.243
I'm hearing, from that conversation,
that you're living here now, huh?

01:01:39.324 --> 01:01:42.494
- Yeah. They moved me here.
- All right. What room are you in?

01:01:42.578 --> 01:01:44.748
- I live upstairs.
- Oh.

01:01:45.706 --> 01:01:46.746
Okay.

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.134
You wanna tell me what happened?

01:01:50.586 --> 01:01:52.206
- No. I don't know.
- All right.

01:01:52.296 --> 01:01:55.966
I do know. I did something
really fucking stupid.

01:01:56.049 --> 01:01:57.629
It's okay. Here. Hold on.

01:01:57.718 --> 01:02:01.808
- [SIGHS] I fucked this bartender.
- Okay, well...

01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:03.769
And I'm not sorry that I fucked him.

01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:06.389
I'm just worried because,

01:02:06.476 --> 01:02:08.556
I don't know,
I guess I'm famous now or something,

01:02:08.645 --> 01:02:09.855
I don't know.

01:02:09.938 --> 01:02:13.648
I'm so...
I just don't know what I'm doing.

01:02:13.734 --> 01:02:16.364
No, no. Hey. Hey. It's okay. Come here.

01:02:16.445 --> 01:02:17.445
Lean on me.

01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:19.738
It's all right. I gotcha.

01:02:20.616 --> 01:02:23.736
- Don't you worry, okay?
- I'm just embarrassed.

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:27.367
Don't be. I got you. It's gonna be okay.

01:02:39.718 --> 01:02:41.468
[PHONE LINE RINGING]

01:02:48.685 --> 01:02:51.145
- Yes?
- Hey, yeah, Fred. It's Mitch.

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.230
"Fred Micklen told the Times,"

01:02:53.315 --> 01:02:56.025
'He came to the studio
in an emotional state.

01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:57.569
He had to be escorted out.

01:02:57.653 --> 01:03:01.323
It's painful to watch,
but his own actions brought him to this.

01:03:01.406 --> 01:03:03.986
"He's done. He'll never work again.'"

01:03:06.912 --> 01:03:09.922
If I'm going down,
you are going down with me.

01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:12.713
[CALL ENDS, BEEPS]

01:03:14.002 --> 01:03:17.712
You are going down, motherfucker.
