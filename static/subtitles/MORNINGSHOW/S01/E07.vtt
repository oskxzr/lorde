It's David Attenborough.

04:21.934 --> 04:24.788
Anyway, there's this category of animals,
they're called ambush predators.

04:24.812 --> 04:26.647
And they run the gamut between starfish,

04:26.730 --> 04:30.609
cephalopods, crustaceans,
spiders, snakes, cats even.

04:30.693 --> 04:34.280
And ambush predators,
they wait for the prey

04:34.363 --> 04:37.032
to come within ambush distance
before striking.

04:37.116 --> 04:39.326
They're deliberate.
They usually remain hidden,

04:39.410 --> 04:41.912
in camouflage right up
until the moment they strike.

04:41.996 --> 04:44.623
But when they do strike,
it's over before it began.

04:44.707 --> 04:48.711

It's a different strategy.

04:48.794 --> 04:50.296
Direct. Aggressive.

I mean, let's face it,

25:26.323 --> 25:31.662
I was slow to tailor

25:39.920 --> 25:41.881
you hand her the ball
beyond the three-point line

25:41.964 --> 25:43.483
and you just give her the green light.

25:43.507 --> 25:45.402
And now's really the fun part
where we get to sit back

25:45.426 --> 25:48.345
and really, you know,
watch her do what she does.

25:48.429 --> 25:52.099
Okay. Great. That should do it.

25:54.351 --> 25:56.896
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm. That's it.

25:57.313 --> 25:59.190
With that basketball analogy,

25:59.273 --> 26:01.817
this profile
is practically gonna write itself.

26:03.569 --> 26:05.738
You didn't ask me about Mitch
or any of that stuff.

26:05.821 --> 26:08.157
I don't have time for boilerplate denials.

26:08.574 --> 26:09.867
I've got what I need.

26:14.497 --> 26:15.748
You think you've got it.

26:16.874 --> 26:18.042
Is that right?

26:18.459 --> 26:21.962
Well, I'm not writing that story anyway.

26:22.046 --> 26:26.217
Which, seems to me, should come
as a major relief to you, Chip.

26:27.301 --> 26:29.053
Mag... Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.138
Can you... Can you do me a favor?

26:31.222 --> 26:33.599
Can you fucking trust me
for a second here, please?

26:35.851 --> 26:36.852
What?

26:38.020 --> 26:40.397
Look, I'm trying to... I can tell you...

26:41.941 --> 26:43.984
I can share with you some things,

26:45.653 --> 26:47.571
point you toward things

26:47.655 --> 26:51.700
that incriminate the network
to the highest level.

26:51.784 --> 26:55.454
Primarily, the highest fucking level.

26:56.539 --> 27:01.460
Obviously this would have to be
on deep, deep fucking background.

27:02.336 --> 27:07.174
And if you're interested, I'd want you to
get back to me sooner rather than later.

27:09.969 --> 27:12.096
Do I understand what you're saying to me?

27:13.347 --> 27:14.807
Yes, you understand.

27:17.017 --> 27:18.519
This isn't like you.

27:19.228 --> 27:21.814
You have the reputation as a good soldier.

27:22.481 --> 27:24.733
Yeah.
Well, this good soldier's not really...

27:25.484 --> 27:27.945
Not really sure what
he's protecting anymore, you know, so...

27:30.531 --> 27:32.825
What's making you feel bold?

27:35.661 --> 27:37.997
What if it was 15 years of complicity?

27:38.414 --> 27:39.540
No. Sorry.

27:40.124 --> 27:42.209
You don't grow a conscience overnight.

27:42.835 --> 27:45.546
Not when you're in charge
of the jewel asset

27:45.629 --> 27:47.923
of a multibillion-dollar corporation.

27:48.007 --> 27:49.550
You grow a conscience...

27:50.384 --> 27:55.389
when someone from that corporation
gives you permission to have one.

27:58.058 --> 28:00.436
Maggie,
I'm offering you a really good story here.

28:00.519 --> 28:02.605
And I'm looking for the better one.

28:05.357 --> 28:06.358
Okay.

28:07.026 --> 28:10.237
Let's both think about it,
and I'll call you.

28:21.457 --> 28:25.294
Cory, my office is going to reach out
to yours about setting a meeting.

28:25.711 --> 28:26.921
Ooh. Okay.

28:27.379 --> 28:28.923
Fun. Who with?

28:29.006 --> 28:30.716
No. Don't tell me. I like to be surprised.

28:30.799 --> 28:32.092
It's with Marlon Tate.

28:32.176 --> 28:34.720
Potential EP candidate
for <i>The Morning Show.</i>

28:39.016 --> 28:40.726
Chip finally had that heart attack?

28:40.809 --> 28:42.520
Damn it. Condolences.

28:43.103 --> 28:45.147
The internal investigation
will wrap up soon.

28:45.231 --> 28:46.833
We don't know what will be in the report,

28:46.857 --> 28:49.777
and we need
to be ready with contingencies.

28:50.194 --> 28:52.446
Marlon's good. I've known him for years.

28:52.863 --> 28:55.282
Came up in evening news,
but he gets the morning audience.

28:55.366 --> 28:57.368
Thank you for the recommendation, Fred.

28:57.952 --> 28:59.578
It's not a recommendation.

29:00.538 --> 29:01.580
Marlon's the guy.

29:09.296 --> 29:10.506
I hear you, Fred.

29:11.674 --> 29:14.885
And as head of the news division,
I'll take it under advisement.

29:20.891 --> 29:22.935
Is there something
you'd like to say to me?

29:27.857 --> 29:28.858
Yes.

29:32.528 --> 29:34.905
- Are you happy, Fred?
- 'Scuse me?

29:34.989 --> 29:37.408
Are you like a happy person in life?

29:37.491 --> 29:39.910
I know you have a wife,
a couple houses and a network,

29:39.994 --> 29:42.997
but you don't seem very fulfilled
by any of it.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.374
I honestly
don't think I've ever seen you smile

29:45.457 --> 29:47.251
for more than a second or two in a row.

29:47.334 --> 29:50.796
Which is too bad,
because smiling, it's fun to smile.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.131
It feels good.

29:52.548 --> 29:54.884
You should spend
more time doing things that you enjoy.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.636
Maybe you'll have more time
to do that soon. I sure hope so.

29:57.720 --> 30:01.265
It's just some personal advice.
Take it or leave it.

30:01.348 --> 30:02.892
I thought I'd share...

30:04.685 --> 30:08.397
before you find yourself
left with nothing but a permanent frown.

30:12.568 --> 30:14.570
Let me know how it goes with Marlon.

30:28.209 --> 30:33.464
Okay. So, unfortunately,
this is not the best time to get divorced.

30:35.966 --> 30:39.929
Are you suggesting that there
is a good time to get divorced?

30:40.596 --> 30:43.724
Well, if someone
has been the victim of abuse,

30:44.308 --> 30:47.019
filing for divorce
is perceived to be empowering.

30:47.102 --> 30:49.271
It's someone taking back
the reins on their own life.

30:49.355 --> 30:50.731
[ALEX] Mm-hmm.

30:50.814 --> 30:53.400
- Is there anything there?
- Abuse?

30:54.151 --> 30:56.487
Um. Oh. [CHUCKLES]

30:57.196 --> 31:00.491
Nope. No abuse. Bummer.

31:00.825 --> 31:02.243
Yeah, cross that off.

31:02.326 --> 31:05.204
Oh, my gosh.
Are you really kidding me with this?

31:05.746 --> 31:09.542
It's a marriage. Marriages end.
I mean, my God.

31:09.625 --> 31:13.379
Especially celebrity marriages, I mean,
they should be measured in dog years.

31:14.088 --> 31:15.172
[CHUCKLES]

31:15.589 --> 31:18.217
Jason and I would be celebrating
140 years.

31:19.009 --> 31:20.094
Success.

31:20.427 --> 31:22.388
That's not how people are gonna see it.

31:22.471 --> 31:25.975
First of all, they're gonna wonder
if you were having an affair with Mitch.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.518
- Mm.
- And if you did, that's okay.

31:27.601 --> 31:30.646
- Okay.
- You just... should tell us.

31:30.729 --> 31:32.769
- It's better to get ahead of these things.
- Right.

31:32.815 --> 31:37.236
Either way, people are definitely
going to notice that Mitch's wife

31:37.319 --> 31:40.823
filed for divorce
right before your divorce was announced.

31:41.407 --> 31:45.202
And then there's the matter
of which of you files for the divorce.

31:45.619 --> 31:48.622
If you file, people will think
that it makes you look heartless.

31:48.706 --> 31:52.418
If Jason files, people will think
that he caught you with another man.

31:52.835 --> 31:56.630
Either that or he just couldn't put up
with a high-maintenance celebrity anymore,

31:56.714 --> 31:58.424
which makes you read pathetic.

31:58.507 --> 32:03.262
Unless of course, Jason was cheating
on you with, let's say, a younger woman.

32:03.596 --> 32:05.097
That plays well.

32:05.181 --> 32:07.016
People will look at you with pity.

32:07.099 --> 32:09.143
But it's pity mixed with sympathy,

32:09.685 --> 32:11.645
so definitely let us know about that.

32:11.729 --> 32:13.689
[LOW RUMBLING IN DISTANCE]

32:17.234 --> 32:20.279
[WOMAN]
Daniel, your show is a fucking car crash.

32:20.738 --> 32:24.408
Even I'm watching.
I mean, Alex crying over that fucking dog.

32:24.492 --> 32:26.952
Who would turn away?
But it's not gonna last.

32:27.995 --> 32:30.414
Look, you're on the winning team for now.

32:30.498 --> 32:32.917
But the real beauty
about being on the number-two show

32:33.000 --> 32:36.962
is that they will spend whatever it takes
on talent to get them to number one.

32:37.046 --> 32:39.590
The remuneration at UBA is not my problem.

32:39.673 --> 32:40.674
What is your problem?

32:40.758 --> 32:45.012
Because my problem is UBA
parading around a couple of white women

32:45.095 --> 32:48.432
to show how progressive the network is
for having two female coanchors

32:48.516 --> 32:50.236
while the brown people
are left to make sure

32:50.267 --> 32:52.467
that the trains
of their dresses don't touch the ground.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.730
I would be outraged.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.941
This is the thing that outrages me.

32:57.900 --> 33:01.987
<i>TMS</i> pulled me from a job
which I actually liked,

33:02.655 --> 33:04.698
wooed me based on my political acumen,

33:04.782 --> 33:08.702
promised me a space
to do what I love to do.

33:09.578 --> 33:13.624
Instead,
they have me doing the fucking <i>Twist</i>.

33:14.291 --> 33:19.922
So while, once again, my ego loves
that you're interested in me...

33:20.005 --> 33:20.840
Mm-hmm.

33:20.923 --> 33:24.635
My fear is that <i>YDA</i>
would just be a lateral move

33:24.718 --> 33:26.929
to a longer version of <i>The Twist</i>.

33:28.430 --> 33:30.140
I want to do the news.

33:30.224 --> 33:32.351
I want people to be excited about it.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.436
And I want that to be enough.

33:37.356 --> 33:40.818
See? This is why I want you on <i>YDA.</i>

33:41.235 --> 33:46.782
Daniel, you are a beautiful, deep-feeling,
boring man who loves hard news.

33:46.866 --> 33:49.201
- I'm not kidding.
- Neither am I.

33:49.285 --> 33:51.412
Okay, people watch <i>YDA</i> because it's fun.

33:51.495 --> 33:54.874
It's light, it's poppy.
And Jimmy and I, we have that covered.

33:54.957 --> 33:58.836
Hell, I enjoy interviewing the surviving
members of the Bay City Rollers.

33:58.919 --> 34:01.922
But we are never going
to beat <i>TMS</i> by being fun.

34:02.006 --> 34:05.426
We need boring. We need gravitas.

34:05.509 --> 34:07.469
We need political credibility.

34:07.553 --> 34:09.471
And you have that coming out the wazoo.

34:09.555 --> 34:11.182
<i>TMS</i> is vulnerable right now.

34:12.516 --> 34:14.518
There are people there that I care about,

34:14.977 --> 34:17.521
people that would be hurt if I jump.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.648
Alison, Yanko...

34:19.732 --> 34:23.527
Yes. I know. Your lovely friends
at the <i>Minority Report</i>.

34:23.611 --> 34:25.279
- Low blow.
- Accurate.

34:26.113 --> 34:29.408
Still. It's not easy.

34:30.075 --> 34:33.204
Well, the <i>TMS</i> family is broken,

34:33.621 --> 34:37.458
and it never really included anyone
whose name wasn't Mitch or Alex.

34:41.962 --> 34:45.633
[BRADLEY] And, you know, if you've
seen it on WebMD or something.

34:45.716 --> 34:47.777

but tell them I don't wanna know.

- All right.
- Thank you.

34:50.596 --> 34:51.972
Where's the rest of the family?

34:52.056 --> 34:54.141
I don't know.
Maybe they're walking the dog.

34:54.767 --> 34:55.976
Funny kind of family.

34:56.894 --> 34:59.647
Yep. Dysfunctional.

35:00.064 --> 35:01.565
Just like a real family.

- Yeah.

35:13.661 --> 35:14.912
- Um...
- Yeah.

35:15.663 --> 35:21.000
So, apparently I have to announce
my divorce on the show sometime next week.

35:21.085 --> 35:22.962
- Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

35:23.045 --> 35:26.841
I just wanted to give you the heads-up.
So, be prepared for some awkward airtime.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.884
Well, awkward airtime is my specialty.

35:28.968 --> 35:31.053
- [CHUCKLES]
- But thank you for the heads-up.

35:31.136 --> 35:34.181
Yeah. And obviously this stays between us.

35:34.598 --> 35:36.058
- Of course.
- Okay. Thank you.

35:36.141 --> 35:38.268
I just have to be
so careful about what I say.

35:38.686 --> 35:42.605
I mean, I just met with this PR woman
who scared the crap out of me.

35:43.190 --> 35:47.111
Reminded me that I'm walking
into this land mine of speculation and...

35:47.652 --> 35:51.323
about my marriage and my sanity and...

35:52.158 --> 35:53.325
Mitch.

35:53.951 --> 35:55.953
Fuck, I don't know, you and me.

35:56.036 --> 35:57.580
Maybe you and I are in love.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.840
- God, that would be preferable.
- [CHUCKLES]

36:00.457 --> 36:02.668
- Well, that all sounds brutal.
- Mm.

36:02.751 --> 36:03.951
I'm here if you need anything.

36:04.545 --> 36:05.671
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

36:05.754 --> 36:06.881
Wait.

36:07.923 --> 36:08.966
Actually.

36:10.885 --> 36:13.012
Maybe we could work on something together?

36:14.638 --> 36:16.056
For your divorce announcement?

36:16.515 --> 36:19.852
Yeah. I mean, you're sitting right there

- when I have to do it.
- Right.

36:21.562 --> 36:23.606
You know,
we could make it into a dialogue.

36:29.653 --> 36:30.946
um...

36:31.030 --> 36:32.239
being human.

36:33.032 --> 36:34.074
Couldn't hurt.

36:35.868 --> 36:40.289
I mean, we could workshop it
over dinner tonight at my apartment.

36:41.540 --> 36:43.542
- Oh, um, that would be great.
- Yeah?

36:43.626 --> 36:46.712
No. Yeah. I would love that.
Um, I'll bring some food.

36:46.795 --> 36:48.398
Oh, you don't have to do that.
I have it covered.

36:48.422 --> 36:49.924

- [MAN] Okay, ladies.

[WOMAN] Now, Claire,

42:41.150 --> 42:44.945
Mr. Flores has stated that he'd like to go
on public record about this relationship.

42:45.029 --> 42:46.572
Well, he spoke,

42:46.655 --> 42:49.533
but we'd both like to
go on record publicly,

42:50.534 --> 42:53.287
but ideally confidentially,
if that's an option.

42:53.704 --> 42:58.542
Well, what I need to better understand
is how this relationship began.

42:59.835 --> 43:02.588
Did you initiate an intimate relationship?

43:03.547 --> 43:06.050
No, I did not.
No. And I never would've thought of that.

43:06.133 --> 43:08.552
No, we became friends, you know?

43:09.261 --> 43:11.263
Claire would...
She'd come in with her research,

43:11.347 --> 43:16.060
and she was willing to listen and
genuinely engage with my work.

43:16.143 --> 43:17.978
Which is not always the case.

43:18.062 --> 43:19.188
People rely on the weather,

43:19.271 --> 43:21.690
but they have a problem
taking it seriously.

43:21.774 --> 43:22.775
Not Claire.

43:22.858 --> 43:26.570
His brain is just really fucking sexy.

43:26.654 --> 43:30.407
It didn't seem like a crime to
transition that feeling into actual sex.

43:30.491 --> 43:31.611
I never said it was a crime.

43:31.659 --> 43:34.787
I'm merely asking how
your first sexual encounter came about.

43:36.121 --> 43:38.791
"Merely asking." That's a very polite way

43:38.874 --> 43:41.377
to ask something that's
really none of your business.

43:41.794 --> 43:44.713
No. I was the one who stopped the kiss.

43:46.131 --> 43:48.968
Look, of course I worried
that it was inappropriate.

43:50.594 --> 43:53.013
I was in deep denial
about my own feelings.

43:53.097 --> 43:55.891
I was. She was completely unfazed.

43:55.975 --> 43:58.102
I mean, she told me that she liked me,

43:58.185 --> 44:00.271
and that she liked me for a while.

44:00.354 --> 44:02.273
And I was knocked back by that.

44:02.356 --> 44:04.275
Yes, we had sex that night.

44:04.358 --> 44:06.277
Yes, it was at Yanko's apartment.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.588
But only because he's the one
who actually knows how to cook,

44:08.612 --> 44:10.531
and I like a good fucking paella.

44:10.948 --> 44:12.283
So then I asked her to dinner,

44:12.366 --> 44:15.035
and then we both just thought
it was smarter to keep it private.

44:15.119 --> 44:18.956
Look, I hit on him. I'm the creep here.

44:19.373 --> 44:21.500
I never said either of you were creeps.

44:21.584 --> 44:23.794
Mm, but that's the implication, isn't it?

44:23.878 --> 44:25.918
That he has to have been
tricking me into liking him

44:25.963 --> 44:29.383
because of the very nature
of his professional position of power.

44:29.466 --> 44:32.011
We've thought many, many times
about coming forward and...

44:32.094 --> 44:34.513
And yet only when summoned
did you actually come...

44:34.597 --> 44:37.224
Right. And you could
choose to indict us for that.

44:37.641 --> 44:40.895
And you could choose
to compare the nature of our relationship

44:40.978 --> 44:43.105
with the despicable acts
committed by Mitch Kessler.

44:43.189 --> 44:45.191
You have to understand something, Sheila.

44:45.524 --> 44:48.944
That was the very fear
that motivated us to stay silent.

44:49.612 --> 44:53.240
Has Mr. Flores ever asked you
to do things you're uncomfortable with?

44:56.285 --> 44:57.286
No.

44:58.037 --> 44:59.038
Never?

44:59.955 --> 45:03.083
Well, I suppose he asked me to come here,
and now I feel uncomfortable.

45:07.213 --> 45:10.424
Look, the work you do
here in this room is noble.

45:10.508 --> 45:13.719
Okay? And I appreciate
all of the tough questions, I do.

45:13.802 --> 45:19.183
But Claire and I hope that
we can represent a new way to navigate

45:19.934 --> 45:22.269
this kind of a workplace relationship.

45:22.353 --> 45:26.357
Would you consider
your relationship with Mr. Flores serious?

45:28.734 --> 45:30.319
Why... Why is that relevant?

45:30.736 --> 45:32.822
Because it's our job to examine

45:32.905 --> 45:36.116
whether the two of you working
in the same environment is sustainable.

45:38.202 --> 45:40.746
- Are you saying I could be fired?
- Well, it's just...

45:40.830 --> 45:42.873
But you're not going
to fire the fucking weatherman.

Claire, I'm not saying that
anything's gonna happen to anyone.

45:45.042 --> 45:48.379
I really don't want to be here.
This was a mistake.

45:48.462 --> 45:49.588
Do you need a minute?

45:49.672 --> 45:51.382
No, I need to get out
of this fucking room.

45:51.465 --> 45:54.009
Claire, it's our responsibility
to ask these questions.

45:54.093 --> 45:57.346
And I feel like
I'm still entitled to a shred of privacy.

45:57.429 --> 45:58.973
You chose to come here.

45:59.056 --> 46:00.724
I didn't choose anything.

46:02.309 --> 46:03.477

I'm so sorry.

50:28.534 --> 50:29.785
Why is this happening now?

50:32.121 --> 50:34.281
Does it have something
to do with all this Mitch stuff?

50:36.959 --> 50:39.253
No. Of course not.

50:39.336 --> 50:40.379
Really?

50:41.046 --> 50:43.883

melting down ever since he left,

50:59.565 --> 51:02.485
Lizzy. How do you read Page Six
and believe it?

51:07.198 --> 51:08.741
Okay. Lizzy...

51:14.788 --> 51:16.165
I know this hurts.

51:18.209 --> 51:20.377
It doesn't hurt you. You don't care.

What?

51:22.046 --> 51:26.217
Dad loves you so much.
He does everything for you.

51:27.885 --> 51:29.512
Why isn't he good enough?

51:29.595 --> 51:33.641
Oh, honey, this... This has nothing to do
with your father not being good enough.

51:33.724 --> 51:36.435
He's smart. He's handsome. He's funny.

51:36.519 --> 51:38.604
He's a respected professor at NYU.

51:38.687 --> 51:42.566
He's written best-selling books
on world economics, for fuck's sake.

51:42.650 --> 51:44.610
I know all of that, honey.
I know all of it.

51:44.693 --> 51:47.112
Then how can you be so selfish?

51:56.288 --> 52:01.544
Oh, Lizzy. Honey.
The thing is you're only seeing this

52:01.627 --> 52:04.588
from the part that you can see,
and that's as it should be.

52:06.757 --> 52:10.636
But 25 years is a really long time.

52:13.681 --> 52:15.891
We were two completely different people
when we met.

52:17.393 --> 52:18.394
And we just...

52:21.730 --> 52:24.441
I just don't feel the same way anymore.

52:24.859 --> 52:26.402
And I haven't for years.

52:28.571 --> 52:30.990
And I have tried, baby. I've tried.

52:32.992 --> 52:35.578
And I can't tell you how lonely I've been.

52:38.539 --> 52:41.250
And I know this makes you angry and hurt.

52:41.876 --> 52:45.087
But I just want you to try to see
that there is a bigger picture here.

52:45.171 --> 52:48.215
Well, I can't right now, Mom.
I'm too fucking hurt and angry.

52:48.299 --> 52:50.259
Okay. No, honey, let's just...
Please, come on.

52:51.468 --> 52:54.471
We've always been there for each other.
Always.

52:56.724 --> 52:59.685
You're my baby.
Let's just not do this right now.

52:59.768 --> 53:01.103
You need to leave.

53:01.187 --> 53:03.189
I can't even believe
what you're doing now.

53:05.316 --> 53:07.234
What am... What am I doing?

53:07.318 --> 53:10.112
I'm not going
to take care of you right now.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.875
Okay. Okay. Then I will leave.

53:22.958 --> 53:26.253
Great. Go share it with America.
They'll take care of you.

53:31.425 --> 53:32.718
Did you really just say that?

53:32.801 --> 53:34.762
Yeah, I did. I just said, "Fuck you."

53:35.638 --> 53:38.098
And, I mean, how fucking dare you.

53:38.849 --> 53:42.561
After all that I have done
and all that I have given to you.

53:43.103 --> 53:46.106
My life. My love. My body.

53:46.941 --> 53:50.861
I broke my fucking vagina
with that big, fucking head of yours.

53:50.945 --> 53:52.947
And I had to be surgically
sewn back together.

53:53.030 --> 53:54.470
I bet you didn't know that, did you?

53:54.949 --> 53:57.701
Oh, and effing just staying
with your father

53:58.244 --> 54:02.665
after all these years of him driving me
insane with his condescending "my loves."

54:03.082 --> 54:06.794
He talked to me like I was a fucking
five-year-old, and I am sick of it.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.254
I am sick of it.

54:08.337 --> 54:11.423
I want happiness. I earned happiness.

54:11.507 --> 54:13.551
I'm a human being, Lizzy.

54:14.677 --> 54:15.678
And you know what else?

54:15.761 --> 54:19.223
Don't you dare bitch at me
about my career,

54:19.723 --> 54:22.434
little Miss I'm-So-Progressive.

54:22.518 --> 54:26.856
Yes, I worked my ass off
to get where I am.

54:27.648 --> 54:28.941
And I wanted it.

54:29.900 --> 54:34.321
I wanted to be something.
I wanted to mean something in this world.

54:34.864 --> 54:36.866
I didn't know that was a fucking crime.

54:37.491 --> 54:39.034
Life isn't perfect, okay, baby?

54:39.118 --> 54:40.619
We don't get everything we want.

54:40.703 --> 54:43.080
You're young, you know?
Go make the life that you want,

54:43.164 --> 54:44.790
and you see how fucking easy it is.

54:45.249 --> 54:49.336
And stop bitching
and complaining and blaming me.

54:50.588 --> 54:52.423
