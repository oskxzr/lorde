WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.406
...cohost approval.

00:03.407 --> 00:06.868
Start putting together a list of names,
men who can sit next to Alex for now

00:06.869 --> 00:09.120
and also work with someone younger
once she's gone.

00:09.121 --> 00:10.204
Rapist!

00:10.205 --> 00:12.165
Sexual misconduct
is what I'm being accused of.

00:12.166 --> 00:13.875
Don't you wave your fucking hand at me!

00:13.876 --> 00:15.001
- Your show sucks.
- Please.

00:15.002 --> 00:16.753
You really think this is gonna
help you get a job?

00:16.754 --> 00:20.089
People like you are the reason
broadcast news is what it is.

00:20.090 --> 00:24.469
Do not show your face tonight.
Do not do that to Alex.

00:24.470 --> 00:26.471
My tux is pressed.

00:26.472 --> 00:27.764
I can't unpress my tux.

00:27.765 --> 00:30.683
Cory would like for you to be at the
Leadership in Journalism event tonight.

00:30.684 --> 00:33.019
I'm confused.
I had a meeting with Chip Charlie Black,

00:33.020 --> 00:34.896
and it did not go well.

00:34.897 --> 00:36.355
You remember Bradley Jackson?

00:36.356 --> 00:37.648
Oh, my God.

00:37.649 --> 00:40.401
But why is she sitting at that table
over there with our people?

00:40.402 --> 00:43.279
He sat you at my table to fuck with me.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.447
Me fuck with you?

00:44.448 --> 00:46.199
I'm not closing without cohost approval.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.284
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
because you're not getting it.

00:48.285 --> 00:49.452
Then I'll walk.

00:49.453 --> 00:50.828
Then walk.

00:50.829 --> 00:54.499
I have some exciting news
to share with all of you tonight.

00:54.500 --> 00:59.711
I would like to announce
my new <i>Morning Show</i> cohost...

00:59.713 --> 01:11.297
Bradley Jackson.

02:57.829 --> 03:04.627
I would like to take this moment to
announce my new Morning Show cohost,

03:04.628 --> 03:16.380
Bradley Jackson.

04:15.490 --> 04:17.074
Don't look too surprised.

04:17.075 --> 04:18.826
- All right, stand up. Up.
- Okay.

04:18.827 --> 04:20.870
- Bradley!
- Bradley!

04:20.871 --> 04:23.456
- Miss Jackson!
- Bradley, how are you feeling?

04:23.457 --> 04:25.416
- Smile. Smile.
- How do you feel right now, Miss Jackson?

04:25.417 --> 04:26.834
Is she drunk?

04:26.835 --> 04:28.127
That would make sense.

04:28.128 --> 04:31.214
Get her to the studio.
Don't let either of them make statements.

04:31.215 --> 04:36.344
She is the perfect person for the job,
and you will see what I'm talking about.

04:36.345 --> 04:37.803
Yeah.

04:37.804 --> 04:40.097
Hope you had fun up there.

04:40.098 --> 04:42.391
Oh, I'm really excited too.

04:42.392 --> 04:47.104
- Are you both gonna be lead anchors?
- Bradley.

04:47.105 --> 04:48.564
Let's go. Let's go.

04:48.565 --> 04:49.899
Bradley, Bradley,

04:49.900 --> 04:51.692
- Maggie Brener, New York Magazine.
- Hi.

04:51.693 --> 04:55.196
- Congratulations on...
- Maggie, my love. Tonight is a tease.

04:55.197 --> 04:59.700
But, Cory, how'd you manage
to keep such a delightful secret?

04:59.701 --> 05:03.329
Well, you guys are only interested
in the obvious choices.

05:03.330 --> 05:06.332
Bradley Jackson isn't obvious.

05:06.333 --> 05:09.168
After Mitch, we felt we needed
a big change and quickly.

05:09.169 --> 05:14.006
One that makes a statement
about where we intend to go.

05:14.007 --> 05:23.474
Where is that?

05:23.475 --> 05:27.061
If you guys wanna know more...

05:27.062 --> 05:31.315
tune in on Monday
for Alex and Bradley's first show.

05:31.316 --> 05:33.526
Bradley.
Bradley, how excited are you?

05:33.527 --> 05:35.820
How long are you gonna be
with this network?

05:35.821 --> 05:38.114
What are you fucking doing?

05:38.115 --> 05:40.908
Congratulations, Bradley Jackson.

05:40.909 --> 05:42.785
Your life just took off.

05:42.786 --> 05:45.162
Don't say anything to anyone
and meet me at the studio.

05:45.163 --> 05:47.290
You're changing the game.
How does it feel?

05:47.291 --> 05:49.792
- Bradley! Bradley.
- Are you excited to work with Miss Levy?

05:49.793 --> 05:52.503
What is the statement that you would like
to make to young women?

05:52.504 --> 05:54.672
- I don't...
- Hey, let's get you outta here.

05:54.673 --> 05:56.340
They're looking at you
like you're raw meat.

05:56.341 --> 05:57.884
- Okay.
- Okay. We're going this way.

05:57.885 --> 05:59.343
- Bradley!
- Excuse me.

05:59.344 --> 06:01.762
This way.

06:01.763 --> 06:05.057
Oh, my God. What the hell just happened?

06:05.058 --> 06:07.560
They'll have answers for us at the studio.
Chip knows we're on our way.

06:07.561 --> 06:09.812
Oh, no, no. I'm going to LaGuardia.
LaGuardia, please.

06:09.813 --> 06:12.440
- We're not going to LaGuardia...
- Yes.

06:12.441 --> 06:15.943
And with all due respect, who the hell
are you to tell me what to do?

06:15.944 --> 06:18.946
Do you have a cigarette?

06:18.947 --> 06:20.698
Twenty bucks.

06:20.699 --> 06:23.367
Bravo, buddy.
Way to take advantage of a woman in need.

06:23.368 --> 06:26.245
Do you have $20?

06:26.246 --> 06:30.416
Yeah. Cory put it on public record
that the show is launching on Monday.

06:30.417 --> 06:31.959
Yeah, well, he's insane too.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.879
Agreed. But let's for one moment
assume you are the coanchor.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.089
You can assume that.
I don't want to assume that.

06:37.090 --> 06:40.092
I'm going to LaGuardia.
I don't wanna be the coanchor.

06:40.093 --> 06:41.385
Why the hell not?

06:41.386 --> 06:44.472
Because they're gonna use me
to try and get an Eagle News audience

06:44.473 --> 06:47.433
that I won't attract
because I'm not that kinda conservative.

06:47.434 --> 06:48.684
But you don't know that,

06:48.685 --> 06:51.771
because there's no way in hell
that I have been vetted.

06:51.772 --> 06:55.650
And I am being set up here
to be some sort of fall guy,

06:55.651 --> 06:57.026
and I am not interested in that.

06:57.027 --> 06:58.611
Not interested.

06:58.612 --> 06:59.695
Do you have a light?

06:59.696 --> 07:01.948
No smoking, ma'am.

07:01.949 --> 07:04.116
You've gotta be kidding me.

07:04.117 --> 07:06.494
What the hell were you thinking?

07:06.495 --> 07:10.206
Why would you back that unhinged woman
to a room full of reporters?

07:10.207 --> 07:11.707
You were given clear instructions.

07:11.708 --> 07:15.503
Why would you box us in
to a Monday launch with that nobody?

07:15.504 --> 07:18.923
I feel it's a bit dismissive to refer to
them as "unhinged woman" and "nobody."

07:18.924 --> 07:22.009
Don't fuck with me. I need to understand
how you plan to fix this.

07:22.010 --> 07:25.930
Or explain to me
why I shouldn't fire you along with Levy?

07:25.931 --> 07:31.644
Well, because that "unhinged woman"
did us a serious favor.

07:31.645 --> 07:35.565
Look, this show slipped in the ratings,
Fred, because the show is stale.

07:35.566 --> 07:38.818
Alex Levy, her sell-by date,
it expired years ago.

07:38.819 --> 07:40.778
She needed to go.
Everybody knew we were gonna fire her,

07:40.779 --> 07:43.322
but Mitch fucked that up
by fucking everything.

07:43.323 --> 07:45.241
So, now, everybody's curious.
What are we gonna do?

07:45.242 --> 07:48.119
So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna give her this victory.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.705
A Pyrrhic victory.
Make her think that she's won.

07:50.706 --> 07:54.375
But really, we're gonna let
this "nobody" in to freshen the show.

07:54.376 --> 07:58.045
Juice the ratings for sweeps and finally
push Alex Levy off the shelf for good

07:58.046 --> 08:00.256
when it is convenient for us

08:00.257 --> 08:03.801
and when we don't have to look
like the bad guys.

08:03.802 --> 08:06.554
That doesn't explain
why we have to rush them out for Monday.

08:06.555 --> 08:07.638
Well, the streak.

08:07.639 --> 08:10.558
If we don't do something next week,
the streak is over.

08:10.559 --> 08:14.770
YDA is not sneaking up on us,
they're breathing down our fucking necks,

08:14.771 --> 08:18.316
in spite of our "Mitch is a predator"
boost. It feels old.

08:18.317 --> 08:21.944
People are getting too used to their
favorite cuddly men turning into monsters,

08:21.945 --> 08:27.533
but watching a beloved woman's breakdown

08:27.534 --> 08:35.291
is timeless American entertainment.

08:35.292 --> 08:38.711
The Morning Show audience
values stability.

08:38.712 --> 08:43.257
When has it been the case that a morning
audience prefers fighting over family?

08:43.258 --> 08:45.176
I don't know. Families fight, Fred.

08:45.177 --> 08:49.222
Look, all right, hey, give me a month
of "The Alex and Bradley Show,"

08:49.223 --> 08:53.017
either they work well together,
or it's horrible.

08:53.018 --> 08:57.104
Regardless, putting Bradley in
lets us get back to replacing Alex.

08:57.105 --> 09:01.234
And it'll be interesting
and fun, fresh, you know,

09:01.235 --> 09:05.196
which is imperative right now.

09:05.197 --> 09:07.698
I'm gonna make something clear.

09:07.699 --> 09:13.829
I have an easy fall guy
when all this goes to shit.

09:13.830 --> 09:15.748
Oh, we're talking about me, right?

09:15.749 --> 09:19.585
Chaos, it's the new cocaine, Fred.

09:19.586 --> 09:20.920
You screwed yourself.

09:20.921 --> 09:24.549
Committed a fireable offense,
overtly in breach of contract.

09:24.550 --> 09:29.345
We'll be lucky if the network
even continues negotiations.

09:29.346 --> 09:33.808
You need to go in and find Fred
and apologize tonight.

09:33.809 --> 09:37.895
Right, right.
Is there an alternative option?

09:37.896 --> 09:39.981
Not unless you wanna pull the rehab card.

09:39.982 --> 09:42.233
We could say you were emotional
about Mitch.

09:42.234 --> 09:44.360
But I'm not emotional about Mitch.

09:44.361 --> 09:46.320
I was emotional because
no one's fucking listening to me!

09:46.321 --> 09:49.114
Mom! What's going on? Are you? Are you...

09:49.115 --> 09:51.617
- Yes, I'm fine. Sorry.
- Let's just take a beat here, please.

09:51.618 --> 09:55.454
- Sarah, listen. I'm going to handle this.
- It's okay. It's okay.

09:55.455 --> 09:58.124
Then put on your apology face
and fucking mean it.

09:58.125 --> 10:02.295
- Absolutely. I completely understand.
- Do you understand?

10:02.296 --> 10:03.462
Guys, guys.

10:03.463 --> 10:07.258
Listen, don't...
Honey, baby. Honey, listen to me.

10:07.259 --> 10:11.429
Sometimes women can't ask for control.

10:11.430 --> 10:15.766
So, they have to take it, okay?

10:15.767 --> 10:16.851
Okay.

10:16.852 --> 10:19.896
I want you to remember that. Okay, baby?

10:19.897 --> 10:31.273
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:32.743 --> 10:36.662
Okay. Everybody knows you're here.
They want you to sit tight for 15 minutes.

10:36.663 --> 10:37.872
I will not sit tight.

10:37.873 --> 10:39.165
There are some snacks. Some TV.

10:39.166 --> 10:41.125
There's definitely some booze
around here somewhere.

10:41.126 --> 10:42.627
They're deciding my life out there.

10:42.628 --> 10:45.171
Yes, and I know that's insane,
but Alex is meeting with the CEO.

10:45.172 --> 10:48.174
Chip is gathering the staff, and if you're
even remotely considering doing this...

10:48.175 --> 10:49.383
I don't know what this is.

10:49.384 --> 10:50.927
You need to let them come to you.

10:50.928 --> 10:53.971
You need to let yourself take a breath.
Have a fucking drink.

10:53.972 --> 10:58.267
Think about what you want.

10:58.268 --> 11:00.228
Consider this the start
of me being a great producer.

11:00.229 --> 11:08.736
- You're not my producer.
- Yet.

11:08.737 --> 11:13.950
Oh, my God.

11:13.951 --> 11:15.326
Hal, where have you been?

11:15.327 --> 11:18.246
You cannot seriously
be making this about me right now.

11:18.247 --> 11:21.874
Okay? Can we please talk about you?
You're all over the news.

11:21.875 --> 11:22.959
This is so weird.

11:22.960 --> 11:29.840
Yeah, no kidding. Is Mom okay?

11:29.841 --> 11:31.175
She's pissed at me.

11:31.176 --> 11:35.388
She said you embarrassed her with
her friends because you didn't tell her.

11:35.389 --> 11:37.848
I didn't know.

11:37.849 --> 11:41.394
Is this even real?

11:41.395 --> 11:51.821
Fuck, Hal. I hope not.

11:51.822 --> 11:54.699
- Hey. She's waiting in the green room.
- You're a god.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.034
- Is this for real? Or are...
- Fucking hope not.

11:57.035 --> 11:59.829
What the hell was she thinking?
It's a room full of press, and she just...

11:59.830 --> 12:01.873
I think she was thinking
it would be effective.

12:01.874 --> 12:02.957
- Yeah, well...
- So?

12:02.958 --> 12:08.588
Wait till she finds out Bradley Jackson
is a fucking raving lunatic. Jesus.

12:08.589 --> 12:10.464
- Chip.
- What?

12:10.465 --> 12:12.925
I wanna produce her.

12:12.926 --> 12:14.010
Why?

12:14.011 --> 12:16.053
Because I've been in purgatory.
I'm too good for that.

12:16.054 --> 12:18.389
If this is real,
you should put your best person on it,

12:18.390 --> 12:23.019
and you know that's fucking me,
and, honestly, I like her,

12:23.020 --> 12:27.023
which could go a long way
to making this work.

12:27.024 --> 12:29.066
If this works,
it's gonna be a fucking disaster,

12:29.067 --> 12:30.234
and you're gonna be tied to it.

12:30.235 --> 12:33.779
Yeah, I've been tied to disasters before.

12:33.780 --> 12:40.203
I want this, Chip.

12:40.204 --> 12:44.332
Hold on. Let's just get some quiet.
Can I get quiet for two seconds, please?

12:44.333 --> 12:52.965
I refuse to accept any of this as reality.
Fuck. Jesus.

12:52.966 --> 12:55.176
Who died?

12:55.177 --> 12:57.887
Ideally, not my show.

12:57.888 --> 12:59.555
Come on, Chip. Cheer the fuck up.

12:59.556 --> 13:02.975
We're in the middle of an epic rebirth.

13:02.976 --> 13:05.228
So, this is happening?

13:05.229 --> 13:08.397
Look, I do know that this comes
as a bit of a surprise.

13:08.398 --> 13:10.733
Alex jumped the gun a little bit
on the announcement,

13:10.734 --> 13:14.111
but we've been quietly vetting Bradley
for a while now,

13:14.112 --> 13:16.656
looking for someone with
that kind of unpredictable energy.

13:16.657 --> 13:20.117
And I know Monday feels fast.
That's why we hired a veteran.

13:20.118 --> 13:23.704
Not an anchor veteran.
Zero anchor experience, in fact.

13:23.705 --> 13:27.833
But she has got raw talent
coming out of her pores.

13:27.834 --> 13:30.253
And you know it.

13:30.254 --> 13:31.963
So, let's get moving, people.

13:31.964 --> 13:36.008
We've got 48 hours to define
the character of Bradley Jackson.

13:36.009 --> 13:38.344
I want wardrobe tests, screen tests,
makeup tests.

13:38.345 --> 13:40.096
I wanna have those tests focus-grouped.

13:40.097 --> 13:41.597
We need a contract. Where's legal?

13:41.598 --> 13:44.475
I'm telling you,
it's not a given she'll go on air Monday.

13:44.476 --> 13:46.394
Are you legal?

13:46.395 --> 13:51.524
I'm Mia Jordan, Bradley's producer.

13:51.525 --> 13:54.902
Well, that happened fast.

13:54.903 --> 13:58.072
Yeah, I felt I was a few steps behind,

13:58.073 --> 14:05.329
so I wanted one of my best people
to manage the circus.

14:05.330 --> 14:09.667
Well, just make sure
that she can read a teleprompter.

14:09.668 --> 14:15.673
I don't want to rain on the parade,
but I snaked a Mitch accuser from YDA.

14:15.674 --> 14:17.466
- You got a Mitch accuser?
- Yeah.

14:17.467 --> 14:19.802
Not great optics to launch a new anchor

14:19.803 --> 14:22.513
next to a sexual assault victim's
brave return.

14:22.514 --> 14:25.016
Are you kidding me? That's perfect.

14:25.017 --> 14:26.100
What is your name?

14:26.101 --> 14:27.977
- Hannah. I'm head booker.
- Hannah.

14:27.978 --> 14:33.566
Hannah nailed it,
'cause we're creating a safe space here.

14:33.567 --> 14:35.443
It's a feminine space.

14:35.444 --> 14:38.237
This is an era for The Morning Show

14:38.238 --> 14:42.825
where women make the rules
and give voice to the silenced.

14:42.826 --> 14:45.786
Speaking of which,
nobody says a fucking word to the press.

14:45.787 --> 14:47.371
They're gonna be circling us
like vultures.

14:47.372 --> 14:51.834
So, anyone who leaks will be murdered...

14:51.835 --> 14:53.461
career-wise.

14:53.462 --> 15:04.347
Okay. I'm gonna run upstairs
to the public spanking of Alex Levy.

15:04.348 --> 15:05.848
Neal, I have an idea.

15:05.849 --> 15:07.725
I know it's only been a few days,

15:07.726 --> 15:09.602
and I know that you're gonna tell me
it's too soon,

15:09.603 --> 15:14.982
but let's just for a second,
look at the larger context of #MeToo.

15:14.983 --> 15:17.318
It's been, what? Two years?

15:17.319 --> 15:19.237
We're two years in.

15:19.238 --> 15:23.824
I feel that people are screaming
for an honest conversation.

15:23.825 --> 15:26.202
And what do I do?

15:26.203 --> 15:28.079
What do I do best?

15:28.080 --> 15:29.747
I am a journalist.

15:29.748 --> 15:33.668
I can feel when the world needs me
to articulate something for them.

15:33.669 --> 15:37.255
To help them understand.

15:37.256 --> 15:42.760
And believe me, I know this is gonna
require a high degree of sensitivity.

15:42.761 --> 15:46.931
But I fucking love a tightrope. I love it.
It makes me feel alive.

15:46.932 --> 15:49.892
You know what?
Maybe all of this happened for a reason.

15:49.893 --> 15:55.189
Because I think that if I can get
in there, and I can show my face,

15:55.190 --> 15:59.902
and I can look and address
the darkness that exists within...

15:59.903 --> 16:01.571
You're gonna answer...

16:01.572 --> 16:07.493
Fuck.

16:07.494 --> 16:14.500
Who is Bradley Jackson?

16:14.501 --> 16:17.628
Mitch, I love you.

16:17.629 --> 16:19.255
I mean, you know that's true.

16:19.256 --> 16:21.841
You're a fantastic talent.

16:21.842 --> 16:28.890
But the fact of the matter is that
a working relationship is based on work,

16:28.891 --> 16:32.768
and that's not gonna
be happening for a while.

16:32.769 --> 16:39.567
Are you dropping me, Neal?

16:39.568 --> 16:43.237
We have a lot of female clients
that are journalists that we represent.

16:43.238 --> 16:44.322
You understand?

16:44.323 --> 16:46.782
There are certain pressures
brought to bear on us.

16:46.783 --> 16:49.452
Believe me, I wish it was different
than the way it is,

16:49.453 --> 16:51.454
but this is the reality now.

16:51.455 --> 16:53.289
Maybe you should sign Bradley Jackson,

16:53.290 --> 16:56.459
whoever the fuck that is.

16:56.460 --> 16:59.003
Would you like me to leave?

16:59.004 --> 17:10.005
Yes.

17:15.020 --> 17:16.437
I don't feel I need to remind you

17:16.438 --> 17:20.483
that this network has been
very good to you over the years.

17:20.484 --> 17:24.070
We have always shown you
personal and professional respect.

17:24.071 --> 17:27.156
I never anticipated we would be met
with such utter disrespect

17:27.157 --> 17:32.119
and insubordination in return.

17:32.120 --> 17:37.458
This network has every right
to terminate you immediately.

17:37.459 --> 17:40.086
You have placed us
in an impossible situation.

17:40.087 --> 17:42.213
You have embarrassed yourself.

17:42.214 --> 17:46.551
You have done something
unforgivably selfish.

17:46.552 --> 17:50.263
And for what? To what end?

17:50.264 --> 17:53.391
I find myself wondering if we can
even trust you with the privilege

17:53.392 --> 17:59.438
of being on air for The Morning Show.

17:59.439 --> 18:02.358
Are you done?

18:02.359 --> 18:05.945
I'm sorry?

18:05.946 --> 18:12.535
The part you guys never seem to realize
is that you don't have the power anymore.

18:12.536 --> 18:16.455
The news division is held up by my show.

18:16.456 --> 18:21.752
And the only thing keeping us afloat
is me.

18:21.753 --> 18:24.213
Because guess what?

18:24.214 --> 18:28.384
America loves me.

18:28.385 --> 18:32.429
And therefore, I own America.

18:32.430 --> 18:37.810
It seems pretty fucking simple,
but so easy for you guys to forget.

18:37.811 --> 18:39.770
Are you actually trying
to justify your action...

18:39.771 --> 18:41.688
You're not listening!

18:41.689 --> 18:44.984
I don't need to justify anything.

18:44.985 --> 18:49.614
You all are so convinced that you are
the rightful owner of all of the power

18:49.615 --> 18:51.157
that it doesn't even occur to you

18:51.158 --> 18:55.203
that someone else
could be in the driver's seat.

18:55.204 --> 19:00.249
And so, we have to just gingerly step
around your male egos

19:00.250 --> 19:05.004
in order to not burst
this precious little bubble.

19:05.005 --> 19:07.131
Well, surprise!

19:07.132 --> 19:13.471
I'm bursting it.

19:13.472 --> 19:17.433
We are doing this my way.

19:17.434 --> 19:26.776
Because, frankly, I've let you bozos
handle this long enough.

19:26.777 --> 19:38.779
Not the apology you were expecting?

19:47.839 --> 19:51.634
Wanna take a seat?

19:51.635 --> 19:54.011
Is that an invitation or a command?

19:54.012 --> 19:56.514
You sound a little pissed off.

19:56.515 --> 19:58.307
I don't like surprises.

19:58.308 --> 20:00.351
Come on. That was a pretty good surprise.

20:00.352 --> 20:02.603
No. You don't get to make this about me.

20:02.604 --> 20:06.816
You dropped a bomb, and I don't know why.
Maybe you're trying to blow up your life.

20:06.817 --> 20:09.694
Maybe you were angry, which I get,

20:09.695 --> 20:12.113
but you don't have the right
to fuck with me.

20:12.114 --> 20:14.115
Fuck with you? How?

20:14.116 --> 20:17.577
By offering you
the most coveted anchor job in the world?

20:17.578 --> 20:18.661
I don't want your job.

20:18.662 --> 20:21.622
Oh, honey, bullshit.

20:21.623 --> 20:26.085
You are so cocky.
You just think I'm gonna do this?

20:26.086 --> 20:28.254
I know you're going to do this.

20:28.255 --> 20:29.589
I don't have a contract.

20:29.590 --> 20:34.343
Well, great. I just put you
in a great spot to negotiate.

20:34.344 --> 20:36.596
This job is yours.

20:36.597 --> 20:39.181
I'm welcoming you with open arms.

20:39.182 --> 20:43.561
I'm giving you the biggest news platform
you could ever have.

20:43.562 --> 20:46.689
If you're a true journalist,
you don't say no to this.

20:46.690 --> 20:51.736
I'm not sure
this is considered true journalism.

20:51.737 --> 20:58.576
And how many current or former presidents
have you interviewed?

20:58.577 --> 21:01.829
This job requires
a certain kind of positivity.

21:01.830 --> 21:03.206
I'm not a perky person.

21:03.207 --> 21:05.958
I don't care.
I don't want us to be the same.

21:05.959 --> 21:09.378
I'm not looking to groom my replacement.

21:09.379 --> 21:11.631
I want a partner.

21:11.632 --> 21:12.924
Do you?

21:12.925 --> 21:15.259
Or do you want somebody
who's beholden to you?

21:15.260 --> 21:18.512
Somebody who's grateful
that you plucked them from obscurity?

21:18.513 --> 21:24.560
Because if that's what you're hoping for,
I will give you serious buyer's remorse.

21:24.561 --> 21:27.939
You are convinced that you know me.

21:27.940 --> 21:31.067
I can guarantee that you are
underestimating me.

21:31.068 --> 21:35.821
And I am really fucking over
people doing that.

21:35.822 --> 21:38.324
I want you here at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

21:38.325 --> 21:42.662
I suggest that you get up at 5:00.
4:00 on Sunday.

21:42.663 --> 21:46.207
Start getting yourself conditioned.

21:46.208 --> 21:50.670
Alex...

21:50.671 --> 21:52.171
I don't like being used.

21:52.172 --> 21:53.965
Oh, my God.

21:53.966 --> 21:58.761
Could you just try, like, taking advantage
of the situation presented?

21:58.762 --> 22:02.265
That sounds like something
you might enjoy.

22:02.266 --> 22:14.810
Come on. See you tomorrow.

22:21.451 --> 22:23.411
We're gonna hit up
a lot of the nitty-gritty today,

22:23.412 --> 22:26.914
because being a morning show anchor
is the hardest job on television bar none.

22:26.915 --> 22:29.834
So, we're gonna meet with makeup,
wardrobe, we'll do some screen tests.

22:29.835 --> 22:32.336
We'll meet with marketing,
publicity, research.

22:32.337 --> 22:34.463
We're gonna drill transitions.

22:34.464 --> 22:38.050
Look, the other thing is that,
and don't shoot the messenger,

22:38.051 --> 22:39.719
the show will be heavily scripted.

22:39.720 --> 22:40.887
What do you mean by "heavily"?

22:40.888 --> 22:44.015
Completely.
It's gonna be completely scripted.

22:44.016 --> 22:48.186
No, I'm not a novice. I don't like
things to be overtly scripted.

22:48.187 --> 22:51.814
It sort of eliminates any possibility
of something truthful happening.

22:51.815 --> 22:54.483
Plus, I have a habit
of going off-script sometimes.

22:54.484 --> 22:56.110
Two-Fucks Jackson.

22:56.111 --> 22:58.446
Well, I see the research
has finally begun.

22:58.447 --> 23:00.406
I can relate to a good self-sabotage,

23:00.407 --> 23:03.910
but it cannot happen on The Morning Show.

23:03.911 --> 23:08.956
Okay, Mia, listen. I get that you're
excited and y'all want this to work out.

23:08.957 --> 23:11.918
I just don't know how I feel about being
forced onto national television

23:11.919 --> 23:13.920
just to make an ass of myself.

23:13.921 --> 23:17.548
I wanna be clear, by showing up today,
I'm not agreeing to this,

23:17.549 --> 23:21.385
and I'm not signing a contract, okay?

23:21.386 --> 23:25.556
Baby steps, okay?

23:25.557 --> 23:27.225
You know who's the most excited?

23:27.226 --> 23:28.809
- Who?
- Alex.

23:28.810 --> 23:29.894
Seriously.

23:29.895 --> 23:31.938
She's gonna be shepherding you
through this entire weekend,

23:31.939 --> 23:34.565
along with me, of course.

23:34.566 --> 23:37.151
Okay? She really wants
to take a firm hand in this.

23:37.152 --> 23:39.445
- She really cares.
- She does?

23:39.446 --> 23:41.781
Absolutely.
This whole weekend is about you.

23:41.782 --> 23:45.618
Getting to know Bradley Jackson,
who you are, what's important to you.

23:45.619 --> 23:48.829
Really? You think I can define myself?

23:48.830 --> 23:50.540
Absolutely.

23:50.541 --> 23:53.125
This is gonna be fun. Watch.

23:53.126 --> 23:56.921
Can't wait.

23:56.922 --> 23:59.382
You guys, thank you. Thank you, but no.

23:59.383 --> 24:01.926
Fucking no. I'm sorry.
I know you're tired,

24:01.927 --> 24:05.096
and I know you hate me right now,
but I really don't give a shit.

24:05.097 --> 24:10.101
All we have to do is figure out
who Bradley Jackson is next to Alex Levy.

24:10.102 --> 24:13.521
Who do you partner with a 24-karat bitch?

24:13.522 --> 24:15.940
That's actually really funny. Don't...

24:15.941 --> 24:17.817
Good morning.

24:17.818 --> 24:20.570
Oh, good to see you're all
in such good spirits today.

24:20.571 --> 24:22.488
Milk Bar for the writers.

24:22.489 --> 24:26.826
Yes, I'm shamelessly bribing you
with sugar for working overtime.

24:26.827 --> 24:28.536
So, you're joining us?

24:28.537 --> 24:29.954
Absolutely.

24:29.955 --> 24:32.999
We were just discussing the enigma
that is Bradley Jackson.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.292
Fabulous.

24:34.293 --> 24:35.960
So, if you'd give us a few minutes...

24:35.961 --> 24:38.212
No, I'd actually like to get in on that.

24:38.213 --> 24:41.257
- It's actually why I'm here.
- To discuss Bradley?

24:41.258 --> 24:43.968
Among other things.

24:43.969 --> 24:47.388
Look, guys, this is a pressure-cooker
moment, all right?

24:47.389 --> 24:49.307
This is a massive transition.

24:49.308 --> 24:51.267
We are redefining ourselves,

24:51.268 --> 24:55.354
and I need to make sure
that we are all on the same page.

24:55.355 --> 24:57.648
So I'm gonna be here all weekend.

24:57.649 --> 24:59.483
- All weekend?
- Yeah, all weekend.

24:59.484 --> 25:01.068
Sean typed up a schedule. Sean.

25:01.069 --> 25:02.987
So, I spoke to wardrobe,

25:02.988 --> 25:07.825
and they're going to screen test some
looks that will appeal to her demographic.

25:07.826 --> 25:10.786
And then I want us to bang out some copy

25:10.787 --> 25:14.165
so that we can talk about what segments
that we will be giving to Bradley.

25:14.166 --> 25:16.083
What time does Ashley Brown get here?

25:16.084 --> 25:17.585
- Around 10:00.
- 10:00. Okay, great.

25:17.586 --> 25:19.462
I'll do her pre-interview then.

25:19.463 --> 25:22.340
Sorry, should I know who Ashley Brown is?

25:22.341 --> 25:23.549
Mitch's victim.

25:23.550 --> 25:25.134
No, let's not call her a victim.

25:25.135 --> 25:27.011
Okay, what should we call her then?

25:27.012 --> 25:30.223
I think "accuser" feels more appropriate.

25:30.224 --> 25:33.768
Look, if she wants to call herself
a victim, we can take our lead from her.

25:33.769 --> 25:36.896
But I think it's important
that she feels in control of it.

25:36.897 --> 25:38.773
In control of the language used.

25:38.774 --> 25:44.278
So, just to be clear,
and I appreciate the typed-up schedule,

25:44.279 --> 25:48.866
you're doing the Ashley Brown interview?

25:48.867 --> 25:54.664
Yes, I am, Chip.

25:54.665 --> 25:57.041
What?

25:57.042 --> 26:00.378
Okay. All right, team.

26:00.379 --> 26:06.050
I will address the elephant in the room.

26:06.051 --> 26:10.555
Yes, yes. I worked side by side with Mitch
for 15 years.

26:10.556 --> 26:12.848
God knows he was not perfect.

26:12.849 --> 26:15.810
I felt it daily.

26:15.811 --> 26:19.063
But I didn't know he was that guy.

26:19.064 --> 26:21.816
And that's a problem.

26:21.817 --> 26:24.777
I fell asleep at the wheel.

26:24.778 --> 26:28.447
But I want you to know that I am here now.

26:28.448 --> 26:30.825
And I'm here for Ashley,

26:30.826 --> 26:32.618
and I'm here for you.

26:32.619 --> 26:38.916
I'm available, I'm accessible,
and I'm awake.

26:38.917 --> 26:45.089
So, shall we?

26:45.090 --> 26:50.219
Stay on two. As we said, go with Yanko.
Go with Yanko.

26:50.220 --> 26:52.680
If you live in New England, not so fast.

26:52.681 --> 26:55.349
You'll be seeing one last snowfall
of the season.

26:55.350 --> 26:58.978
We do have some exciting wind blowing
our way down here in New York City too,

26:58.979 --> 27:02.190
and she goes by the name
of Bradley Jackson.

27:02.191 --> 27:03.774
- See what I did there?
- Very smooth.

27:03.775 --> 27:05.276
Welcome to command center.

27:05.277 --> 27:10.489
I may be stating the obvious, but it's
a pretty exciting weekend here at TMS.

27:10.490 --> 27:12.992
We have our new Morning Show cohost,
Bradley, in the halls,

27:12.993 --> 27:16.871
and she and Alex are prepping a really,
really amazing show for this Monday.

27:16.872 --> 27:18.080
That's right, Daniel.

27:18.081 --> 27:21.918
And that includes an interview with our
very own former colleague Ashley Brown,

27:21.919 --> 27:26.589
who has bravely agreed to return and talk
about her experience with Mitch Kessler.

27:26.590 --> 27:27.840
That's going to be something.

27:27.841 --> 27:30.051
- Yeah. It's very, very brave.
- Yeah. Big stuff.

27:30.052 --> 27:32.428
We hope you spend
your Monday morning with our new family.

27:32.429 --> 27:33.512
I'm Daniel Henderson.

27:33.513 --> 27:34.597
I'm Alison Namazi.

27:34.598 --> 27:35.723
I'm Yanko Flores.

27:35.724 --> 27:38.059
And this was the weekend edition
of The Morning Show.

27:38.060 --> 27:39.977
- Ready, four?
- Until next time.

27:39.978 --> 27:45.566
Take four. Insert. Roll credits.

27:45.567 --> 27:48.736
'Cause America loves a good Cinderella
story, just as long as she's a white girl.

27:48.737 --> 27:52.240
Please. Disney got you a black princess,
like, what, 2008?

27:52.241 --> 27:53.324
He's not wrong.

27:53.325 --> 27:56.160
- I don't recall that.
- You didn't see it. There was a frog.

27:56.161 --> 27:58.746
Bradley. Hi. Claire. We met the other day.

27:58.747 --> 28:00.831
- Yeah, yeah. I remember.
- I'm with the digital team today.

28:00.832 --> 28:03.876
If it's cool, I'm gonna shadow you
while we do your screen tests.

28:03.877 --> 28:08.548
Give people a front-row look
on how we make a star.

28:08.549 --> 28:11.509
Sorry, they told me to say that.
Stupid. Let's go.

28:11.510 --> 28:12.593
Okay.

28:12.594 --> 28:16.305
Fuck me.

28:16.306 --> 28:21.477
Tell me why
I shouldn't hand in my resignation now.

28:21.478 --> 28:23.187
Daniel, I could write you a fucking book.

28:23.188 --> 28:25.898
Yesterday,
you said it was my chair to lose.

28:25.899 --> 28:28.150
And I don't recall fucking up the pass.

28:28.151 --> 28:32.113
So why am I out there previewing
a conservative beauty queen?

28:32.114 --> 28:35.199
You know, she's not a beauty queen,
and she's actually more of a libertarian,

28:35.200 --> 28:36.284
so I don't know.

28:36.285 --> 28:38.703
- Chip, I'm out.
- Daniel, come on. Hold on.

28:38.704 --> 28:40.580
Take a breath, take a breath,
take a breath.

28:40.581 --> 28:43.332
I have been told to take deep breaths
my whole life.

28:43.333 --> 28:45.001
I can't do it anymore.

28:45.002 --> 28:46.168
Daniel, I'm telling you,

28:46.169 --> 28:49.255
you walk out that door, you're never
gonna get back in when the chair opens up.

28:49.256 --> 28:50.381
And when will that be?

28:50.382 --> 28:51.924
Because women live longer than men,

28:51.925 --> 28:54.594
and those two
look like they do a lot of Pilates.

28:54.595 --> 28:57.346
Read the tea leaves!
Bradley Jackson is a nobody.

28:57.347 --> 29:00.683
Alex is... clearly struggling, you know?

29:00.684 --> 29:04.812
It was a desperate move from someone
who had their fucking ego bruised, okay?

29:04.813 --> 29:07.023
This will fail.

29:07.024 --> 29:12.320
And, when it does,
maybe two chairs are gonna open up.

29:12.321 --> 29:18.242
Okay? So, please, I'm begging you,

29:18.243 --> 29:20.661
ride with me through this shitstorm,

29:20.662 --> 29:33.373
and I promise you
the show will be yours in the end.

29:37.512 --> 29:42.475
Here we go.

29:42.476 --> 29:47.313
Yeah!

29:47.314 --> 29:48.397
Here's the thing.

29:48.398 --> 29:51.734
Everything can be recontextualized.

29:51.735 --> 29:54.237
They take my movies that I directed,

29:54.238 --> 29:57.823
and they pervert them
to fit a convenient narrative.

29:57.824 --> 29:59.825
Hugging and Loving, right?

29:59.826 --> 30:00.993
That's a veiled portrait

30:00.994 --> 30:03.454
of my grandmother's assimilation story,
for God's sake.

30:03.455 --> 30:05.957
That is a terrific film.
That's my mom's favorite film.

30:05.958 --> 30:11.462
So, now, it's about what I apparently did
to all my leading ladies.

30:11.463 --> 30:13.339
Well, when did hugging become a sin?

30:13.340 --> 30:15.216
Fuck it. I love to hug.

30:15.217 --> 30:16.759
Huggings are nice.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.929
Yeah. Jeez. That is crazy.

30:19.930 --> 30:25.101
No, no, no. Crazy is how they loved
the title Jessica Over Easy

30:25.102 --> 30:28.104
and then, of course, now they just
rip me to shreds over it.

30:28.105 --> 30:31.399
God damn it. You know what?
They just twist everything.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.986
I don't even understand
what their message is they're sending out.

30:34.987 --> 30:38.239
That women are not allowed to be
in possession of their sexual choices?

30:38.240 --> 30:40.324
When they fixate on us,
they lose sight of the issues.

30:40.325 --> 30:41.951
I actually feel bad for the kids.

30:41.952 --> 30:45.663
'Cause there's nothing sexy about consent.

30:45.664 --> 30:46.831
Well...

30:46.832 --> 30:51.544
That came out wrong, and that was creepy.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.629
I guess what I'm saying is...

30:53.630 --> 30:56.465
humanity happens in the unspoken moments,

30:56.466 --> 31:01.387
and I just feel badly for a generation
that loses that.

31:01.388 --> 31:05.474
Wow. That's really well said.

31:05.475 --> 31:06.851
Fuck it.

31:06.852 --> 31:08.436
Fuck it.

31:08.437 --> 31:10.605
We're not in prison.

31:10.606 --> 31:13.274
Prison of public opinion.

31:13.275 --> 31:15.902
That's exactly what I wanna talk about.

31:15.903 --> 31:19.363
The discussion, this whole Me Too thing,

31:19.364 --> 31:22.533
it is so fucking puritanical and myopic.

31:22.534 --> 31:23.743
No one is addressing it.

31:23.744 --> 31:27.455
A woman can say one thing about you.

31:27.456 --> 31:29.540
It doesn't matter what her motivation is.

31:29.541 --> 31:32.460
And everything you've done in your life...
gone.

31:32.461 --> 31:35.213
Your career erased.

31:35.214 --> 31:37.548
You deserve better, buddy.

31:37.549 --> 31:40.843
You deserve better.

31:40.844 --> 31:43.512
I have an idea.

31:43.513 --> 31:46.891
We do a documentary.
You direct it. I do the interviews.

31:46.892 --> 31:49.810
We make them look at it.
We make them look at us.

31:49.811 --> 31:52.730
We ask to be a part of the conversation.

31:52.731 --> 31:55.024
I mean...

31:55.025 --> 31:57.235
we did something wrong, okay.

31:57.236 --> 31:58.319
What?

31:58.320 --> 32:00.029
If that's the way you feel, fine,

32:00.030 --> 32:02.323
but explain it to me,
'cause I don't fucking get it.

32:02.324 --> 32:04.242
A conversation with the victims.

32:04.243 --> 32:07.078
Yes. And I think we can do it
in a really smart way.

32:07.079 --> 32:09.330
I don't think we refer to them as victims.

32:09.331 --> 32:11.207
I think...

32:11.208 --> 32:14.043
that's a concess... I don't think
it's something we want to concede.

32:14.044 --> 32:16.170
No, no, we do call them victims,

32:16.171 --> 32:18.297
and then we prove why they're not.

32:18.298 --> 32:22.176
I'm not sure that we should use gotcha
journalism with the women who accused us.

32:22.177 --> 32:24.845
Oh, fuck that! Jesus. They did it with us.

32:24.846 --> 32:26.681
"Gotcha!

32:26.682 --> 32:29.100
I'll fuck you for the role,
and then I'll win an Oscar."

32:29.101 --> 32:31.811
And then, "Oh, now I'm 50 and irrelevant,

32:31.812 --> 32:34.939
so I'll scream 'rape'
and then I'll force a settlement."

32:34.940 --> 32:37.859
You know,
as if that lazy lay deserves a cent.

32:37.860 --> 32:41.404
No, no, you're wrong.

32:41.405 --> 32:42.697
Wow. Is that real?

32:42.698 --> 32:43.948
"Gotcha!

32:43.949 --> 32:46.742
I said I was 20. I was only 15."

32:46.743 --> 32:49.871
Bullshit. "Then why do you look
like a tired old bag?"

32:49.872 --> 32:57.837
And yeah, I'd love...
I'd kill to see her birth certificate.

32:57.838 --> 32:59.463
How come I never heard about that one?

32:59.464 --> 33:01.716
'Cause she's going the legal route.

33:01.717 --> 33:03.926
Big fucking chance.

33:03.927 --> 33:05.678
Statute of limitations, babe.

33:05.679 --> 33:09.599
You know, sometimes you gotta say,
"God bless America."

33:09.600 --> 33:12.685
Finally protected.

33:12.686 --> 33:15.563
Yeah, well,

33:15.564 --> 33:18.566
maybe we should just interview the men,

33:18.567 --> 33:23.404
because it might be naive to think
that the women would want to participate.

33:23.405 --> 33:25.573
Do you think we could get Cosby?

33:25.574 --> 33:28.534
No, let's... No.

33:28.535 --> 33:33.664
No. I think another smart idea would be

33:33.665 --> 33:38.336
to talk about the specificity
of the Me Too movements.

33:38.337 --> 33:44.342
There was the first wave of guys
who were accused,

33:44.343 --> 33:46.469
and then there was a second wave,

33:46.470 --> 33:50.556
and we could talk about the nuance
between the two.

33:50.557 --> 33:51.724
I don't think I follow.

33:51.725 --> 33:57.438
Well, the first wave was... really bad.

33:57.439 --> 34:01.108
And then the guys accused
in the second wave was just different,

34:01.109 --> 34:10.117
and I don't think
we should be scared to talk about it.

34:10.118 --> 34:21.170
Spell it out for me, won't you, Mitch?

34:21.171 --> 34:25.007
Well, you are actually a predator.

34:25.008 --> 34:37.052
And people are gonna want you to own that.

34:38.272 --> 34:42.316
As opposed to...

34:42.317 --> 34:49.115
What are you exactly, Mitch?

34:49.116 --> 34:52.869
Not you.

34:52.870 --> 34:55.329
The organization has now raised
over $80,000

34:55.330 --> 34:57.790
to help end sexual assault
on college campuses.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.250
Pace it down. You have time.

34:59.251 --> 35:00.334
Okay.

35:00.335 --> 35:02.587
And educate students on consent.

35:02.588 --> 35:04.463
Really inspiring to see these young women

35:04.464 --> 35:07.174
working together to effect change,
isn't it, Alex?

35:07.175 --> 35:09.343
Fast learner, our Bradley.

35:09.344 --> 35:11.888
Well, it's Saturday night,
and she has the stage to herself.

35:11.889 --> 35:13.764
Let's not do the hora just yet.

35:13.765 --> 35:16.517
Coming up after the break,
we have one of my personal favorites,

35:16.518 --> 35:18.978
The Pioneer Woman, Ree Drummond.

35:18.979 --> 35:23.774
Alex, growing up on the farm, my mama made
the best grits in all of West Virginia.

35:23.775 --> 35:25.276
Let's see how Ree compares.

35:25.277 --> 35:26.943
Seriously, you guys? This is garbage.

35:26.944 --> 35:32.158
I don't call my mother "Mama,"
and she's also a terrible cook.

35:32.159 --> 35:33.325
I hear you, Bradley.

35:33.326 --> 35:34.492
Do you?

35:34.493 --> 35:36.746
Yeah. We're taking notes.
We're making changes.

35:36.747 --> 35:38.497
How about I do it for you?

35:38.498 --> 35:40.333
Please welcome The Pioneer Woman,

35:40.334 --> 35:42.751
who somehow manages to idealize an era

35:42.752 --> 35:45.338
when women birthed babies
in covered wagons

35:45.339 --> 35:49.383
and died from cholera before
they even had a chance to nurse 'em.

35:49.384 --> 35:53.679
Something like that?

35:53.680 --> 35:57.892
Yo, Jackson. God here.
Let's fix that wardrobe.

35:57.893 --> 36:01.354
Whoever's picking these outfits
should be fired.

36:01.355 --> 36:10.530
Alex picked 'em.

36:10.531 --> 36:12.532
All right, next up,

36:12.533 --> 36:17.620
Lizzy has her mock trial semifinal
on May 3.

36:17.621 --> 36:19.914
Yeah, it's an all-day thing.
I'll cover it.

36:19.915 --> 36:21.499
No. I wanna go to that.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.084
Yeah, it's at Wolcott's.

36:23.085 --> 36:28.506
I refuse to have boarding school mean
that I don't get to see my fucking kid.

36:28.507 --> 36:30.550
I'm gonna get more wine.
Would you like some?

36:30.551 --> 36:32.426
Sure. Why don't you switch to white?

36:32.427 --> 36:33.886
Isn't that stuff giving you headaches?

36:33.887 --> 36:36.097
If I don't take an Advil, okay, Jason?

36:36.098 --> 36:37.765
- Jesus.
- Okay. Jesus Christ.

36:37.766 --> 36:38.975
God.

36:38.976 --> 36:40.226
- Al, Al, Al.
- What?

36:40.227 --> 36:42.478
Oh, God. What is going on?

36:42.479 --> 36:46.148
I just think it's weird that we have to
make a fake family calendar. That's all.

36:46.149 --> 36:47.441
We've always done it.

36:47.442 --> 36:52.655
No, but now it just is...
feels like a game.

36:52.656 --> 36:53.865
Lizzy's stuff is real,

36:53.866 --> 36:58.703
but coordinating my events and you having
to pretend. Come on. It feels weird.

36:58.704 --> 37:01.789
Yes, obviously. It's fucking bizarre.

37:01.790 --> 37:03.624
But, you know, we'll figure it out.

37:03.625 --> 37:06.419
Lizzy's at boarding school now.
She'll be at college in a minute.

37:06.420 --> 37:09.046
Yes, I know. I know.
And I'm thrilled for her.

37:09.047 --> 37:11.507
We raised a beautiful, independent kid,

37:11.508 --> 37:14.719
but would it kill her
to need us a little bit more?

37:14.720 --> 37:16.846
Oh, come on.

37:16.847 --> 37:23.060
Is that really what's bothering you?

37:23.061 --> 37:28.149
Come on.

37:28.150 --> 37:30.818
Page Six thinks I'm crazy.

37:30.819 --> 37:34.572
Page Six thought you were pregnant
ten times last year. Who cares?

37:34.573 --> 37:36.824
Well, I very well might be.

37:36.825 --> 37:38.743
- Excuse me?
- Crazy, not pregnant.

37:38.744 --> 37:42.705
Crazy. I'm...
This article came up the other day.

37:42.706 --> 37:48.294
I googled "Alex and Bradley" 'cause...
I'm fucking human and curious,

37:48.295 --> 37:49.837
and this article popped up

37:49.838 --> 37:54.884
that said I was "wandering the halls
of TMS in the middle of the night."

37:54.885 --> 37:56.302
Were you?

37:56.303 --> 37:58.179
Yes.

37:58.180 --> 38:03.809
But that means that my coworkers
are leaking stories about me.

38:03.810 --> 38:05.102
Mitch is going down,

38:05.103 --> 38:08.397
and somehow stories about me
being crazy are popping up.

38:08.398 --> 38:10.399
How the fuck does that track?

38:10.400 --> 38:12.902
- All right, it's a big change.
- Yes.

38:12.903 --> 38:14.570
You're allowed to feel it.

38:14.571 --> 38:16.739
I know, but I'm the one
who made this big, stupid

38:16.740 --> 38:20.535
Bradley-Jackson,
whoever-the-fuck-that-is move.

38:20.536 --> 38:23.704
I mean, it is crazy.
It's absolutely crazy.

38:23.705 --> 38:26.832
But at first it felt like "I'm in control.
This is a power move."

38:26.833 --> 38:31.003
But I just... This stupid shitshow,
I'm just... I'm exhausted.

38:31.004 --> 38:35.258
I'm just so exhausted.

38:35.259 --> 38:37.969
Would it really be so bad
if it all went away?

38:37.970 --> 38:39.053
What?

38:39.054 --> 38:42.515
Oh, come on. A part of you
is trying to blow it all up. Admit it.

38:42.516 --> 38:45.351
Now, come on. I know you.

38:45.352 --> 38:47.228
I get it.

38:47.229 --> 38:51.566
But you've had this
unbelievable run, Alex.

38:51.567 --> 38:54.235
You've earned your freedom.

38:54.236 --> 38:58.239
You've earned your family their freedom.

38:58.240 --> 39:03.578
So, I don't know, maybe this is the moment
you get to choose to stop.

39:03.579 --> 39:07.081
We'll be fine.

39:07.082 --> 39:10.167
Wait. Are you saying that if I quit,
we would be...

39:10.168 --> 39:14.881
Fuck, no, no, I'm...
No, I was not making this about me. Sorry.

39:14.882 --> 39:17.466
Okay.

39:17.467 --> 39:19.969
Thank you for that.

39:19.970 --> 39:31.638
- Thank you.
- Sure.

39:40.824 --> 39:43.659
Am I supposed to be impressed
you can open Barneys?

39:43.660 --> 39:46.621
You're supposed to be impressed
that I've got $30,000

39:46.622 --> 39:55.838
for you to spend on whatever you want.

39:55.839 --> 39:58.007
Do you have a favorite silhouette?

39:58.008 --> 40:00.927
Pants.

40:00.928 --> 40:05.473
Pencil, cigarette, flared,
high-waisted, gaucho, drop-crotch...

40:05.474 --> 40:08.434
You know what? Just bring us a variety.
We trust you.

40:08.435 --> 40:10.603
And throw in some dresses too, please.

40:10.604 --> 40:15.024
I get you're not a typical woman, but
try to see the joy in a wardrobe upgrade.

40:15.025 --> 40:18.152
What is a typical woman?

40:18.153 --> 40:21.155
You know, not everything is a challenge.

40:21.156 --> 40:25.076
People usually say that
when they don't wanna be challenged.

40:25.077 --> 40:26.786
Wow. You're fun.

40:26.787 --> 40:27.870
I'm tired.

40:27.871 --> 40:32.959
And I don't feel like pretending
Pretty Woman is my favorite movie.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.877
What is your favorite movie?

40:34.878 --> 40:37.255
What do you want my favorite movie to be?

40:37.256 --> 40:39.674
I'm beginning to sense
that you're very frustrated.

40:39.675 --> 40:41.384
Look, I don't wanna sound ungrateful.

40:41.385 --> 40:44.053
New clothes are fun. They're...

40:44.054 --> 40:45.513
You know what's even more fun?

40:45.514 --> 40:48.516
Having your image
workshopped by a focus group.

40:48.517 --> 40:51.686
I can't wait to hear
how I'm gonna alienate Americans.

40:51.687 --> 40:55.731
I've been contending with the misogynistic
world of journalism for 15 years.

40:55.732 --> 40:58.067
I've only been told
about a thousand different ways

40:58.068 --> 41:01.153
I'm too liberal,
too conservative, too in-between.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.823
"You've too much chin.
You're not smiling enough.

41:03.824 --> 41:06.117
You're too brunette.
Do you wanna go blonde?

41:06.118 --> 41:07.201
Where are your boobs?

41:07.202 --> 41:09.537
Quick, put your boobs out.
Wait, put your boobs away.

41:09.538 --> 41:11.998
You're attracting men.
You're scaring women.

41:11.999 --> 41:14.876
Try not to be so confrontational.
Men don't wanna fuck you.

41:14.877 --> 41:16.919
Don't be so angry. Women feel criticized."

41:16.920 --> 41:18.170
But here, no, no,

41:18.171 --> 41:22.592
here I'm gonna transform into
the aspirational, inoffensive dream girl.

41:22.593 --> 41:25.553
Here I'm gonna become
the Mother Teresa of the morning news.

41:25.554 --> 41:29.223
Though I'm pretty sure that Mother Teresa
had too many fucking wrinkles for HD.

41:29.224 --> 41:34.645
All right, are we doing this? Let's go.

41:34.646 --> 41:38.649
I'm trying on a lot of clothes
for someone without a signed contract.

41:38.650 --> 41:41.319
It'll be ready tomorrow.
You need a better agent.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.154
My agent is fine.

41:43.155 --> 41:48.701
He's an idiot if he closes at $700,000.

41:48.702 --> 41:51.370
I thought you were trying
to get me on the cheap.

41:51.371 --> 41:58.294
I don't mind paying someone
what I think they're worth.

41:58.295 --> 42:00.963
You're single, right?

42:00.964 --> 42:02.131
Single.

42:02.132 --> 42:04.800
What's that got to do with my contract?

42:04.801 --> 42:08.429
So, you are? That's great.

42:08.430 --> 42:09.597
Good. Keep it that way.

42:09.598 --> 42:12.808
American women, they're getting married
later, often not at all.

42:12.809 --> 42:15.520
Eggs frozen to be used another day,
if at all.

42:15.521 --> 42:17.688
Men to be fucked
but not needed for fulfillment.

42:17.689 --> 42:23.402
That's exciting, that's reality,
and that is not on morning television.

42:23.403 --> 42:25.821
Okay. What do you think of this?

42:25.822 --> 42:29.158
Oh, yeah. Right.

42:29.159 --> 42:31.953
Very Pantsuit Nation.

42:31.954 --> 42:34.121
Fuck off.

42:34.122 --> 42:36.165
No, I love it.

42:36.166 --> 42:40.711
I'm serious. It just, it...
It reminds me of my mom.

42:40.712 --> 42:41.796
Seriously?

42:41.797 --> 42:43.339
My mom is awesome,

42:43.340 --> 42:46.300
and she is gonna love you.

42:46.301 --> 42:51.639
Martha has never seen herself reflected
on The Morning Show.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.141
Is this the mom you took care of
after Daddy left?

42:54.142 --> 42:59.272
Oh, I see. You think of her as, like,
a sad, weak, abandoned woman?

42:59.273 --> 43:01.357
Hey, I didn't say that.

43:01.358 --> 43:05.653
I took care of my mom, in the cooking
her dinner and giving her hugs sense.

43:05.654 --> 43:07.613
Telling her to put her work away
and go to bed.

43:07.614 --> 43:12.535
And I was, you know,
a terrific 12-year-old mom to my mom.

43:12.536 --> 43:13.953
What does she do?

43:13.954 --> 43:15.621
Retired now.

43:15.622 --> 43:19.876
She was a campaign organizer
for progressive women who usually lost.

43:19.877 --> 43:22.211
Martha loved a easy sell.

43:22.212 --> 43:24.463
Like mother, like son.

43:24.464 --> 43:25.548
How so?

43:25.549 --> 43:28.676
Peddling out to America a 40-year-old,
single, childless woman

43:28.677 --> 43:29.927
who's a political independent?

43:29.928 --> 43:32.763
I don't think you're a tough sell.

43:32.764 --> 43:36.475
We already have the housewives
watching TMS.

43:36.476 --> 43:40.605
If we want to win the ratings war,
we need the women who aren't watching,

43:40.606 --> 43:44.400
the ones that don't see themselves
reflected in Ice Queen Alex.

43:44.401 --> 43:47.778
So... be messy.

43:47.779 --> 43:51.782
Let's do segments
on the ways that you haven't "lived up."

43:51.783 --> 44:05.704
Be the narrative real women are living.

45:06.024 --> 45:09.110
There is no way that Ashley
is only one fucking segment.

45:09.111 --> 45:11.654
That's plenty of time
for a good interview.

45:11.655 --> 45:15.783
It is completely disrespectful
to the seriousness of the subject.

45:15.784 --> 45:19.161
I get it. But Ashley is not good.

45:19.162 --> 45:21.289
Oh, my Go... Okay, hold on a second.

45:21.290 --> 45:23.875
Did you seriously just call her
"not a good victim"?

45:23.876 --> 45:25.418
Look, I read the transcript.

45:25.419 --> 45:27.837
She's superficial, she's inconsistent
in her recounting of the story...

45:27.838 --> 45:31.048
She's completely preoccupied by Mitch,
how he might feel about it.

45:31.049 --> 45:32.633
Okay, so did you bring her in for backup?

45:32.634 --> 45:34.760
- Is that what Mia's doing here?
- I am nobody's backup.

45:34.761 --> 45:36.220
I read the transcript
from your pre-interview.

45:36.221 --> 45:38.514
- I came to my own conclusions.
- Why are you reading my transcripts?

45:38.515 --> 45:40.057
Hey, hey, hey.

45:40.058 --> 45:42.768
Mia's in charge of our Me Too coverage.
She gets what works.

45:42.769 --> 45:44.645
This is not about Me Too, Chip.

45:44.646 --> 45:46.939
This is about us. This is about our show,

45:46.940 --> 45:48.774
how we will be judged by the public.

45:48.775 --> 45:52.278
And if you cut that down, it's gonna look
like a dodge. It just fucking is.

45:52.279 --> 45:54.655
So get this
into your little fucking brains, okay?

45:54.656 --> 45:57.325
I'm doing the interview my way,
and if you have a problem with it,

45:57.326 --> 46:05.750
and if you have a problem with it,
then fucking quit.

46:05.751 --> 46:18.012
Just let her deal with it.
Fuck it. Fuck it.

46:18.013 --> 46:26.562
I'll be on stage in a minute!

46:26.563 --> 46:31.692
You shouldn't do the interview
with Ashley.

46:31.693 --> 46:34.529
Why wouldn't I?

46:34.530 --> 46:36.447
I don't know.

46:36.448 --> 46:40.409
Seems like you wanna create this narrative
about how you're taking control,

46:40.410 --> 46:44.288
how you've been powerless, but...

46:44.289 --> 46:47.416
that's pretty convenient.

46:47.417 --> 46:49.377
What's convenient about it?

46:49.378 --> 46:51.087
You've always had power,

46:51.088 --> 46:56.676
and you know exactly what it looks like
when a woman doesn't.

46:56.677 --> 47:02.974
Mia, I don't think
we've ever known each other that well.

47:02.975 --> 47:04.475
Maybe not,

47:04.476 --> 47:07.520
but it hasn't stopped you
from making assumptions about me.

47:07.521 --> 47:11.607
Yeah. I've made assumptions
about you and Mitch.

47:11.608 --> 47:14.318
I did not approve of that relationship.

47:14.319 --> 47:16.571
Not one bit.

47:16.572 --> 47:19.282
Completely inappropriate.

47:19.283 --> 47:21.576
And I think the world is making that
pretty clear right now.

47:21.577 --> 47:23.703
But what I don't understand
is why is this my fault?

47:23.704 --> 47:24.787
It's not.

47:24.788 --> 47:27.874
But you're not impartial on this subject.
You knew what Mitch was doing.

47:27.875 --> 47:30.459
And you're impartial?

47:30.460 --> 47:32.837
You're producing the person
who'll be doing the interview.

47:32.838 --> 47:35.131
- That's pretty fuckin' transparent.
- This isn't about that.

47:35.132 --> 47:37.884
Well, then what is it about, Mia?
'Cause I'm getting really confused.

47:37.885 --> 47:41.220
I don't ever remember you
confiding in me about Mitch,

47:41.221 --> 47:42.930
asking me for help.

47:42.931 --> 47:51.314
I remember you being pretty capable
of taking good care of yourself.

47:51.315 --> 47:53.191
Do whatever you wanna do with Ashley,

47:53.192 --> 47:55.735
but I'm telling you,
she's enamored of you.

47:55.736 --> 48:00.114
You'll never get to something honest.

48:00.115 --> 48:12.159
And then
you're gonna get crucified for it.

48:16.465 --> 48:21.844
God.

48:21.845 --> 48:23.888
So, one big happy family.

48:23.889 --> 48:25.765
Yeah. With an absent mother.

48:25.766 --> 48:28.142
I, honestly, was shocked
that she agreed to a run-through.

48:28.143 --> 48:30.102
Not exactly a team player?

48:30.103 --> 48:33.189
Alex requires
a fair amount of personal space.

48:33.190 --> 48:34.982
It's just who she is.

48:34.983 --> 48:36.943
Okay, so, Alex is in a meeting.

48:36.944 --> 48:39.654
We're gonna mark some transitions
without her.

48:39.655 --> 48:45.493
Daniel,
do you mind playing Alex for a bit?

48:45.494 --> 48:52.083
- Don't mind at all.
- Okay.

48:52.084 --> 48:54.126
This way.

48:54.127 --> 48:55.211
Okay.

48:55.212 --> 48:56.420
Speaking of family,

48:56.421 --> 48:59.507
we know how hard it is to make
your kid's lunch quick and healthy,

48:59.508 --> 49:02.552
but luckily, multitasking mom Margaret M...

49:02.553 --> 49:05.429
multitasking mom Margaret Mapel...

49:05.430 --> 49:09.934
Okay. Can we run that back?
That's a lot of alliteration.

49:09.935 --> 49:13.020
- I'm not looking for sympathy.
- I'm not offering any.

49:13.021 --> 49:15.481
All right. Going again,
let's take it from the top.

49:15.482 --> 49:17.608
Here we go.
Starting with Bradley's line.

49:17.609 --> 49:19.068
Everyone quiet, please.

49:19.069 --> 49:20.820
You're doing great.
Just take a deep breath.

49:20.821 --> 49:22.905
Mia, thanks for showing up.

49:22.906 --> 49:25.825
Sorry. Dealing with some changes.

49:25.826 --> 49:28.619
You are doing the interview with Ashley.

49:28.620 --> 49:31.289
We've pushed it to the end of the week
so we can prepare.

49:31.290 --> 49:34.208
Wait, what?

49:34.209 --> 49:37.336
Yeah. Alex just told me on her way out.

49:37.337 --> 49:38.921
On her way out?

49:38.922 --> 49:40.756
What, she's leaving?

49:40.757 --> 49:41.841
Yeah.

49:41.842 --> 49:45.970
Wait, when is she gonna rehearse
with me? On air?

49:45.971 --> 49:48.639
Bradley, this run-through is going well.
Just push through.

49:48.640 --> 49:51.267
Oh, hell no! No, no, no.

49:51.268 --> 49:53.644
I'm not going on tomorrow
if we don't rehearse.

49:53.645 --> 49:57.315
Bra... Hey!
Don't let her walk out of this...

49:57.316 --> 49:59.650
Great.

49:59.651 --> 50:01.986
Great.

50:01.987 --> 50:06.115
Hey! Alex!

50:06.116 --> 50:11.204
Hey! Alex. Alex.

50:11.205 --> 50:13.247
Why are you not going through
the run-through?

50:13.248 --> 50:15.333
We moved the Ashley interview
to the end of the week,

50:15.334 --> 50:16.918
so I gotta go home and prep a new story.

50:16.919 --> 50:19.462
Why are you giving me the interview?

50:19.463 --> 50:21.297
Because it's better for the show.

50:21.298 --> 50:23.216
Why are you doing this to me?

50:23.217 --> 50:25.801
Doing what?
Handing you an amazing opportunity?

50:25.802 --> 50:27.220
No. You're making no sense.

50:27.221 --> 50:29.138
You're not being present.

50:29.139 --> 50:30.431
What the fuck?

50:30.432 --> 50:32.141
I don't have all the answers.

50:32.142 --> 50:33.851
And why does this have to be about you?

50:33.852 --> 50:36.354
'Cause I'm a woman who has a life.
You realize that?

50:36.355 --> 50:38.731
I have people I'm responsible for,

50:38.732 --> 50:41.859
and I have career aspirations
that don't involve being your sidekick.

50:41.860 --> 50:46.280
You are not my sidekick. You're my cohost.

50:46.281 --> 50:51.327
Well, you have barely acknowledged me
all weekend.

50:51.328 --> 50:55.498
I didn't know that you needed me
to hold your hand.

50:55.499 --> 50:57.625
I need a partner.

50:57.626 --> 51:04.423
Sometimes partners hold hands.

51:04.424 --> 51:06.926
Oh, Jesus.

51:06.927 --> 51:08.970
Okay.

51:08.971 --> 51:11.472
Bradley...

51:11.473 --> 51:16.769
I don't have a fucking clue
what I'm doing.

51:16.770 --> 51:19.856
- You don't?
- Nope. Not a clue.

51:19.857 --> 51:21.899
Running on instinct.

51:21.900 --> 51:23.317
But I know that I need a second

51:23.318 --> 51:27.738
so I can get my shit together
to go on air tomorrow.

51:27.739 --> 51:31.117
And I know I have to not be in that
building with those fucking people

51:31.118 --> 51:37.665
who are constantly judging my choices.

51:37.666 --> 51:41.210
I honestly don't know why I picked you.

51:41.211 --> 51:44.422
Okay? That's the truth.

51:44.423 --> 51:48.426
Just an impulse, and I went with it.

51:48.427 --> 51:56.017
But I do know that I think I like you.

51:56.018 --> 52:00.521
Just go sign your contract.

52:00.522 --> 52:02.356
All right.

52:02.357 --> 52:05.568
Okay.

52:05.569 --> 52:16.862
Watch your step.

53:33.198 --> 53:40.969
Don't fuck it up.

53:40.971 --> 53:45.971
