02:06.877 --> 02:09.922
You ever wonder
why they call it that? El Niño.

02:11.340 --> 02:15.886
It starts with something so small
AND SO INSIGNIFICANT: An anchovy.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.348
See, the anchovy,
it prospers most in temperate waters.

02:19.431 --> 02:23.310
So when equatorial trade winds,
when they brought cold water westward,

02:23.393 --> 02:26.647
it slowly broiled under the beating sun.

02:26.730 --> 02:31.068
And by the time it reached Chimbote, Peru,
which is the anchovy capital of the world,

02:31.151 --> 02:35.364
the warming waters were completely
uninhabitable for the anchovy.

02:35.447 --> 02:36.740
That's so sad.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.284
Oh, no. Gets worse.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.494
The economy suffered.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.746
I mean, everything suffered,
not just the fish.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.749
The aquatic seabirds
that fed on the anchovies,

02:45.832 --> 02:49.586
from the gannets to the cormorants
to the pelicans, they all died.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.672
And then so did
the animals that fed on them.

02:52.381 --> 02:56.802
And because this phenomenon would,
without fail,

02:56.885 --> 03:00.264
coincide with the celebration
of the birth of Christ,

03:00.347 --> 03:04.434
they called it El Niño de Navidad.
"The Christmas Boy."

03:06.311 --> 03:09.022
Come on. [LAUGHS]
You got to hand it to the Peruvians.

03:09.106 --> 03:15.112
I mean, something so destructive in such
harmless packaging. "El Niño de Navidad."

03:15.195 --> 03:18.365
I mean, this thing
that seems so insignificant,

03:18.448 --> 03:22.953
winds that make the water too hot
for this tiny little fish to live, but no.

03:23.370 --> 03:27.916
It's a harbinger of something
that throws everything out of whack.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.962
I mean, droughts, floods, storms.
I mean, huge global events.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.632
But there's nothing you can do
to stop the wind from blowing.

03:36.508 --> 03:40.929
So what can you do when you see all these
little anchovies belly up in the water?

Look, we know that he knew,
but we're talking about proof here, okay?

[STAMMERS] No, not explicitly.

I mean, look, Fred, he pushed me
to promote her and to fucking fire Jared,

05:24.283 --> 05:26.203
which I thought was a little odd,
but I didn't...

05:26.285 --> 05:28.787
Didn't want to question it
'cause that's hard to do, right?

05:28.871 --> 05:30.539
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Mitch?

05:30.622 --> 05:32.892

pretty clearly right now.

or that I'm the one who's doing it?

was doing a piece on it.

I'll never work again.

[CORY] Chip is right about this.
This has to happen as soon as possible.

in this room right now

plan to take over the airwaves

during its most profitable show.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.596
And you did tell Alex
that you met with Mitch,

07:02.631 --> 07:04.150
- I know.
- So she knows and she isn't happy.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.426
So with every day that goes by,

07:06.510 --> 07:09.763
the odds that somebody else
is gonna find out about this increase.

07:09.847 --> 07:13.559

or it's not gonna happen at all,

in the gulags for our trouble.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.437

I don't want it to be in the back,

So, I... I'm working on an interview...
with Mitch.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.916
And it's about the culture
at this network that...

15:17.084 --> 15:20.254
allowed his sexual misconduct
to go unaddressed for so long.

is happening on this show?

got my number...

of a sudden is offering me a job in LA.

with Mitch and the aftermath.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.360
When the Vegas shootings happened,

19:54.236 --> 19:57.948
I was at the studio while they started
putting the team together to go cover it.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.701
Chip told me to go.

20:01.577 --> 20:04.705
I was a junior booker at that point.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.625
It was hard.
Tough thing to be in the middle of.

20:09.418 --> 20:15.424

so I went for a walk on the strip.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.052
I ran into Mitch.

He was kind, and he cheered me up.

20:25.601 --> 20:28.562
We walked and talked a while.

20:29.980 --> 20:34.985
It felt very comfortable and familiar.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.656
And it actually distracted me,

20:40.073 --> 20:46.496
'cause I felt really special to be walking
and chatting in public with Mitch Kessler.

21:24.034 --> 21:27.454
We watched the movie for a while.

everything in Vegas...

21:34.545 --> 21:35.921
