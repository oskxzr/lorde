02:01.079 --> 02:02.289
Here's your coffee.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.250
Thanks.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.505
Two more days of being 49.

02:10.589 --> 02:11.840
Enjoy.

02:12.758 --> 02:13.759
Yep.

03:05.686 --> 03:09.565
Paul, Paul, Paul, what are you doing
here in the middle of the fuckin' night?

03:09.648 --> 03:12.150
-I don't know. Just couldn't sleep.
-I get it.

03:13.569 --> 03:16.530
And, hey, happy early birthday
since I won't be seeing you Sunday.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.074
Thank you,
but I'd rather forget about this one.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.250
It's from Alex.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.963
Same stupid song she sends me every year.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.799
Let's do it, boss.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.557
She is such an idiot.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.809
I love this song.

03:48.312 --> 03:52.399
Happy, happy birthday, baby

03:55.736 --> 03:59.406
Although you're with somebody new

04:03.160 --> 04:07.039
Thought I'd drop a line to say

04:07.289 --> 04:10.751
That I wish this happy day

04:10.834 --> 04:15.839
Would find me beside you

04:17.423 --> 04:20.052
And Chip's wondering
if you'll reach out to J.Lo,

04:20.135 --> 04:22.971
see if she's interested in talking
about the situation in Puerto Rico.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.349
-Sure. Of course.
-I'll set that up this evening.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.893
Questions for the education
reform debate Tuesday.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.353
Wait, Tuesday?

04:30.395 --> 04:33.106
That's the same day
as the wild card game. I'm doing that.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.317
Yeah, that's what I thought.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.528
I'll talk to Chip about it.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.327
Hey, hey, hey!

04:45.410 --> 04:47.538
-Happy birthday weekend, Big Daddy!
-Okay!

04:47.621 --> 04:49.039
Thank you. Thank you.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.458
-Happy birthday!
-Hi!

04:52.876 --> 04:54.336
-Hey, happy birthday, man.
-Jake!

04:54.753 --> 04:55.838
Man of the hour.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.799
-Don't shortchange me there, Daniel. Hey!
-There he is!

04:59.383 --> 05:00.843
-Man of the year.
-There you go.

05:00.926 --> 05:01.927
-Hey!
-Happy birthday.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.054
Thank you. What do we have?
What do we have?

05:05.472 --> 05:07.307
"Power's yet to be restored in Puerto Rico

05:07.391 --> 05:10.060
following the devastation
of Hurricane Maria"?

05:11.186 --> 05:12.187
Thank you.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.147
The perfect gift for the woman
who has everything.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.149
How old does this make you?

05:17.109 --> 05:20.320
Well, if this were Logan's Run,
they would've killed me 20 years ago.

05:21.697 --> 05:22.739
Help me out?

05:23.282 --> 05:24.950
Old enough to have seen Logan's Run.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.118
Hey.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.288
Hey.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.331
Happy birthday.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.583
Thanks, not till Sunday.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.792
-Oh, yeah.
-But thank you.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.629
-Happy birthday to you...
-Thank you.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.300
You got the Hurricane Maria copy there?

05:41.383 --> 05:42.634
-I do.
-Okay.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.803
-See you in a bit.
-All right.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.890
-Hey!
-Hey! It's the fuckin' birthday boy!

05:57.941 --> 05:59.193
What's that spot?

06:00.319 --> 06:02.863
That's just a finger smudge. My bad.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.323
Oh, my gosh. There it is.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.784
Wow! It's here.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.245
Thanks, man.
Appreciate you bringing it this early.

06:10.329 --> 06:13.582
-Hey, thanks. Wow.
-That's why they call it a crotch rocket.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.668
Oh, my God. Mitch is gonna love this.

06:16.752 --> 06:19.254
-Which is so lame.
-I agree.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.508
Chip, we have a scheduling conflict here.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.968
You have me doing
the education reform debate.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.387
And it's the same day
as the wild card game.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.766
-Yes, about that.
-Yes.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.684
Mitch is gonna cover it.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.812
What? Why?

06:36.438 --> 06:39.775
It's not a big deal. The network
just wants to try Mitch on the playoffs.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.278
But I do the playoffs.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.614
Yeah, but I think they just wanna try it.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.116
YDA's closing the gap.
They're just throwing shit at the wall,

06:48.200 --> 06:49.868
see if they can get more eyeballs
in the morning.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.662
You'll be back on it next year. It's fine.

06:52.079 --> 06:56.542
Chip, people expect to see me in
the studio after the game as a tradition.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.586
Isn't that what baseball's all about?
Tradition?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.130
It's a museum masquerading as a sport?

07:02.464 --> 07:04.675
Look, I'm on your side, okay? It's just...

07:04.758 --> 07:07.469
The network gets a little nervous,
and they did a test.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.764
What?

07:11.723 --> 07:12.975
A test?

07:13.392 --> 07:14.977
The network did a test?

07:16.854 --> 07:22.484
I see. So they pay people 50 bucks to
come in for a ten-cent opinion.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.820
Exactly.
It's stupid, and it's random, okay?

07:24.903 --> 07:28.323
It's just that Mitch happened to
test very well.

07:28.407 --> 07:32.119
Mitch tests really well
when he tests with me. Okay?

07:32.202 --> 07:33.829
-I agree.
-Did they test him with Alison?

07:33.912 --> 07:36.582
Because that's when they should've
tested him, when I was away last month.

07:36.665 --> 07:41.086
Because this party of one,
this focus group, saw it and it sucked.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.546
Look, they're gonna do more tests.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.507
The cream is gonna rise to the top.
You are gonna be fine. Relax.

07:45.591 --> 07:49.136
Oh, my God.
Chip, you used to be my producer.

07:49.595 --> 07:53.682
Don't pull that shit on--
I am still your producer, okay?

07:53.765 --> 07:58.020
I found you. Hello. I found you.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.564
And now you've found your golden goose?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.900
No, you are my golden goose.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.320
It's just that, technically,
I have two golden geese.

08:07.196 --> 08:11.366
But now Mitch has you and Fred
and Reid in his side pocket.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.076
And I know what you guys do.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.205
You hang out, you talk about girls.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.582
You smoke cigars, you play golf.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.252
You give Mitch more good stories,
then more people love Mitch.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.880
The more people that love Mitch,
the better he's gonna test. Come on.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.841
I get this. I'm not an idiot.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.343
It's not that complicated.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.427
-I know.
-Come on.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.637
-What?
-Makeup's ready for you.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.347
All right. Thank you.
I'm not done with this conversation.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.807
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.017
-Seriously?
-What?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.268
Don't worry.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.854
Do I look worried?

08:41.270 --> 08:43.357
Worried. Jesus.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.862
-Coffee for you.
-Claire, right?

08:48.946 --> 08:49.947
-Yes.
-Okay.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.366
-And one of these is yours.
-Yes, thank you.

08:52.783 --> 08:55.786
-And, Lay... Layla...
-Thanks. I'll be fine with that.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.954
Okay.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.581
-Lindsey...
-Yes, hi.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.124
-Take that.
-Thank you, Carla.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.418
-And...
-It's Claire, but--

09:03.836 --> 09:05.337
And Donny. Donny...

09:05.420 --> 09:07.631
Oh, Donny! That's yours.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.051
And Jared...

09:14.096 --> 09:15.639
-Coffee.
-Thanks.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.475
Sorry to bother you, but who is Jared?

09:18.559 --> 09:20.519
Sorry, there are just so many names
to learn here.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.521
I'm Jared. Head booker. Learn my name.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.147
Sorry.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.359
-Don't take it personally. He's just--
-An asshole?

09:27.442 --> 09:28.443
Well, yeah.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.153
Sorry he's your direct superior.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.948
It's all a learning experience.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.117
But I have my goals I'm here to achieve,

09:35.200 --> 09:38.161
so I just figure
I'll use every part of the buffalo,

09:38.245 --> 09:39.246
even the asshole.

09:39.663 --> 09:40.664
-Claire?
-Yes.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.333
Go make sure Alison's dress showed up
for the birthday segment, would you?

09:43.417 --> 09:44.459
-Will do.
-Thank you.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.961
Thank you for being human.

09:47.462 --> 09:48.839
-Hey, Jared. Come here.
-Yeah.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.090
-What's up?
-What the fuck, dude?

09:50.174 --> 09:51.758
What do you mean "what the fuck"?
What's going on?

09:51.842 --> 09:54.469
Why is Alex talking to Owen Gorman
for the Homeland Security story?

09:54.553 --> 09:56.763
You asked me to find someone
to cover the confirmation hearing.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.057
No, I asked you to find a senator
to cover the hearing.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.018
Someone who is,
I don't know, in the actual Senate.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.102
Here you go. Thank you.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.313
As you know, Gorman is a member
of the House of Representatives.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.273
We do not care about
the opinion of Florida's second district.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.482
Gorman is great TV.

10:07.566 --> 10:08.859
Gorman's an attention whore.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.028
He's also an attention whore
that you book biweekly.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.697
So from now on,
there is a moratorium on booking Gorman,

10:13.780 --> 10:15.699
unless there's a fucking atomic bomb
in Tallahassee.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.618
I had Reuben Bowen,
but his press secretary just pulled--

10:17.701 --> 10:19.203
There are 14 senators in this committee.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.330
-One of them wants to talk.
-It's late in the game.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.333
I have some connections
in Sadie Worthington's office.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.043
I can see if I can get her.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.753
Yes! Fuck, yes! This--

10:27.836 --> 10:29.463
Why did you wait until now
to share that information?

10:29.546 --> 10:30.547
-Guys, who cares?
-I...

10:30.631 --> 10:32.341
-Who cares? Just go. Go. Go.
-Going.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.842
I'm gonna push the story as late as I can.

10:33.926 --> 10:34.927
-Keep me updated.
-Okay!

10:35.010 --> 10:36.011
Jesus. Fuck.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.639
-She's a go-getter.
-Yeah. Gorgeous too.

10:38.931 --> 10:41.058
You're so shallow.
Get your head out of the gutter.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.976
I learned by watching you, Dad.

10:43.060 --> 10:47.105
Do you ever pinch yourself because you got
me instead of Alex? I gotta be more fun.

10:47.189 --> 10:48.440
Gee, you think?

10:49.608 --> 10:52.402
-Good mornin'!
-Oh, well, well.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.239
Happy 5-0, Mr. Kessler

10:55.322 --> 10:57.908
Wow. Am I old enough for you yet?

10:58.242 --> 11:02.287
Give it a couple of years. Nothing gets
my juices flowing like an AARP discount.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.498
I will put it in my calendar.

11:05.791 --> 11:10.170
Alison, wow.
That dress is something else. Really nice.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.339
-Alex!
-Yes.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.258
You see that dress that Alison's wearing?

11:14.883 --> 11:18.262
That dress that was just
in my immediate eyeline? Yes, I did.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.557
-I did see it.
-Why don't you wear any dresses like that?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.767
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Hey, Chip, Chip.

11:24.268 --> 11:27.229
Can we get some dresses like that
for Alex? Is that doable?

11:27.312 --> 11:28.897
Yeah, I'll see if I can pull some strings.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.608
Nope. Don't pull anything, Chip.
We're good.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.902
We are live in 30 seconds.

11:33.986 --> 11:34.987
-You know what?
-Mm-mmm.

11:35.571 --> 11:37.447
I would take you in that dress
over Alison any day.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.615
Last looks.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.158
You're so sweet.

11:40.242 --> 11:43.537
Because if you were wearing the dress,
that would mean she's naked.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.707
-There it is!
-Right?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.709
We had it. First of the day, guys.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.171
-You saw that coming.
-I did.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.797
You knew. You knew I was gonna do that.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.507
-I didn't wanna spoil your punch line.
-Thank you.

11:55.591 --> 12:00.304
-Thank you for going with me.
-We are live in five, four, three...

12:01.930 --> 12:02.931
Wow.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.397
Good morning, everyone,
and welcome to The Morning Show.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.649
Our top story today:

12:12.733 --> 12:15.569
Puerto Rico continues to grapple
with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria,

12:15.652 --> 12:19.448
as criticism escalates over
the federal response to the deadly storm.

12:19.948 --> 12:23.911
We now go to Yanko Flores, who is
reporting live from Puerto Rico. Yanko.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.245
-And take it.
-Morning, Mitch.

12:25.329 --> 12:29.374
It's been devastating to witness
conditions here in San Juan today.

12:29.458 --> 12:33.795
The power lines are down.
So many homes are destroyed.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.255
More resources from FEMA,

12:35.339 --> 12:38.050
from the Pentagon,
are expected to arrive early next week.

12:38.467 --> 12:42.471
But until then, the recovery efforts are--
They're proceeding slowly.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.306
How is morale there, Yanko?

12:44.973 --> 12:50.479
Resilient. Truly beautiful, the way that
people are hanging together here on...

12:50.562 --> 12:55.150
la isla del encanto, the Island of
Enchantment as it is affectionately known.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.779
They will recover,
but they could use some caring.

12:58.862 --> 13:04.326
They've had plenty of this force of nature
that just comes through by its own will,

13:04.409 --> 13:07.204
destroys everything and doesn't care.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.749
You have reached the office
of Senator Sadie Worthington.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.127
Due to high call volume, we are
currently unavailable to take your call.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.212
Fuck.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.388
-Hannah?
-Christine, hi.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.848
Thanks for calling me back.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.934
I can't get through to
Senator Worthington's office in DC--

13:29.017 --> 13:31.270
I don't work
for Senator Worthington anymore.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.314
Could you possibly
put me in touch with your--

13:34.398 --> 13:36.942
You never even RSVP'd
to my baby shower.

13:38.443 --> 13:42.865
I'm so sorry.
I'm always traveling for work.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.908
But I do need help.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.827
Or to my goodbye party.

13:50.831 --> 13:51.874
I blew it.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.793
I fuckin' blew it.

13:55.752 --> 14:01.425
I threw myself into work,
and I didn't prioritize our friendship.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.556
I didn't prioritize
any of my personal relationships,

14:07.639 --> 14:09.308
which is clearly not healthy,

14:09.391 --> 14:11.768
but I don't give myself time
to think about that.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.813
I never asked you to put me
ahead of your work.

14:14.897 --> 14:19.109
I only asked for a small amount of decency
from someone I considered my friend.

14:23.113 --> 14:27.910
Listen, I know it doesn't
excuse anything, but...

14:31.747 --> 14:37.377
living in New York by myself
without family, without support...

14:39.296 --> 14:40.714
has been a bitch.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.760
I moved home because I needed it too.

14:52.392 --> 14:56.855
I've just been trying to survive,
you know? It gets scary.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.899
You really hurt my feelings.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.530
I am so sorry.

15:07.199 --> 15:11.912
Really, Christine, I feel horrible.

15:13.539 --> 15:16.875
It's okay, Hannah.
Tell me what you need.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.336
Really?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.965
Coming up, more of our top stories.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.883
And later in the hour,

15:24.967 --> 15:28.178
we sit down with the star of fall's
hottest new show

15:28.262 --> 15:30.973
that's already setting ratings records.

15:31.056 --> 15:34.977
Elsa Hanford from UBA's own
Late Bloomers is with us next.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.188
-Supposed to be great.
-Yep. Oh, wait. What's that?

15:38.272 --> 15:40.899
Yes, yes, yes. And I also hear

15:40.983 --> 15:44.945
that it's someone's big birthday
coming up this weekend.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.363
No, no.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.783
-We are not going to do that, are we?
-Jesus!

15:49.867 --> 15:55.330
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

15:55.414 --> 15:57.165
Apparently, we are going to do that.

15:57.249 --> 15:59.710
Yes, we are, my friend.

16:00.502 --> 16:03.130
Stay tuned, everyone.
We will be right back.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.298
Oh, no.

16:04.381 --> 16:07.050
You thought someone shot you, didn't you?
'Cause I did.

16:07.801 --> 16:08.927
And we're clear.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.637
-Oh, God.
-Hey.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.223
Sorry.

16:13.307 --> 16:17.936
What bullshit has been planned
for this horrible, horrible birthday?

16:18.020 --> 16:21.273
Just the normal love wrapped in mockery.

16:21.356 --> 16:24.735
You know it well. A cake, possibly.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.195
God. Fifty! Kill me!

16:26.278 --> 16:28.030
-Yeah.
-Just kill me right now.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.115
You make 50 look so good.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.492
You really do. Happy birthday, honey.

16:32.576 --> 16:35.120
I would not wanna spend it
with anyone other than you.

16:39.583 --> 16:40.584
Thanks, honey.

16:41.502 --> 16:42.836
-Jesus!
-God!

16:42.920 --> 16:43.962
My God!

16:44.463 --> 16:45.881
-Gimme that.
-I hate this.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.133
I'm sorry. It wasn't my idea.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.677
-I gotta get it outta there.
-Get it off of me.

16:50.761 --> 16:53.805
-Here we go.
-Don't--

16:54.640 --> 16:56.183
Don't-- What are you doing?
What are you doing?

16:56.266 --> 16:57.267
I can't get it off!

16:57.351 --> 17:00.854
No, no. Come on. Come on. No!
You can't pick up that ball.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.232
You can't pick up that ball. No.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.194
-Goal!
-No. He got it. He got it.

17:07.778 --> 17:09.238
Oh, no.

17:09.905 --> 17:12.241
Oh, no, no.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.785
You gotta go. No, he's coming in.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.993
He's come-- Don't do it.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.915
Don't do it.

17:20.332 --> 17:21.583
Mitch.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.670
I thought you were getting ready.

17:24.752 --> 17:25.752
Okay, guys. Guys.

17:25.838 --> 17:29.091
We're supposed to meet Fred and Geneva
at the restaurant in less than an hour.

17:29.174 --> 17:32.261
Like a herd of turtles. Come on. Get up.

17:37.975 --> 17:40.644
Good boys. Thank you.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.605
Let me see.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.400
-Thanks, Mom.
-Napkin on your lap. Napkin on your lap.

17:54.825 --> 17:57.077
-Here. Let me cut that for you. Come here.
-Thank you, Mom.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.413
Can I use your fork? Thanks, honey.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.293
There you go.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.816
I'm sorry, Paige.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.696
Are you kidding?

18:33.530 --> 18:34.823
No, I'm not.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.454
I've been thinking a lot.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.790
Since your most recent affair broke up?

18:47.920 --> 18:48.921
Yes.

18:55.928 --> 18:56.929
I'm sorry.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.310
Okay.

19:07.231 --> 19:10.484
Paige, we've built a life together.
We have two beautiful kids.

19:13.237 --> 19:14.738
I wanna try.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.495
It's hard for me to believe you.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.539
I know.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.222
Oh, shit.

19:41.765 --> 19:42.891
Hey, Chipper.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.519
Don't say anything uncouth.
Paige is in the car.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.937
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.064
So sorry to bug you on a Sunday night.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.483
Yeah, and on my birthday, asshole.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.986
Oh, shit. I'm an asshole.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.905
I am so sorry, but I swear
this will just take one second.

19:56.989 --> 20:00.409
Look, pain in the ass, we gotta move up
the attorney general interviews.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.828
I really wanna get you
this research in copy

20:02.911 --> 20:04.663
so you're not flying blind for tomorrow.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.748
-Yeah?
-Fine. Just send it to the house.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.626
The restaurant's right by the studio.

20:09.710 --> 20:13.046
We could just stop by in,
like, five minutes and pick it up.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.882
That would be great.
You sure you don't mind?

20:15.424 --> 20:17.426
No, it's fine. Right, Mitch?

20:21.680 --> 20:22.890
Yeah.

20:22.973 --> 20:27.060
Yeah, sure, we'll be late for our dinner,
but that's fine.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.145
Okay.

20:28.228 --> 20:31.064
I will leave it with security.
Have a good night.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.526
It'll just take a second.

20:48.123 --> 20:51.084
-Hey, Jim.
-Hey, Mitch. What are you doing here?

20:52.377 --> 20:54.129
Chip said he had some papers for me.

20:54.213 --> 20:55.714
He didn't leave anything with me.

20:55.797 --> 20:58.759
But I can look around and see if he left
them with Pat before I got here.

20:58.842 --> 20:59.843
Is Chip here?

21:00.969 --> 21:04.348
Yeah. Looks like he's in the studio.
You have to go through the control room.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.100
They're buffing the floors
outside the greenroom.

21:07.184 --> 21:09.269
-Okay, thank you.
-You're welcome.

21:09.353 --> 21:10.896
"Buffing the floors."

21:28.288 --> 21:30.415
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

21:31.416 --> 21:33.126
Oh, my God!

21:36.296 --> 21:38.215
Oh, God. Were you surprised?

21:38.298 --> 21:39.675
So fucking surprised.

21:39.758 --> 21:42.302
Well, buckle up, mister.
This is gonna get better.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.598
Here we go. Come on.

21:47.808 --> 21:49.142
-Look at that!
-I know.

21:52.229 --> 21:53.772
When did you do this?

21:53.856 --> 21:56.483
Oh, you know,
all the spare time that I have.

22:01.446 --> 22:03.198
Oh, my God!

22:03.949 --> 22:05.534
What the fuck?

22:08.453 --> 22:09.830
-No, no.
-You're in heaven.

22:09.913 --> 22:12.249
-You're in heaven. Come on. Look.
-Oh, yes.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.333
Look.

22:14.126 --> 22:16.086
Sit, sit, sit.

22:16.712 --> 22:18.088
Sit, sit.

22:26.847 --> 22:28.807
Let the party begin!

22:33.437 --> 22:34.980
Ladies!

22:39.193 --> 22:42.988
-When you hear the alarm go ding-a-ling
-So early

22:43.071 --> 22:46.617
-All tune in to watch the morning king
-Oh, great one

22:46.700 --> 22:50.204
-When ratings come YDA stands not a chance
-Those losers

22:50.287 --> 22:53.457
Mitch Kessler turns 50 tonight

22:53.874 --> 22:57.002
Privilege can't change him
He's always one of us

22:57.085 --> 22:58.086
Hold on now

22:58.170 --> 23:00.923
Speaks truth to power
Brings down the treasonous

23:01.006 --> 23:02.007
Mitch Kessler?

23:02.090 --> 23:05.469
He's a millionaire
But he'd do it all for free

23:05.552 --> 23:08.222
Mitch Kessler turns 50 tonight

23:08.305 --> 23:10.224
No, no, no.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.226
Oh, hello!

23:12.768 --> 23:16.313
Joan of Arc made just 19
Buddy Holly, 22

23:17.022 --> 23:20.192
Old JC was 33
When we bid him adieu

23:20.651 --> 23:22.653
Which brings us to the thing we ask for

23:22.736 --> 23:24.321
-This an interview
-You're a dead man.

23:24.404 --> 23:28.075
If only the good die young, old man
What does that say for you?

23:29.117 --> 23:32.496
No, stop it! Hang on. Stop it.
Stop it. Stop the music. Enough.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.873
Can you hear me?

23:36.959 --> 23:39.044
Are you able to walk to your seat?

23:39.127 --> 23:41.046
Don't do this. Please don't do this.

23:41.129 --> 23:45.300
This man has a very delicate prostate.
So this is a long journey for him.

23:46.301 --> 23:48.220
Ooh. Oh, boy.

23:50.305 --> 23:56.103
Wait a minute, girls
No one likes a bitch

23:56.562 --> 24:00.190
So just pump the brakes

24:00.274 --> 24:02.901
And let's give praise to Mitch

24:02.985 --> 24:07.739
But then, on second thought
The girls might know you best

24:08.156 --> 24:11.493
This asshole turns 50 tonight

24:11.577 --> 24:15.831
He fawns on preening stars
And throws them all softballs

24:15.914 --> 24:19.168
Thinks his jokes deserve a curtain call
They don't...

24:47.070 --> 24:51.241
Fifty tonight

24:52.075 --> 24:58.999
Mitch Kessler turns 50 tonight

25:07.841 --> 25:09.384
Happy birthday, baby boy.

25:09.843 --> 25:12.054
Oh, my God. You are insane.

25:12.429 --> 25:13.639
Thank you.

25:15.349 --> 25:16.391
Let's do it again!

25:22.105 --> 25:23.106
Hey.

25:24.775 --> 25:26.151
More please, sir.

25:29.488 --> 25:31.907
This is where he breaks it
before he rides it.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.952
-That fits like a glove.
-Yeah. That's it.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.995
-I like it.
-I wanna try this.

25:37.079 --> 25:39.581
-Oh, no.
-Don't do-- No.

25:39.665 --> 25:41.583
-Ready?
-Okay.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.336
-God-- Put your leg over the back of it.
-No, no, no.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.921
I wanna-- I'm doing sidesaddle.

25:46.421 --> 25:48.715
Fred, why hasn't Dick done a show
for the network?

25:48.799 --> 25:51.385
I'm sorry. You might have him
confused with some other Dick Lundy

25:51.468 --> 25:53.011
who would deign
to do broadcast television.

25:53.095 --> 25:55.347
This guy is a filmmaker, damn it.
He wears berets.

25:55.764 --> 25:58.809
We should send Dick
to meet with Cory Ellison.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.811
Yeah, do a little spin-off
of Late Bloomers.

26:00.894 --> 26:03.105
After all,
it is the number one show in America.

26:03.188 --> 26:04.982
All the bus stops say so.
It's gotta be true.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.817
That's the middle-aged lesbian show?

26:06.900 --> 26:08.861
The major hit "middle-age lesbian show."

26:08.944 --> 26:10.529
Listen, I gotta hand it to the guy.

26:10.612 --> 26:14.241
Only Cory would have taken that pitch,
let alone put it on the air.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.994
Jesus. And in his first
development season? It's ballsy.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.078
The guy takes chances.

26:18.161 --> 26:20.539
-Yeah.
-Now, he's a little... unusual.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.124
-He's weird.
-He does take chances.

26:22.207 --> 26:25.085
Well, that's why he's the president
of entertainment and not news.

26:25.169 --> 26:27.171
I don't know, Reid.
You might have to take some big swings.

26:27.254 --> 26:28.881
Your Day, America's nipping at our heels.

26:28.964 --> 26:31.341
Okay. I'll start by adding lesbians.

26:31.967 --> 26:34.344
Good call.
I'm gonna go check on the real cake.

26:34.428 --> 26:35.596
Good talking to you, Chip.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.140
How much did the Ducati cost us?

26:38.223 --> 26:41.602
Not that much really.
I mean, it's a custom job. Ninety K or so.

26:41.685 --> 26:44.479
It hardly seems enough given how much
money he's made for the network.

26:44.563 --> 26:46.190
-Yeah.
-I'm glad to see him so happy.

26:46.273 --> 26:48.650
We're lucky to have him.
He just gets better with age.

26:48.734 --> 26:50.027
Yeah.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.907
Have you seen the last numbers on Alex?

26:56.200 --> 26:59.786
Yeah. I can accept the scores
on trustworthiness.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.622
In this climate,
every journalist has taken a hit,

27:01.705 --> 27:04.333
but her authenticity
and relatability numbers?

27:04.416 --> 27:05.417
-Yeah.
-Shit.

27:05.501 --> 27:07.336
-Yeah.
-When did that fucking happen?

27:07.920 --> 27:10.339
People just see her as
rich and powerful now.

27:10.881 --> 27:13.800
A "girl next door" was always her magic.

27:14.551 --> 27:16.762
Yeah. Breaks my heart.

27:17.304 --> 27:19.431
It never would occur to me,
when I hired her,

27:19.515 --> 27:22.351
that I might still be around to
put her out to pasture.

27:23.685 --> 27:26.772
Come on. We're not there yet.
We can still reinvent her a little.

27:29.942 --> 27:32.277
Yeah. Yeah. Course. Sure.

27:32.861 --> 27:34.905
We give it time. Let's see what happens.

27:36.782 --> 27:40.536
Time is cruel,
and youth is wasted on the young.

27:49.670 --> 27:51.672
Excuse me, Yanko.

27:52.089 --> 27:55.217
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm Claire. I'm the new PA.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.886
-Hey. Nice to meet you. Hi.
-Hey. Nice to meet you.

27:57.970 --> 28:00.180
Well, welcome. Welcome to the show.

28:00.889 --> 28:03.141
It's quite a baptism into this world.

28:03.225 --> 28:05.978
Yeah, and I plan to christen myself
in gin and tonics.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.187
-Nice.
-By the way,

28:07.271 --> 28:09.565
I really enjoyed your piece
on Puerto Rico.

28:09.648 --> 28:12.025
It was incredibly moving.
You're very good.

28:12.109 --> 28:15.445
And I can tell that doing the weather
actually means something to you,

28:15.529 --> 28:17.406
which is unusual. And nice.

28:18.198 --> 28:19.825
Well, thank you, Claire.

28:20.909 --> 28:22.870
You have a great deal of depth, don't you?

28:24.788 --> 28:27.457
No. No. I'm actually incredibly shallow.

28:28.917 --> 28:30.586
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

28:32.254 --> 28:34.548
-Enjoy the party.
-Yeah. You too.

28:46.894 --> 28:49.396
-Here's some people. Hello, everyone.
-Oh, hey. Hi.

28:49.479 --> 28:52.733
-How are you?
-I know, I know. Don't make a big deal.

28:53.192 --> 28:56.612
Oh, hey. Hey.
Nice job getting that senator Friday.

28:57.613 --> 29:00.032
Oh, yeah. Wow. How'd you know?

29:00.449 --> 29:03.952
Well, I kinda know everything that goes on
around this place.

29:04.036 --> 29:06.705
I know that Jared-- Where is he?

29:06.788 --> 29:10.667
Jared is lazy and complacent,
and you did the right thing speaking up.

29:11.877 --> 29:15.005
You know what you did?
You made the show better on Friday.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.423
Categorically better.

29:16.507 --> 29:20.761
So, thank you for your efforts,
and keep up the good work.

29:21.762 --> 29:22.763
Thank you so much.

29:31.188 --> 29:35.192
Mitch Kessler, we are lucky to have you.

29:35.859 --> 29:39.738
I am so lucky to have you.
Happy birthday, honey.

29:40.781 --> 29:42.658
Get up here and make some wishes.

29:43.158 --> 29:44.910
You've got about 50 of them.

29:46.245 --> 29:50.207
Happy birthday to you

29:50.290 --> 29:51.583
-Here you go.
-Oh, my gosh.

29:51.667 --> 29:55.045
Happy birthday to you

29:55.128 --> 30:00.384
Happy birthday, dear Mitch

30:00.801 --> 30:06.431
Happy birthday to you

30:13.480 --> 30:19.862
I'm very, very fortunate to have friends
like this and like this in my life.

30:20.279 --> 30:21.738
And as the last candle burns out,

30:22.614 --> 30:26.326
I say thank you so much for coming
and for being my friends. Thank you.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.828
Cheers.

30:29.621 --> 30:34.710
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

30:34.793 --> 30:38.672
For he's a jolly good fellow

30:38.755 --> 30:41.884
Which nobody can deny

30:41.967 --> 30:44.011
Nobody can deny

30:45.470 --> 30:48.182
I can't believe you.
You put together that whole thing.

30:48.932 --> 30:53.520
I picked the song, I wrote the lyrics,
I auditioned the dancers.

30:53.604 --> 30:56.273
Oh, that's it. That's it.
It all makes sense now.

30:56.356 --> 31:00.694
No. Stop it. Stop it.
I did it because I love you, Mitch.

31:00.777 --> 31:01.778
-I do.
-Oh, God.

31:01.862 --> 31:06.325
It just so happens that loving you
comes with certain fringe benefits.

31:07.784 --> 31:11.371
There are some people out there
who would vehemently disagree with you.

31:11.455 --> 31:14.208
Oh, fuck 'em! You know?

31:14.291 --> 31:15.792
One of the great things of getting old.

31:15.876 --> 31:19.046
You can just say,
"Fuck 'em, fuck it, fuck off."

31:19.796 --> 31:22.466
And be at peace with it.
You've nothing left to prove.

31:22.549 --> 31:25.636
You've carved out your place in the world,

31:26.470 --> 31:29.473
and no one and nobody can take that away.

31:31.308 --> 31:33.352
Yeah, I get that I've accomplished a lot,

31:33.435 --> 31:36.813
but it just doesn't feel like
it really matters. You know?

31:37.648 --> 31:41.818
I mean, this is all fun,
but is that all there is?

31:43.612 --> 31:47.950
I've let down people I love.
Maybe that's my legacy.

31:48.825 --> 31:50.953
At the end, maybe that's it.

31:51.995 --> 31:54.414
Please. Please, please.

31:54.998 --> 31:58.502
Look, I don't know what you've done,

31:58.585 --> 32:02.881
and you certainly don't have to tell me,
but, trust me,

32:03.340 --> 32:05.133
they're gonna get over it.

32:05.217 --> 32:06.218
They will.

32:08.679 --> 32:10.055
Although Penny...

32:11.974 --> 32:13.684
Penny never got over it.

32:16.019 --> 32:17.020
What did you do?

32:17.437 --> 32:18.814
I married Rita.

32:21.441 --> 32:23.652
-And that was a big success, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

32:23.735 --> 32:27.906
Jesus Christ.
How do I even have any money at all?

32:27.990 --> 32:29.491
I don't know.

32:29.575 --> 32:31.577
You know what? Here's the thing.

32:31.660 --> 32:34.121
You are Mitch Kessler.

32:34.997 --> 32:37.958
That matters. Don't forget that.

32:41.753 --> 32:43.630
Doesn't really feel like it matters.

32:46.466 --> 32:48.218
You know, you do all of this stuff,

32:48.302 --> 32:52.222
you achieve all of these things,
and then, at the end of the day,

32:52.306 --> 32:55.642
you're just looking at it
through a car window as you drive by.

32:55.726 --> 32:57.519
Just doesn't fill you up.

32:57.603 --> 32:59.688
You have your films.

32:59.771 --> 33:00.772
Oh, please.

33:00.856 --> 33:02.900
Dick Lundy films will be around forever.

33:02.983 --> 33:06.153
I am ephemeral.
Nobody re-watches the news,

33:06.570 --> 33:10.616
unless it's a plane flying into a building
or assassination or something.

33:10.699 --> 33:12.576
Thank God those things
don't happen very often.

33:12.659 --> 33:13.660
But...

33:15.370 --> 33:19.082
nobody re-watches
"Fall Fashion Trends 2006."

33:20.876 --> 33:23.837
So you say. Where do you think
I got the idea for this outfit?

33:34.723 --> 33:37.601
Well, I have had too much to drink.

33:40.687 --> 33:42.189
So you're heading out?

33:42.272 --> 33:44.566
Nah. I have to be here
in a couple of hours.

33:45.108 --> 33:46.527
I'll sleep when I'm dead.

33:50.197 --> 33:51.657
Fuck it.

33:53.450 --> 33:54.576
Fuck it!

33:55.827 --> 33:57.454
That's my boy.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.944
-Chip.
-I'm up. What happened?

34:29.402 --> 34:31.530
There's a shooting in Las Vegas,
happening as we speak.

34:32.656 --> 34:35.033
Oh, fu-- Holy fuck. Okay, I got it.

34:35.117 --> 34:38.161
It's active.
Outside a concert near Mandalay Bay.

34:38.245 --> 34:39.913
The police have been dispatched
to the hotel.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.791
Wait, someone's
firing into a fucking concert?

34:42.875 --> 34:43.876
Rena, get in here.

34:44.418 --> 34:46.879
I mean-- Is it still active?
How many are dead? Jesus Christ.

34:46.962 --> 34:48.005
It's not clear.

34:48.088 --> 34:51.091
Someone is saying that there
are multiple shooters in multiple hotels.

34:51.175 --> 34:52.676
I saw that, but it's unconfirmed.

34:54.511 --> 34:57.514
Let's get-- Let's get somebody from LA
to cover it right now.

34:57.598 --> 35:00.475
-Go get Mitch and Alex and tell 'em we--
-Mitch is still here.

35:00.559 --> 35:02.936
Get him! Make sure he gets on a plane
as soon as fucking possible.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.688
-Got it!
-I'll call Reid, get the jet approved.

35:04.771 --> 35:07.024
Get Mitch and Alex on that plane
fucking five minutes ago.

35:07.107 --> 35:08.108
Copy.

35:11.778 --> 35:13.280
Oh, Mitch. Good, you're ready.

35:13.363 --> 35:16.867
Car is waiting outside, and
Alex is already on her way to the airport.

35:16.950 --> 35:19.369
We're sending Alex too?
You think that's necessary?

35:19.453 --> 35:23.040
I mean, this is huge. We're doing the
whole show from there, so I need you both.

35:23.457 --> 35:26.251
Okay. If that's your call, Captain.

35:26.335 --> 35:29.171
Chip, I can't get ahold of Jared.
I'm still trying--

35:29.254 --> 35:31.298
You know what? Fuck Jared. He's slipping.

35:32.549 --> 35:35.093
Send that junior booker, Hannah.
She's excellent.

35:36.678 --> 35:37.846
Yeah, that's a good idea.

35:37.930 --> 35:41.183
-Let's find Hannah, and find Mia for me.
-Okay.

35:41.266 --> 35:43.268
Hey, I've been meaning
to talk to you about Mia.

35:43.352 --> 35:46.438
I think maybe you should take her off
my team, put her on Alex's team.

35:47.356 --> 35:49.441
It's just kind of uncomfortable right now.

35:49.525 --> 35:51.777
She's great,
but it's not a good situation.

35:54.863 --> 35:56.823
Mitch wants to move you off his team.

35:59.243 --> 36:00.452
Why?

36:01.954 --> 36:04.289
I think it's just too awkward.

36:08.627 --> 36:10.045
He's punishing me for breaking things off.

36:10.128 --> 36:11.421
-No, he is not.
-Yeah, he is. Come on.

36:11.505 --> 36:13.090
Do not take this personally, okay?

36:14.591 --> 36:16.218
Things got messy, okay?

36:16.301 --> 36:19.513
It's nobody's fault, but he does have
a right to say who he wants on his team.

36:19.596 --> 36:21.598
And I'm sorry. It's--

36:24.184 --> 36:25.185
Where you gonna put me?

36:25.686 --> 36:27.729
-On Alex's team.
-Oh, my God.

36:27.813 --> 36:31.108
It's gonna be best, all things considered.
I'll speak with her about it.

36:33.110 --> 36:34.403
So I'm not going to Vegas?

36:35.153 --> 36:36.154
No.

36:36.572 --> 36:38.198
You get to stay back here with me.

36:41.368 --> 36:44.371
Listen. I really need
your help on this one.

36:47.207 --> 36:48.292
Okay, boss.

36:49.376 --> 36:51.753
I'll get on social,
figure out everything I can.

36:57.259 --> 36:58.260
Shit.

36:58.343 --> 37:00.637
It's gonna be a block of rooms.
Fifteen people.

37:00.721 --> 37:04.099
At least two suites,
as close to the scene as possible.

37:04.183 --> 37:05.267
-You're looking for me?
-Yeah.

37:05.350 --> 37:07.019
You're going to Vegas to do the booking.

37:07.102 --> 37:08.729
-Me?
-Yeah, you're leaving now.

37:08.812 --> 37:09.897
What about Jared?

37:09.980 --> 37:11.690
Mitch wants you. So...

37:14.776 --> 37:17.613
Congrats.
Now get the fuck out of here. Please.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.406
Thank you.

37:23.869 --> 37:26.830
All units, we have shots fired
at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.

37:26.914 --> 37:28.457
Shots are coming from the higher floors.

37:28.790 --> 37:32.586
Details are extremely limited at this
time, but here's what we do know.

37:32.669 --> 37:35.547
There is one, possibly two shooters

37:35.631 --> 37:38.509
that began opening fire from
the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino...

37:38.592 --> 37:41.428
-Oh, my God.
-...on one of the top floors.

37:41.512 --> 37:43.055
They're firing into
the Route 91 Harvest Festival.

37:43.138 --> 37:45.390
We'll feed you updates as we get 'em.

37:45.474 --> 37:47.226
-Concert performer Jason Aldean...
-Okay.

37:47.309 --> 37:49.853
-...had just taken the stage.
-All right. Let's go.

37:49.937 --> 37:52.481
The concertgoers
thought they were hearing fireworks.

37:58.946 --> 37:59.947
Sick.

38:06.703 --> 38:08.413
Why do people keep doing this?

38:08.497 --> 38:09.915
I wish I knew.

38:10.582 --> 38:12.334
It's just so overwhelming.

38:12.835 --> 38:14.962
-You can't cry right now.
-I know. I know.

38:15.045 --> 38:16.463
-Think of something else.
-Okay, okay.

38:16.547 --> 38:18.131
-Do Kegels.
-Oh, God.

38:18.215 --> 38:20.551
-Okay. We're live in five...
-I'm sorry.

38:20.634 --> 38:23.011
...four, three...

38:27.182 --> 38:28.976
We're coming to you from Las Vegas,

38:29.059 --> 38:32.271
where over 50 people are confirmed dead
and hundreds injured

38:32.354 --> 38:36.650
in what will go down as the deadliest
mass shooting in US history.

38:37.484 --> 38:40.946
Last night, a gunman opened fire
from the window of a guest room

38:41.029 --> 38:45.200
at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino
into a sea of concertgoers

38:45.284 --> 38:48.078
at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.

38:48.161 --> 38:50.455
A motive has yet to be determined.

38:50.873 --> 38:55.878
As a city and a nation mourn
in the wake of this horrific tragedy,

38:55.961 --> 39:00.632
we will be with you to try to make sense
of an act that cannot be made sense of.

39:03.135 --> 39:05.012
Yes, okay. Of course.

39:05.512 --> 39:06.805
All right, see you soon.

39:08.682 --> 39:10.017
-Hey, Greg.
-Yeah.

39:10.100 --> 39:13.937
I'm gonna meet a girl
whose friend was killed last night.

39:14.730 --> 39:17.524
She thinks she might be willing
to go on the show tomorrow.

39:18.066 --> 39:19.067
Good work, Hannah.

39:20.027 --> 39:21.028
Okay.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.371
Do you think we're dead inside?

39:33.373 --> 39:35.918
I think we're in an induced coma.

39:40.255 --> 39:42.257
How long can we keep doing this?

39:43.926 --> 39:49.515
It's just not natural
to face this kind of pain...

39:50.349 --> 39:53.435
this often... on this level.

39:55.145 --> 39:58.023
Yeah, I don't know. It's awful.

39:59.107 --> 40:01.276
But it might be
the most natural thing there is.

40:03.153 --> 40:06.657
Pain is the most innate part
of the human experience I can think of.

40:10.994 --> 40:13.205
It's very depressing.

40:14.957 --> 40:20.879
It's funny, because, really, the unnatural
part is having this much money.

40:22.673 --> 40:26.969
Part of being this successful is having
enough money to not have to see the pain.

40:27.427 --> 40:30.055
That's why everybody wants to live
in these really nice,

40:30.138 --> 40:32.766
upscale, safe neighborhoods.

40:33.392 --> 40:37.980
So they don't have to
see the realities of life.

40:41.692 --> 40:43.861
The world is unfair and sad.

40:44.361 --> 40:45.612
It's ugly.

40:46.238 --> 40:48.323
And we hide from it in our wealth.

40:50.075 --> 40:52.619
But then the way you and I make our money,

40:52.703 --> 40:56.456
is we put ourselves right in the middle
of everybody else's pain.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.423
But here we are,

41:05.007 --> 41:08.010
with no escape hatch
on this very lucrative,

41:08.093 --> 41:10.888
highly visible hamster wheel from hell.

41:12.848 --> 41:17.644
I don't know how I would do all of this
every day if I didn't have you.

41:18.562 --> 41:19.730
I really don't.

41:22.024 --> 41:23.525
Well, Alex...

41:26.987 --> 41:31.450
you are my best friend,
and all bullshit aside,

41:31.533 --> 41:33.160
you're like a part of me.

41:33.744 --> 41:35.078
You always will be.

41:36.747 --> 41:38.040
Me too, honey.

41:48.133 --> 41:49.801
Okay. We should get back to the hotel.

41:49.885 --> 41:52.596
No. No, no. Don't go.

41:52.679 --> 41:55.891
There's a bar somewhere
with our name on it, calling to us.

41:55.974 --> 41:57.601
We should go drinking.

42:00.604 --> 42:03.357
You have barely slept in 48 hours.

42:04.274 --> 42:05.692
It's time to put you to bed.

42:05.776 --> 42:07.194
-I know. You're right.
-I know.

42:07.861 --> 42:09.404
-You're always right.
-Yeah.

42:10.030 --> 42:11.949
Will you always tell me what to do?

42:12.324 --> 42:13.325
I can do that.

42:53.532 --> 42:55.284
-Hey, man. What's up?
-Hey.

43:48.212 --> 43:49.505
Hey. Hiya.

43:50.964 --> 43:52.049
How you doing?

43:53.300 --> 43:55.344
Oh, I'm fine.

43:56.595 --> 43:57.638
Really?

43:59.556 --> 44:03.143
You shouldn't be.
There's nothing fine about this.

44:13.153 --> 44:14.530
Let's walk back to the hotel.

44:22.621 --> 44:25.415
This is tough. This one especially.

44:27.751 --> 44:30.963
You know, you can't beat yourself up
over not being a robot.

44:31.296 --> 44:35.133
Sometimes you just have to
feel sad as shit and live with it.

44:36.552 --> 44:38.929
Okay then. I'm sad as shit.

44:40.138 --> 44:41.139
That-a-girl.

44:46.937 --> 44:50.524
I don't think I've ever learned
so much in a single day.

44:51.233 --> 44:53.235
Yeah, you're a sponge, aren't you?

44:53.318 --> 44:56.655
You just absorb stuff.
Absorb all sorts of information.

44:56.738 --> 44:57.990
That's what makes you smart.

44:58.949 --> 45:03.078
And you really care about your job.
That's why I wanted you to be here.

45:07.624 --> 45:08.625
Thank you.

45:10.002 --> 45:11.003
Thank you.

45:30.522 --> 45:33.233
Chip, this doesn't make any sense.

45:33.317 --> 45:36.862
I was just with him.
He didn't mention a word about this.

45:37.237 --> 45:38.864
Does he honestly think I'm--

45:39.656 --> 45:43.327
No, I'm not--
I'm not taking Mitch's hand-me-downs.

45:43.410 --> 45:45.329
Alex, Mia is not a hand-me-down.

45:46.079 --> 45:48.457
So, he's not comfortable with her
on his team?

45:48.540 --> 45:51.418
Well, I'm not comfortable with her
on my team. You know what?

45:52.336 --> 45:55.047
He can shit where he eats
all that he wants,

45:55.130 --> 45:58.050
but I am not his fucking trash can.

45:59.051 --> 46:03.597
Okay. Hold on. Okay. Mitch has done
really, really well with Mia on his team.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.642
And maybe with her on your team, you know,
she might help you--

46:06.725 --> 46:11.772
Are you really trying to tell me that
Mia on my team will help me test better?

46:12.814 --> 46:14.733
No, Alex, all I am saying is you--

46:14.816 --> 46:15.984
No, that's it. I'm done.

46:16.068 --> 46:17.694
I'm hanging up on you. I'm over this.

46:17.778 --> 46:18.946
Alex-- Come on.

46:24.034 --> 46:25.077
Fuck.

46:25.911 --> 46:27.120
Great.

46:29.498 --> 46:31.542
You know what I think about
when I'm sad as shit...

46:31.625 --> 46:34.211
-What?
-...and trying not to kill myself?

46:34.294 --> 46:35.337
Stupid things.

46:36.505 --> 46:41.802
Like this one time, I was younger
than you, just getting started.

46:42.636 --> 46:46.181
KQWK in Sacramento,

46:46.682 --> 46:50.310
ten minutes before 6:00,
the anchor's appendix burst.

46:51.061 --> 46:54.606
That's-- No. That's not--
That's not the funny part.

46:55.315 --> 46:59.862
So, none of the fill-ins were available,
so they came to me.

47:00.362 --> 47:03.407
Now, I assure you,
I was way, way down on their list.

47:03.490 --> 47:06.285
I bet that they went to the janitor
before they came to me.

47:06.368 --> 47:07.828
They asked him, he turned it down,

47:07.911 --> 47:10.539
and then they came knocking
on Mitch Kessler's door.

47:11.290 --> 47:14.084
And I was scared shitless.

47:14.168 --> 47:18.255
My shit had left town on a bus.

47:20.883 --> 47:24.428
But I just figured, you know, I want this.

47:25.304 --> 47:29.224
This is my opportunity to show the people
who make the decisions

47:29.308 --> 47:30.601
that I got the goods.

47:31.018 --> 47:32.686
So, I gathered myself,

47:33.103 --> 47:35.606
I put on my very finest tie,

47:36.356 --> 47:39.985
and I went and I assumed my place
at the anchor desk.

47:40.777 --> 47:42.738
And then I passed out.

47:43.697 --> 47:46.533
And I went right over
the back of the chair.

47:46.617 --> 47:49.703
And I woke up in an ambulance.

47:49.786 --> 47:55.292
The EMTs told me that I kept throwing
to them for sports and weather.

47:56.001 --> 47:59.713
Twenty-seven stitches. Look at that.
Right there.

47:59.796 --> 48:01.548
-Oh, my God.
-Yep.

48:01.632 --> 48:04.718
I am very happy
that I don't have Daniel's hair.

48:05.802 --> 48:06.803
You...

48:07.638 --> 48:10.098
You didn't fall out of a chair.
You're doing great.

48:11.600 --> 48:15.437
I know that this is a really dark day
to associate with your big break,

48:15.521 --> 48:17.814
but that's the gig.

48:18.607 --> 48:23.529
Sometimes it's strange, sometimes
downright awful, but you're doing it.

48:25.989 --> 48:29.743
And you are helping to bring the news
to the world,

48:29.826 --> 48:31.453
and you should be proud of that.

48:33.372 --> 48:36.708
-Thank you.
-Oh, yeah. I'm a font of wisdom.

48:37.376 --> 48:39.044
I appreciate the pep talk.

48:39.127 --> 48:41.880
Yuck. Thank you. Thank you.

48:43.173 --> 48:46.885
Actually, when I'm really depressed,

48:46.969 --> 48:50.180
there is one thing that I do have
in my arsenal.

48:52.891 --> 48:54.768
Why don't you
improve your lie a little, sir?

48:54.852 --> 48:56.854
Yes, yes. Winter rules. Right.

48:56.937 --> 48:58.272
I can't believe you've never seen this.

48:58.355 --> 48:59.898
Double farts!

49:02.651 --> 49:04.653
-Fore!
-Fine shot.

49:09.950 --> 49:11.660
I shoulda yelled "two."

49:11.743 --> 49:14.246
-Wow. Is it really that bad?
-Why don't you walk this off, sir?

49:14.329 --> 49:16.790
-You hate it.
-I'm sorry.

49:16.874 --> 49:18.292
Hey, what do you got in here? Rocks?

49:18.375 --> 49:21.920
Are you kidding? When I was your age,
I would lug 50 pounds of ice up five--

49:22.004 --> 49:26.758
It's just... I'm not an expert
at shoving it down just yet. I'm sorry.

49:26.842 --> 49:28.343
-I'll try--
-No, no, no.

49:31.555 --> 49:33.390
You're probably healthier than I am.

49:37.644 --> 49:40.272
Maybe I'm just tired,
and it's catching up with me.

49:41.523 --> 49:42.649
Yeah.

49:44.651 --> 49:46.320
I should go.

49:50.407 --> 49:53.160
I know you have to be up early,
'cause I do too.

49:53.243 --> 49:54.244
No, it's okay.

49:55.996 --> 49:57.164
Thanks.

50:24.274 --> 50:25.651
You smell good.

50:38.580 --> 50:39.581
I like you.

50:43.669 --> 50:45.879
I like you too.

51:04.815 --> 51:07.860
This isn't what
I expected when I came up here.

51:08.360 --> 51:09.444
I know.

51:10.153 --> 51:12.114
It's a nice surprise though, isn't it?

51:14.032 --> 51:15.117
You know?

51:16.159 --> 51:17.202
Hey.

51:20.038 --> 51:21.832
It's okay. Just wanna feel good.

51:30.257 --> 51:31.884
You're so beautiful.

51:35.220 --> 51:36.388
It's okay.

53:37.342 --> 53:39.219
-Push that story in.
-Yes, sir.

53:40.387 --> 53:42.264
-Yeah, everything's up and ready.
-Right.

53:42.347 --> 53:44.141
-Ready to go.
-Yeah.

53:44.224 --> 53:45.767
We just need to come up with...

53:46.393 --> 53:48.437
No, that's exactly what he said.

53:49.771 --> 53:52.316
So we're just gonna put that up front now.

53:53.317 --> 53:55.736
We're turning to something
a little bit more...

53:57.821 --> 53:59.114
Hannah.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.659
Hannah.

54:02.743 --> 54:04.203
Here are the Springsteen tickets

54:04.286 --> 54:07.289
that Jared needed
for the mother of the septuplets.

54:08.457 --> 54:09.958
-Oh, right. Yeah.
-Yeah.

54:10.042 --> 54:11.376
I'll get those to him.

54:12.961 --> 54:13.962
Hey.

54:15.380 --> 54:16.715
How was Vegas?

54:20.969 --> 54:23.597
-It was really sad.
-Yeah.

54:33.732 --> 54:35.651
-Hey, Mitch. Welcome back.
-Thank you.

54:39.655 --> 54:40.656
Hey, Hannah.

56:21.632 --> 56:24.259
Hey. You can't go in there right now.

56:25.928 --> 56:27.804
I work downstairs. I need to speak to you.

56:27.888 --> 56:30.891
-I'm sorry. I told her--
-No, it's fine, James. Give us a moment.

56:38.440 --> 56:41.151
I just got back from Las Vegas
with The Morning Show.

56:44.655 --> 56:45.906
What is it, dear?

56:54.748 --> 56:59.753
Mitch Kessler invited me to his room
to watch a movie, and he wound up--

57:03.590 --> 57:04.633
He...

57:06.301 --> 57:08.303
He wound up--

57:09.680 --> 57:11.056
He...

57:11.682 --> 57:13.016
You don't have to say it.

57:14.184 --> 57:15.686
You don't have to say anything.

57:17.271 --> 57:18.522
What's your name?

57:22.234 --> 57:26.071
I'm Han-- I'm Hannah Shoenfeld.
I'm a junior booker.

57:27.739 --> 57:28.991
Hannah Shoenfeld.

57:36.123 --> 57:39.418
I've heard about you.
I hear you're doing some great work.

57:43.589 --> 57:45.048
Hannah Shoenfeld,

57:45.924 --> 57:47.759
I heard head booker...

57:49.386 --> 57:50.888
might be in your future.

58:03.150 --> 58:04.151
So...

58:04.860 --> 58:06.820
So this is how it happens?

58:09.531 --> 58:12.910
Absolutely. People do fantastic work,
and they get promoted.

58:12.993 --> 58:15.746
That is absolutely how it happens.

58:26.215 --> 58:27.216
So...

58:29.176 --> 58:31.053
I'm head booker now?

58:34.431 --> 58:35.432
Yes.

58:44.650 --> 58:45.651
Okay.

59:21.562 --> 59:25.232
The Times article details shocking
allegations against Weinstein

59:25.315 --> 59:26.692
from eight different women,

59:26.775 --> 59:29.653
ranging from workplace harassment
to sexual abuse,

59:29.736 --> 59:31.989
including unwanted physical contact,

59:32.072 --> 59:35.492
promises of career advancement
in exchange for sexual favors,

59:35.576 --> 59:38.871
and claims that the Hollywood mogul
threatened retaliation

59:38.954 --> 59:41.039
if his sexual advances were rejected.

59:41.123 --> 59:43.375
The story also alleges that Weinstein

59:43.458 --> 59:45.711
has been paying off his accusers
for over three decades...

59:45.794 --> 59:47.421
Wow, what a creep.

59:48.422 --> 59:50.215
...including actor Rose McGowan.

59:50.299 --> 59:54.720
In 1997, the Scream star reportedly
received a $100,000...

59:54.803 --> 59:56.722
I'm gonna finish our pretape
for tomorrow.

59:56.805 --> 59:59.558
-Okay.
-...during the Sundance Film Festival.

59:59.641 --> 01:00:03.729
Harvey Weinstein now intends to sue
the New York Times for defamation,

01:00:03.812 --> 01:00:06.607
-allegedly for $50 million.
-What a pig.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:10.360
A spokeswoman for the Times
states that Mr. Weinstein and his lawyer

01:00:10.444 --> 01:00:12.863
have confirmed
the essential points of the story

01:00:12.946 --> 01:00:16.200
and that Mr. Weinstein
has not pointed to any errors

01:00:16.283 --> 01:00:19.286
or challenged any facts in the story.

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:21.371
This comes after
the Oscar-winning producer

01:00:21.455 --> 01:00:24.333
first issued an attempted
conciliatory statement saying,

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:26.919
"He came of age in the '60s and '70s

01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:30.380
when all the rules about behavior
at workplaces were different.

01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:32.132
That was the culture then."

01:00:32.424 --> 01:00:35.135
Weinstein went on to say
he's brought on therapists

01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:37.513
and plans to take a leave of absence
from his company

01:00:37.596 --> 01:00:39.765
and deal with his issues head-on.
