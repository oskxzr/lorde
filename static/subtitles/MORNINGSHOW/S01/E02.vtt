00:00.711 --> 00:05.297
Fred, what happened?

00:05.299 --> 00:09.385
<i>Good morning. Mitch Kessler,
my cohost and partner of 15 years,</i>

00:09.387 --> 00:11.470
was fired today for sexual misconduct.

00:11.472 --> 00:16.767
My on-air partner, my TV husband,
is a sexual predator now?

00:16.769 --> 00:22.106
I didn't rape anybody!

00:22.108 --> 00:24.691
Hannah, you said you were looking
for stories about strong women tomorrow.

00:24.693 --> 00:26.610
Well, check this out.

00:26.612 --> 00:27.694
Yeah?

00:27.696 --> 00:30.196
You know you have over
a million views on your video?

00:30.198 --> 00:33.242
We wanna interview you
about why the video is going viral.

00:33.244 --> 00:34.785
<i>The Morning Show?</i>

00:34.787 --> 00:36.662
<i>I'm exhausted!</i>

00:36.664 --> 00:38.747
You seem a lot more relaxed today.

00:38.749 --> 00:41.458
Yeah, well, this is a whole lot nicer
than a coal mine protest,

00:41.460 --> 00:42.960
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

00:42.962 --> 00:44.712
I think people want to trust
that the person

00:44.714 --> 00:48.132
that is telling them the truth
about the world is an honest person.

00:48.134 --> 00:51.385
<i>This is Cory Ellison.
I'm the president of the UBA network.</i>

00:51.387 --> 00:53.512
How would you like to come
and meet me for a drink

00:53.514 --> 00:55.097
and talk about your future?

00:55.099 --> 00:56.974
Alex, they were going to replace you.

00:56.976 --> 00:58.183
- What?
- He came to me.

00:58.185 --> 00:59.893
They said they wanted to make a change.

00:59.895 --> 01:11.188
I don't believe you.

04:06.317 --> 04:10.110
Bradley Jackson. Thank you so much for
coming to meet me on such short notice.

04:10.112 --> 04:12.904
Come on. You're the head
of two divisions of a network.

04:12.906 --> 04:16.783
You don't have to pretend to appreciate me
dropping everything to show up.

04:16.785 --> 04:18.827
You expect that, right?

04:18.829 --> 04:22.956
I'll have bourbon on the rocks. Thanks.

04:22.958 --> 04:27.836
So, what's this about?
Late night meeting at a hotel...

04:27.838 --> 04:30.672
No, you see, sorry,
I'm one of those strange guys

04:30.674 --> 04:33.300
who only likes sleeping with women
who are actually attracted to him.

04:33.302 --> 04:34.676
So, no, I'm not hitting on you.

04:34.678 --> 04:36.303
- You see that woman over there?
- Yeah.

04:36.305 --> 04:39.765
That's Cecily.
She's my New York assistant.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.808
I'm sleeping with her.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.352
Okay.

04:43.354 --> 04:46.104
That was a joke.

04:46.106 --> 04:48.106
I'm not worried. I don't scare easily.

04:48.108 --> 04:50.192
- Well, that's abundantly clear.
- Thank you.

04:50.194 --> 04:52.235
- Thank you.
- I guess they know you here.

04:52.237 --> 04:54.529
Yeah, I come here a lot.

04:54.531 --> 04:58.033
So, Bradley, what is your story?

04:58.035 --> 04:59.409
- My story?
- Yeah.

04:59.411 --> 05:02.788
Who knows? I mean, it's probably
the same as a lot of people's stories.

05:02.790 --> 05:05.832
Kid grows up in the country
around a bunch of cows and cornfields

05:05.834 --> 05:10.962
and dreams of a life that's less about
manure and more about ideas,

05:10.964 --> 05:12.839
things that matter.

05:12.841 --> 05:18.387
Only to grow up and realize
manure matters a whole lot.

05:18.389 --> 05:22.975
Actually, I don't think that's
the same as a lot of stories at all.

05:22.977 --> 05:25.686
What's your story?

05:25.688 --> 05:27.562
I'm probably
not supposed to ask you questions

05:27.564 --> 05:31.900
'cause you're technically important,
but... What the hell? You know?

05:31.902 --> 05:34.111
Wow, being "technically important"
is about the best description

05:34.113 --> 05:36.238
of a network executive I've ever heard.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.200
What is my story? Smart kid,
dad left, I took care of my mom,

05:40.202 --> 05:45.038
I vowed to own the world one day
and kick everyone's ass into submission.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.040
How's that working out for you?

05:47.042 --> 05:49.626
Pretty well, actually.

05:49.628 --> 05:50.711
Well, cheers to that.

05:50.713 --> 05:54.548
Hell, yeah.

05:54.550 --> 05:57.342
So, what do you want from me?

05:57.344 --> 05:58.927
Do you treat every business meeting

05:58.929 --> 06:00.887
like you're being interrogated
by an enemy camp?

06:00.889 --> 06:04.766
If you're even a little smart, you know
that's what all business meetings are.

06:04.768 --> 06:10.814
Then why aren't you further along in your
career at this point, if you're so savvy?

06:10.816 --> 06:14.401
"At this point"? You mean I'm too old
to be the young, feisty journalist?

06:14.403 --> 06:17.154
I should have landed somewhere
more substantial by now?

06:17.156 --> 06:19.281
Maybe.

06:19.283 --> 06:21.366
You're incredibly smart,
you're interesting,

06:21.368 --> 06:24.036
you've got that "it" thing we're always
looking for in this business.

06:24.038 --> 06:28.457
What is it? What's held you back?

06:28.459 --> 06:30.042
I don't know.

06:30.044 --> 06:32.961
I mean, probably what you see
as something "fresh" in me

06:32.963 --> 06:35.172
is probably what held me back.

06:35.174 --> 06:37.632
I don't think like other people.

06:37.634 --> 06:41.720
I say whatever I mean. I don't play games.
I don't fit the mold.

06:41.722 --> 06:43.305
What mold is that?

06:43.307 --> 06:44.598
Any mold, really.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.725
Oh, right. A weirdo.

06:46.727 --> 06:50.520
- What?
- I don't mean that in a bad way.

06:50.522 --> 06:55.734
You just wanted to meet me in person
to see if I was crazy or not.

06:55.736 --> 06:57.736
I can see why you do good interviews.

06:57.738 --> 06:59.196
Thanks, I do.

06:59.198 --> 07:02.032
So,
aside from wondering if you were crazy,

07:02.034 --> 07:04.117
here's the other reason that
I wanted to meet you:

07:04.119 --> 07:10.874
I think we might be able to use you as
a field correspondent on The Morning Show.

07:10.876 --> 07:12.751
What, you might be able to?

07:12.753 --> 07:15.796
Well,
I've looked into your past a little bit.

07:15.798 --> 07:20.217
You have moved jobs a lot. You have
a bit of a colorful local history...

07:20.219 --> 07:23.929
Okay, Two-Fucks Jackson is...
I can explain that...

07:23.931 --> 07:25.597
"Two-Fucks" what?

07:25.599 --> 07:27.849
- What?
- What? No, I said it first.

07:27.851 --> 07:29.685
No, I was just kidding.

07:29.687 --> 07:31.770
I definitely wanna hear
about Two-Fucks Jackson.

07:31.772 --> 07:33.313
But right now...

07:33.315 --> 07:37.526
right now I'm just trying to decide
if I should give you a chance.

07:37.528 --> 07:41.154
I wanna use this Mitch Kessler scandal
to reinvent ourselves.

07:41.156 --> 07:44.282
I want smart people
with fresh perspectives.

07:44.284 --> 07:46.410
Are you offering me a job right now?

07:46.412 --> 07:48.912
Well,
I don't wanna step on my producer's toes,

07:48.914 --> 07:51.832
but I have arranged a meeting for you
with Charlie Black tomorrow.

07:51.834 --> 07:53.500
He's the executive producer
of The Morning Show.

07:53.502 --> 07:55.085
- I know who he is.
- Course you do.

07:55.087 --> 07:58.255
Can you be ready for a 9:30 meeting
tomorrow morning?

07:58.257 --> 08:01.925
I can do that.

08:01.927 --> 08:03.093
Good.

08:03.095 --> 08:04.261
Thank you for this.

08:04.263 --> 08:06.430
That's it? I don't get to hear
about Two-Fucks Jackson?

08:06.432 --> 08:10.017
Another night. I gotta start prepping.
I take my work really seriously.

08:10.019 --> 08:12.352
- I knew I liked you.
- Hey.

08:12.354 --> 08:23.689
You don't know me.

08:39.006 --> 08:41.006
Jason.

08:41.008 --> 08:42.549
What are you doing here?

08:42.551 --> 08:45.135
You cannot just
come over like this anymore.

08:45.137 --> 08:46.511
Alex, for fuck's sake,

08:46.513 --> 08:49.389
I have had our daughter on the phone,
freaking out,

08:49.391 --> 08:51.933
asking if I know where you are.

08:51.935 --> 08:54.144
Okay, well, here I am.

08:54.146 --> 08:56.188
I'm home, and I'm fine.

08:56.190 --> 08:59.232
I'll call Lizzy, and
I'll tell her that I'm fine. Thank you.

08:59.234 --> 09:01.485
Where have you been?

09:01.487 --> 09:04.196
I was just... I couldn't sleep.

09:04.198 --> 09:09.743
I couldn't sleep,
so I just went for a walk in the park.

09:09.745 --> 09:11.870
You went for a walk in the park
in the middle of the night?

09:11.872 --> 09:13.455
- Yeah.
- In the rain?

09:13.457 --> 09:15.290
Well...

09:15.292 --> 09:17.376
- What is going on with you, Alex?
- What...

09:17.378 --> 09:20.379
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm okay.

09:20.381 --> 09:23.715
I went for a walk
in the middle of the night.

09:23.717 --> 09:27.469
When else can I go for a walk in the park
without anybody bothering me?

09:27.471 --> 09:29.221
Why are you looking at me like that? I...

09:29.223 --> 09:32.516
Please, I've had the worst day of my life.

09:32.518 --> 09:36.478
I haven't had a chance to process
anything. So I went for a fucking walk.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.814
- Okay, okay. Good. Yes.
- It's fine.

09:38.816 --> 09:43.652
I will see you tomorrow night
for the event.

09:43.654 --> 09:44.861
The fucking event.

09:44.863 --> 09:47.197
Yes. I'm looking forward to it as well.

09:47.199 --> 09:58.701
- Are you?
- Yeah. Good night.

11:40.604 --> 11:42.938
Okay.

11:42.940 --> 11:54.650
Oh, fuck.

12:05.713 --> 12:15.387
Oh, God.

12:15.389 --> 12:17.097
I pushed all your calls
because after the show

12:17.099 --> 12:19.808
you'll meet with the UBA PR team
to review your speech for tonight.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.893
- They reviewed that last week.
- It's from Fred's office.

12:21.895 --> 12:24.438
Can't wait to see you get that award.
I just got a new dress for it.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.981
I can't wait to see it.

12:25.983 --> 12:28.317
Hair and makeup at your house at 3:00.
I put it in your calendar.

12:28.319 --> 12:30.068
I don't care if it came
from Fred's office.

12:30.070 --> 12:32.821
I know what I wanna say,
and I don't need them rewriting it today.

12:32.823 --> 12:34.614
Please go call them.

12:34.616 --> 12:37.242
You can't blame them for being
a little nervous about your speech.

12:37.244 --> 12:39.911
This is the first time you're in public
since this whole thing happened.

12:39.913 --> 12:43.457
Wait. What? You mean you think accepting
an award for leadership in journalism

12:43.459 --> 12:49.463
two days after my cohost of 15 years
is fired for predatory behavior is touchy?

12:49.465 --> 12:52.758
That event is gonna be a roomful
of vultures waiting for you to fuck up...

12:52.760 --> 12:55.844
Why are you stressing me out like this?
Honestly.

12:55.846 --> 12:58.388
Why don't you just give me a stroke
by 7:00? Then I won't have to go.

12:58.390 --> 12:59.723
I need to get out of this!

12:59.725 --> 13:01.099
I understand. But I...

13:01.101 --> 13:05.520
- I need this.
- Okay.

13:05.522 --> 13:06.605
Hey, Sarah.

13:06.607 --> 13:08.273
Did you call me at 4:00 this morning?

13:08.275 --> 13:11.401
I just woke up
and saw this message flashing.

13:11.403 --> 13:13.028
Yeah.

13:13.030 --> 13:18.283
Okay... I need to ask you something.

13:18.285 --> 13:20.494
In your opinion,

13:20.496 --> 13:26.208
the way that the network has been dragging
their feet on closing my new deal...

13:26.210 --> 13:29.503
does that suggest...

13:29.505 --> 13:33.090
anything unusual going on?

13:33.092 --> 13:35.509
Like what?

13:35.511 --> 13:37.928
Like...

13:37.930 --> 13:41.390
them trying to replace me?

13:41.392 --> 13:43.225
Or thinking about replacing me?

13:43.227 --> 13:45.936
Well, it's never a good thing.

13:45.938 --> 13:49.773
But it doesn't necessarily mean
anything like that.

13:49.775 --> 13:52.442
The good news is you have them
by the short hairs now.

13:52.444 --> 13:55.487
They need you in a big way.

13:55.489 --> 14:01.410
Okay, you gotta get that deal closed. And
I want every single thing we asked for.

14:01.412 --> 14:02.494
Are you all right?

14:02.496 --> 14:03.829
I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:03.831 --> 14:05.872
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

14:05.874 --> 14:08.959
I just want what I asked for.

14:08.961 --> 14:12.838
And the most important thing
is cohost approval.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.590
Sarah, I just need to be able
to control the narrative

14:15.592 --> 14:18.218
so that I'm not written out of it.

14:18.220 --> 14:20.429
Alex, why are you afraid of this
all of a sudden?

14:20.431 --> 14:22.014
It's just a feeling.

14:22.016 --> 14:24.558
But it is really, really important.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.643
Cohost approval.

14:26.645 --> 14:29.021
You gotta push that through.
And I mean it.

14:29.023 --> 14:30.605
Get that.

14:30.607 --> 14:33.191
And I wanna hear the minute
that you hear back from them

14:33.193 --> 14:36.486
and not when you feel that I can hear it.

14:36.488 --> 14:37.571
Okay?

14:37.573 --> 14:44.411
Okay.

14:44.413 --> 14:45.495
Yeah. Right.

14:45.497 --> 14:48.373
I never sent a message
that I thought was inappropriate.

14:48.375 --> 14:51.084
These women who have come forward
did think it was inappropriate.

14:51.086 --> 14:55.922
Do you think that that's valid?
Do you think their response is valid?

14:55.924 --> 14:57.758
Of course.

14:57.760 --> 15:01.219
But these women never complained to me
about this behavior.

15:01.221 --> 15:02.721
Yes, but you were their boss.

15:02.723 --> 15:04.931
You were in a position of authority.

15:04.933 --> 15:07.601
Do you think that you created
an environment

15:07.603 --> 15:12.397
where they felt comfortable
coming forward?

15:12.399 --> 15:16.068
Hey. What are you... No, no.

15:16.070 --> 15:18.362
- We can't do this here.
- But, Daddy, I want it now.

15:18.364 --> 15:20.364
- Come on, no.
- Give it to me, Daddy.

15:20.366 --> 15:23.450
- Please, Daddy.
- Come on, no Veruca Salt today. Not here.

15:23.452 --> 15:26.870
- Come on.
- Give me what I want. Give me...

15:26.872 --> 15:28.997
Claire.

15:28.999 --> 15:31.625
- You don't get to say no, remember?
- Claire, please.

15:31.627 --> 15:34.044
You want me to stop,
you're gonna have to use the safe word.

15:34.046 --> 15:38.340
Okay, "climate change."

15:38.342 --> 15:49.893
- You are serious.
- I am. I'm dead serious. All right?

15:49.895 --> 15:51.395
Okay. Come on.

15:51.397 --> 15:54.064
No locked doors, okay? You know
how bad that would look with you...

15:54.066 --> 15:55.941
Couldn't we be having
a private conversation?

15:55.943 --> 15:58.360
- Come on.
- You know, I need advice about my career.

15:58.362 --> 15:59.820
You don't need a locked door for that.

15:59.822 --> 16:02.948
You don't need a locked door
except for one thing.

16:02.950 --> 16:05.575
You know you and I are something
different from... Right?

16:05.577 --> 16:11.039
I know that, and you know that.
Nobody else would know that.

16:11.041 --> 16:15.085
Come on, we have to be so fucking careful.

16:15.087 --> 16:17.629
Or we go to HR right now
and just tell 'em.

16:17.631 --> 16:20.632
Well, that would be mortifying.

16:20.634 --> 16:24.177
I mean, what would it look like?

16:24.179 --> 16:28.557
You mean that I'm having
a serious relationship

16:28.559 --> 16:31.351
with a woman half my age who is the PA?

16:31.353 --> 16:35.856
You think that might seem bad?

16:35.858 --> 16:38.275
What are you saying?

16:38.277 --> 16:40.319
- Hey. What's up? Good morning.
- Morning.

16:40.321 --> 16:42.696
- You ready for me?
- Yeah, of course. Come on in.

16:42.698 --> 16:44.698
Come on and get...
Thank you. You can leave that here.

16:44.700 --> 16:45.782
Oh, yeah. Of course.

16:45.784 --> 16:48.327
Thanks for researching the volcano info.
I really appreciate that.

16:48.329 --> 16:52.247
Yeah, cool. Let me know if anything else
erupts that you need me to do research on.

16:52.249 --> 16:54.791
- Will do. You got it.
- Good.

16:54.793 --> 16:57.419
But more importantly,
and most importantly,

16:57.421 --> 16:59.212
we want to ensure
a safe working environment

16:59.214 --> 17:02.341
for everyone who works
on The Morning Show.

17:02.343 --> 17:05.469
No one here knew what
was going on right under our noses.

17:05.471 --> 17:08.096
The next few weeks are gonna be rough.
We are clearly in triage.

17:08.098 --> 17:11.725
We need to be stabilized
by the time sweeps start. That's in...

17:11.727 --> 17:13.935
- Three weeks.
- Right.

17:13.937 --> 17:16.355
I won't lie to you, we are in a bad place.

17:16.357 --> 17:18.190
Jobs, the show,

17:18.192 --> 17:21.109
the network itself
literally hang in the balance.

17:21.111 --> 17:24.446
- It's not, though.
- These guys, Your Day, America...

17:24.448 --> 17:26.948
Dangerously close to us in the ratings.

17:26.950 --> 17:30.452
And that isn't bullshit, that is ad money.

17:30.454 --> 17:33.747
Ad money that supports this network,
supports your jobs...

17:33.749 --> 17:36.249
supports your families.

17:36.251 --> 17:39.961
We're gonna be working round the clock at
the network to find America's new family,

17:39.963 --> 17:45.175
and I expect all and everything
from each one of you in the meantime.

17:45.177 --> 17:53.433
Great, thank you so much, Fred.
All right, everybody, let's get to it.

17:53.435 --> 17:55.102
Where are we with her deal?

17:55.104 --> 17:57.980
She's holding on cohost approval.
But we're handling it.

17:57.982 --> 18:00.565
Jesus. She's delusional.

18:00.567 --> 18:03.735
Start putting together a list of names,
men who can sit next to Alex for now

18:03.737 --> 18:06.947
and also work with someone younger
once she's gone.

18:06.949 --> 18:09.574
Maybe a couple of women too,
for optics in case it leaks.

18:09.576 --> 18:16.206
Couple of days ahead of you. The list
is already in progress. Anything else?

18:16.208 --> 18:19.001
You know,
when you were assigned the news division,

18:19.003 --> 18:23.547
we didn't know we would be facing
the biggest crisis in our history.

18:23.549 --> 18:28.260
Some people would say
maybe you should have.

18:28.262 --> 18:30.052
I know what you're doing.

18:30.054 --> 18:33.598
The fact that you just started here
doesn't give you the leverage you think.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.311
I'm not looking for leverage, Fred,
I'm just stating the obvious.

18:37.313 --> 18:41.815
It would have been better if we knew,
so we could have stopped it.

18:41.817 --> 18:47.446
But we didn't know. Right?

18:47.448 --> 18:58.574
Right.

18:59.084 --> 19:01.376
- Fucker.
- Hey, I got something good.

19:01.378 --> 19:02.461
Yeah? What's up?

19:02.463 --> 19:07.466
I got some insider info. YDA booked
one of Mitch's victims for next week.

19:07.468 --> 19:09.760
- Who?
- Ashley Brown.

19:09.762 --> 19:12.095
Ashley in sound tech?
Jesus, it's been a while.

19:12.097 --> 19:13.722
You think you can get her back here
after all that?

19:13.724 --> 19:15.849
I'm gonna pull out all the stops.

19:15.851 --> 19:19.186
I know this is huge for us. You have no
idea what I already did to get this info.

19:19.188 --> 19:21.563
You know what? Please don't tell me that.
I really don't want...

19:21.565 --> 19:23.440
Okay, fine.
I found it in a fortune cookie.

19:23.442 --> 19:27.152
Sorry. You're right.
This is obviously huge.

19:27.154 --> 19:32.199
YDA can't be booking one of our victims
for a million fucking reasons.

19:32.201 --> 19:33.700
Do whatever you have to do.

19:33.702 --> 19:34.785
I'm on it, boss.

19:34.787 --> 19:37.287
- Rena.
- Yes?

19:37.289 --> 19:39.873
Where is today's schedule?

19:39.875 --> 19:40.957
I'm looking for it...

19:40.959 --> 19:43.835
You mean this one that says
"today's schedule"?

19:43.837 --> 19:46.129
- Yes. Fuck you very much.
- No problem.

19:46.131 --> 19:48.006
Thank you.

19:48.008 --> 19:50.550
"Seven..." Why are we doing this in sev...

19:50.552 --> 19:52.260
Rena, can you get Mia?

19:52.262 --> 19:54.346
Only seven fucking minutes to do this...

19:54.348 --> 19:56.264
Hey, how you hanging in there?

19:56.266 --> 19:58.308
I can't feel my body I'm so stressed out.

19:58.310 --> 20:01.603
I'm like a brain floating in space
with a phone in my hand.

20:01.605 --> 20:04.815
That sounds about right. Listen,
I want you to meet Bradley Jackson today.

20:04.817 --> 20:09.152
Wait. Bradley Jackson who did the show
yesterday? What the hell for?

20:09.154 --> 20:12.030
We're gonna be grooming
some new people, trying different things.

20:12.032 --> 20:14.366
It is a good time to start
grooming some new people,

20:14.368 --> 20:18.161
and I think she'd be a good correspondent,
possibly.

20:18.163 --> 20:21.748
Yeah. No, I understand it's always good
to be grooming people, but...

20:21.750 --> 20:23.709
I mean, right now?

20:23.711 --> 20:27.087
Plus, you saw her viral video, right?
I mean, a correspondent? I don't...

20:27.089 --> 20:29.339
I did see it.

20:29.341 --> 20:31.508
I saw it,
and so did five million other people,

20:31.510 --> 20:33.927
because it was incredibly
fucking entertaining.

20:33.929 --> 20:36.722
She also went toe-to-toe with Alex Levy.

20:36.724 --> 20:40.517
Not easy to do.
We need to open our minds, Chipper.

20:40.519 --> 20:44.229
Come on. What's worked in the past
isn't working now.

20:44.231 --> 20:49.192
My office set it for 9:30.
Let me know how it goes.

20:49.194 --> 20:56.742
- Great.
- Good.

20:56.744 --> 21:01.788
Yep.

21:01.790 --> 21:05.125
No.

21:05.127 --> 21:08.962
Push back.

21:08.964 --> 21:13.550
No coanchor approval.

21:13.552 --> 21:21.058
It's never gonna happen.

21:21.060 --> 21:25.103
No. We're still on schedule. I'm gonna get
your car to take you for your mani-pedi.

21:25.105 --> 21:26.605
- Okay, good.
- You like Julie, right?

21:26.607 --> 21:28.106
- Yeah, she's fine.
- She does great work.

21:28.108 --> 21:30.734
And is Lizzy all set for after school?

21:30.736 --> 21:33.737
Yes, she is. She's gonna meet you there
and she's very excited.

21:33.739 --> 21:34.821
Okay, good.

21:34.823 --> 21:35.947
- Last looks!
- Hi, good morning.

21:35.949 --> 21:37.199
Revised pages. Here.

21:37.201 --> 21:39.201
- Sarah calling. Now? No?
- Thank you.

21:39.203 --> 21:40.285
- Sorry?
- Here's Sarah.

21:40.287 --> 21:42.329
Oh, yes, now.

21:42.331 --> 21:44.581
Sorry. Thank you.

21:44.583 --> 21:47.751
Hey, Sarah, I'm just about to go on air.
Did they cave?

21:47.753 --> 21:50.003
No. They're sticking to their guns.

21:50.005 --> 21:53.131
No cohost approval.

21:53.133 --> 21:57.844
I'm gonna call you back after the show.

21:57.846 --> 22:09.139
Can you hold that?

22:10.025 --> 22:11.441
Alex, where are you going?

22:11.443 --> 22:13.610
Alex, do you need something?

22:13.612 --> 22:16.446
- Is everything okay?
- I'm all good.

22:16.448 --> 22:19.199
- Okay, well, he can't go from...
- Hey.

22:19.201 --> 22:20.993
What are you doing?
We're live in 90 seconds.

22:20.995 --> 22:23.578
I need to talk to Chip.
I need to talk to you.

22:23.580 --> 22:25.914
What is happening? 'Cause you're supposed
to be on the air in, like, a minute.

22:25.916 --> 22:28.375
- Yeah, listen. Hey, hey...
- What?

22:28.377 --> 22:32.129
I need your word that
you will wrap up my negotiation.

22:32.131 --> 22:33.255
I know you're scared, okay.

22:33.257 --> 22:35.382
The whole Mitch thing has turned
everything upside down...

22:35.384 --> 22:37.968
Can I... Why does no one get this?

22:37.970 --> 22:41.138
The Mitch days... They're over, all right?

22:41.140 --> 22:44.391
I would like hands-on control
from this point on.

22:44.393 --> 22:46.977
I want cohost approval.

22:46.979 --> 22:52.149
Otherwise, I'm not going on the air.

22:52.151 --> 22:54.735
Let's walk to the stage. We'll just walk.

22:54.737 --> 22:56.236
- We can walk.
- We'll walk, okay?

22:56.238 --> 22:58.447
But I'm not going on air
unless you promise me.

22:58.449 --> 23:00.115
- Can I explain something to you?
- Sure.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.825
You pulling this stunt,
with the network right now,

23:01.827 --> 23:03.285
is not gonna make them
promise you anything.

23:03.287 --> 23:05.203
It's gonna make them think
you are fucking losing it.

23:05.205 --> 23:10.834
Well, maybe you have to lose it sometimes
to get people to take you seriously.

23:10.836 --> 23:13.086
I've known you 15 years, Chip.

23:13.088 --> 23:16.757
We came up the ranks together.
For better, for worse.

23:16.759 --> 23:20.052
Lately it's been for worse, but whatever.

23:20.054 --> 23:24.431
You are the only person that I know
that can push this through for me.

23:24.433 --> 23:26.808
And I know if you promise me,
you'll do it.

23:26.810 --> 23:29.561
So, you've gotta promise me, Chip.

23:29.563 --> 23:31.480
Thirty seconds, guys.

23:31.482 --> 23:35.442
I am trying to protect you, but you
are putting me in an impossible situation.

23:35.444 --> 23:38.028
I can't promise you
I can push this through! I can't. I just...

23:38.030 --> 23:41.031
You got Alison and Yanko. Let them go on.

23:41.033 --> 23:42.491
I'm not going on.

23:42.493 --> 23:46.119
And I don't want you to protect me,
I'd like you to respect me.

23:46.121 --> 23:47.996
What, did you read this on a card?
What are you...

23:47.998 --> 23:49.247
Twenty seconds.

23:49.249 --> 23:51.500
I'm ready to fill in.

23:51.502 --> 23:54.503
- There, Alison. There you go.
- No.

23:54.505 --> 23:57.172
They're...
They're gonna think you are crazy.

23:57.174 --> 23:58.715
I'm not going on air.

23:58.717 --> 24:01.051
Ten seconds.

24:01.053 --> 24:03.637
Nine...

24:03.639 --> 24:05.764
eight...

24:05.766 --> 24:07.557
seven...

24:07.559 --> 24:11.853
All right, I promise... Fine, fine!
Go! Sit, butt in chair!

24:11.855 --> 24:18.610
Five, four, three, two...

24:18.612 --> 24:21.279
Good morning. I'm Alex Levy.

24:21.281 --> 24:22.823
And I'm Daniel Henderson.

24:22.825 --> 24:33.834
And here are our top stories.

24:33.836 --> 24:36.795
Hey, Bradley Jackson.

24:36.797 --> 24:39.965
Have a meeting with Charlie Black.

24:39.967 --> 24:42.384
Does he go by Chip, or Charlie, or?

24:42.386 --> 24:45.387
Well, Charlie is his professional name,
but he does go by Chip.

24:45.389 --> 24:53.437
Okay, okay. Well,
then I have a meeting with Charlie Chip.

24:53.439 --> 24:56.606
Hey. Hey, Chip, you looking for me?

24:56.608 --> 24:58.650
Yeah. Can you walk with me?

24:58.652 --> 25:01.194
Second day in the anchor chair,
I think it went pretty well.

25:01.196 --> 25:02.904
I'm really excited about The Twist today.

25:02.906 --> 25:04.906
- Can I give you some advice?
- Sure.

25:04.908 --> 25:07.284
- There are opportunities opening up here.
- Yeah.

25:07.286 --> 25:09.369
You know what Mitch had going for him?

25:09.371 --> 25:12.998
He was that guy you didn't mind being
stuck at the DMV next to, you know.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.084
Easygoing, light touch,
smart, yes, but easy.

25:16.086 --> 25:17.586
Now, I think you're great.

25:17.588 --> 25:20.130
Probably the best real journalist
we have in the building.

25:20.132 --> 25:22.341
But I overheard you having
this debate in the hall.

25:22.343 --> 25:25.218
I know how you feel about
the Gilmore Girls musical

25:25.220 --> 25:28.930
being neo-pro-life rights propaganda,
and I get it.

25:28.932 --> 25:31.308
All I'm gonna say is,
don't fucking say it.

25:31.310 --> 25:34.061
That shit is not gonna get you
the coanchor chair, okay?

25:34.063 --> 25:35.937
You got a lot going for yourself
in this race.

25:35.939 --> 25:38.982
The brass is looking at everybody closely.

25:38.984 --> 25:41.485
Don't ruin it for yourself
by being too serious, okay?

25:41.487 --> 25:47.240
Try being a little... softer.
A little more accessible, you know?

25:47.242 --> 25:49.159
You telling me to be less black?

25:49.161 --> 25:51.286
Jesus, that's what you just heard?
Really, Daniel?

25:51.288 --> 25:52.871
- That's basically what you're saying.
- Fuck...

25:52.873 --> 25:56.249
You don't even know you're saying it. This
is what I had to deal with my whole life.

25:56.251 --> 25:59.461
Don't be smarter than other people. Don't
come off too strong, too opinionated.

25:59.463 --> 26:01.421
Daniel, that's not being black.

26:01.423 --> 26:04.049
It's being fucking Morning Show,
Daniel, okay?

26:04.051 --> 26:08.345
Jesus, I'm on your side here. This has
nothing to do with you being black.

26:08.347 --> 26:11.848
That's what you guys always say.

26:11.850 --> 26:13.350
Shit, okay. You know what?

26:13.352 --> 26:15.936
Just do yourself a favor
tonight at the event.

26:15.938 --> 26:18.313
Press the flesh. Schmooze the executives.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.315
Pretend you're the dad
that everybody wants

26:20.317 --> 26:22.442
and don't go after
the beloved Gilmore Girls.

26:22.444 --> 26:27.030
Hey, hey, this chair could be yours.

26:27.032 --> 26:28.740
Okay?

26:28.742 --> 26:31.326
- I hear you.
- Thank you.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.412
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome. You're welcome.

26:33.414 --> 26:34.663
Yes.

26:34.665 --> 26:37.290
The coal woman is here.

26:37.292 --> 26:39.292
Jesus.
Do we have to do this meeting right now?

26:39.294 --> 26:41.336
Like I don't have a million
more important things to do.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.797
Is Cory Ellison fucking this woman or...

26:43.799 --> 26:46.341
Fucking waste of time. That's it.

26:46.343 --> 26:50.929
I wanna thank you for taking the time to
see me. I know you've got a lot going on.

26:50.931 --> 26:52.973
Sure, it's no problem. Not busy at all.

26:52.975 --> 26:55.267
- I looked at your reel. It was good.
- Thank you.

26:55.269 --> 26:58.687
I noticed you have moved around
last couple of years.

26:58.689 --> 27:02.482
Three years at SENN,
then BDC six months before that...

27:02.484 --> 27:06.069
Yeah, yeah. I understand.
I've been some places.

27:06.071 --> 27:09.197
But really, I'm looking for a platform
where I can get my ideas across.

27:09.199 --> 27:12.826
- Speaking of which, I brought some today...
- Wait, I'm sorry. What do you mean ideas?

27:12.828 --> 27:15.495
I've worked up some stories I think
would be good for The Morning Show.

27:15.497 --> 27:18.665
I'm sorry. I'm maybe a little confused.

27:18.667 --> 27:21.668
You're interviewing to be a correspondent,
right? Not a producer.

27:21.670 --> 27:25.213
'Cause correspondents normally just
present the ideas that producers wrote.

27:25.215 --> 27:28.342
Yeah, I like to do my own producing,

27:28.344 --> 27:31.928
and I think I have some stories
that would do really well on TMS.

27:31.930 --> 27:33.680
So, why don't I just jump in?

27:33.682 --> 27:34.973
Sure, yeah. Okay.

27:34.975 --> 27:37.309
So,
there's a mom-and-pop store in Chicago.

27:37.311 --> 27:39.561
It's about to be replaced by a Target.

27:39.563 --> 27:42.189
The historical society
is trying to block it.

27:42.191 --> 27:43.357
But here's the twist.

27:43.359 --> 27:46.485
The mom and the pop are angry
at the historical society

27:46.487 --> 27:49.196
because they're getting in the way
of them amassing a small fortune.

27:49.198 --> 27:52.074
So, I have a source on the inside
that can tell me...

27:52.076 --> 27:55.118
It's okay. I get the concept.

27:55.120 --> 27:58.455
Okay, well, college admissions.
Not the diversity angle...

27:58.457 --> 28:02.167
Fuck me.

28:02.169 --> 28:03.251
- Sorry.
- College admissions.

28:03.253 --> 28:05.921
But not the diversity angle,
the money angle.

28:05.923 --> 28:07.297
No.

28:07.299 --> 28:10.634
No? Okay.

28:10.636 --> 28:14.012
You know, right here in New York City
they are trying to dedicate a memorial

28:14.014 --> 28:17.474
to the immigrants who died
in the Triangle Fire in 1911.

28:17.476 --> 28:19.434
And the thing about dedicating it
this summer...

28:19.436 --> 28:21.687
You said 1911?

28:21.689 --> 28:24.898
Yeah, that's when it happened, 1911.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.233
Okay.

28:26.235 --> 28:29.653
I don't know how to say this without being
rude, but you're wasting your time here.

28:29.655 --> 28:31.113
Your stories aren't right for us.

28:31.115 --> 28:35.033
It's not even ostensibly what you're here
to discuss anyway, so...

28:35.035 --> 28:37.911
The stories aren't right for you?

28:37.913 --> 28:38.996
I'm sorry.

28:38.998 --> 28:42.290
Were you even listening? 'Cause you look
like you were distracted the entire time.

28:42.292 --> 28:44.209
You didn't even ask me a question.

28:44.211 --> 28:46.128
How are they not right for you?

28:46.130 --> 28:49.214
Are you... You're being serious right now?

28:49.216 --> 28:50.382
Yeah.

28:50.384 --> 28:51.967
Okay.

28:51.969 --> 28:55.429
They're not interesting.
This meeting is over.

28:55.431 --> 28:57.931
You mean they're not interesting to you?

28:57.933 --> 29:00.600
- Have you seen your show lately, sir?
- Please.

29:00.602 --> 29:04.563
I'm sorry, but this week alone,
I think I saw twins who met on Bumble,

29:04.565 --> 29:08.692
a woman got busted for selling
fake emotional support animal licenses.

29:08.694 --> 29:12.863
And how many ice-cream flavors
are there really? Need I go on?

29:12.865 --> 29:14.364
No, you need to leave.

29:14.366 --> 29:16.908
- Your show sucks.
- Thank you! Thank you.

29:16.910 --> 29:18.160
It's barely news.

29:18.162 --> 29:21.246
You have downgraded it to try and get
some of the Your Day, America audience,

29:21.248 --> 29:22.748
to your own detriment.

29:22.750 --> 29:24.750
You really think this is gonna
help you get a job?

29:24.752 --> 29:26.543
The stories that I brought you are good.

29:26.545 --> 29:28.920
They're human, they're political,
they're engaging.

29:28.922 --> 29:31.757
The Triangle Fire story
is so timely right now,

29:31.759 --> 29:33.717
with immigration issues that are going on.

29:33.719 --> 29:37.846
I'm sorry if lives of teenage immigrant
girls burning alive in a sweatshop

29:37.848 --> 29:39.598
holds no current value to you,

29:39.600 --> 29:41.683
but it might lead you to do
an actual news story

29:41.685 --> 29:44.978
about the sweatshops that exist
all over the city right now.

29:44.980 --> 29:49.066
But God forbid you do that at Morning
Show. It's not feel-good bad news, is it?

29:49.068 --> 29:50.776
You want me to call security?
That's what you want?

29:50.778 --> 29:53.070
- Why? Are you scared of me?
- I want you to leave!

29:53.072 --> 29:56.907
You know what? People like you are
the reason broadcast news is what it is.

29:56.909 --> 30:00.827
Thanks for your time, Chip Charlie Chip.
Whatever your fuckin' name is.

30:00.829 --> 30:02.913
You sound like an ice-cream flavor.

30:02.915 --> 30:10.253
Hey, why don't you put that
in your hard news exposé?

30:10.255 --> 30:11.630
What the fuck?

30:11.632 --> 30:25.427
UBA

30:49.878 --> 30:54.006
I'm gonna be straight with you, Mitch.
Financially, this is gonna be tough.

30:54.008 --> 30:56.299
It's okay. It's fine.
I can tighten my belt a little...

30:56.301 --> 30:58.176
It kind of goes beyond that.

30:58.178 --> 31:01.763
UBA is not going to pay out
the rest of your contract.

31:01.765 --> 31:03.265
- They said that?
- Yes.

31:03.267 --> 31:05.934
Legal sent a violation of contract
document this morning

31:05.936 --> 31:07.311
that made it very clear.

31:07.313 --> 31:11.481
How can I be in violation of my contract?

31:11.483 --> 31:13.442
It was consensual.

31:13.444 --> 31:15.986
- All I can say is that for the...
- Lisa, it was consensual.

31:15.988 --> 31:19.990
For the foreseeable future,
you're not gonna have any income.

31:19.992 --> 31:22.951
Okay.

31:22.953 --> 31:24.703
All right.

31:24.705 --> 31:26.496
Well, what do you propose I do?

31:26.498 --> 31:29.041
You're gonna have to start making choices.

31:29.043 --> 31:33.879
You got the Southampton house, the Aspen
property, your New York apartment. Which...

31:33.881 --> 31:36.631
I'm not giving up that apartment.

31:36.633 --> 31:41.053
You could probably keep it going
at this level for two years, tops.

31:41.055 --> 31:45.807
How is that even possible?
I've made more money than God. Right?

31:45.809 --> 31:47.893
God didn't violate his morals clause.

31:47.895 --> 31:50.687
Morals clause, really?

31:50.689 --> 31:52.648
Oh, wow!

31:52.650 --> 31:54.066
Fuck.

31:54.068 --> 31:56.151
That. What a crock of shit.

31:56.153 --> 31:58.445
Morals clause!

31:58.447 --> 32:00.739
These people back up the Brinks truck

32:00.741 --> 32:05.243
and give you everything that
you've always wanted except for one thing:

32:05.245 --> 32:07.788
there's gonna be a morals clause
in your contract.

32:07.790 --> 32:10.832
Okay. Well, you're not an idiot.

32:10.834 --> 32:14.127
And everybody's telling you they
won't trigger it. They never trigger it.

32:14.129 --> 32:16.046
That's not even...
They're just covering their asses.

32:16.048 --> 32:18.924
And these guys? You've known them forever.

32:18.926 --> 32:24.346
You have worked with them. And they
more than approve of your behavior.

32:24.348 --> 32:27.516
It's fine with them,
as is evidenced by the fact

32:27.518 --> 32:32.270
that they just gave you the most lucrative
deal in the history of morning news.

32:32.272 --> 32:34.231
And you don't want
to be that guy who says,

32:34.233 --> 32:37.734
"No, take the morals clause out, then I'll
sign it," 'cause that sends a bad message.

32:37.736 --> 32:40.195
You know what a morals clause is?

32:40.197 --> 32:42.406
It's a moving fucking target!

32:42.408 --> 32:44.491
It's anything they want it to be!

32:44.493 --> 32:49.913
Yeah? It's as the wind blows.

32:49.915 --> 32:54.418
Oh, wow.

32:54.420 --> 33:00.090
Mitch, I'm your business manager,
not your lawyer.

33:00.092 --> 33:12.803
Morals clause. Morals clause.

33:13.063 --> 33:15.480
Rapist!

33:15.482 --> 33:18.859
What did you say to me?
What did you call me?

33:18.861 --> 33:22.321
Don't walk away from me. You're calling me
a ra...? I'm not even accused of rape.

33:22.323 --> 33:24.656
Sexual misconduct
is what I'm being accused of.

33:24.658 --> 33:27.492
Don't you wave your fucking hand at me!

33:27.494 --> 33:39.788
Have a nice day, you fucking asshole.

33:47.348 --> 33:48.597
Yes?

33:48.599 --> 33:50.641
Hi, Ashley. I'm Hannah Shoenfeld.

33:50.643 --> 33:51.933
I'm with The Morning Show.

33:51.935 --> 33:56.146
Don't worry. It's nothing bad. We think
it's great you want to tell your story.

33:56.148 --> 33:58.023
Then why are you here?

33:58.025 --> 34:00.734
Can I come in?
I promise I'll be real quick.

34:00.736 --> 34:06.782
- I really don't think that's a good idea.
- Five minutes. You can time me.

34:06.784 --> 34:08.450
Look, you have a story to tell.

34:08.452 --> 34:12.496
The entire country needs to hear it,
and we want to give you the platform.

34:12.498 --> 34:14.122
On The Morning Show?

34:14.124 --> 34:15.624
Yes.

34:15.626 --> 34:17.709
Why would I ever go back there?
That place is...

34:17.711 --> 34:22.339
The scene of the crime. I know. And going
back, that takes real fucking courage.

34:22.341 --> 34:26.093
Which you have. Or you wouldn't
be speaking out in the first place.

34:26.095 --> 34:30.138
Look, I find stories for a living.
That's what I do.

34:30.140 --> 34:33.976
And when I look at you,
I can see that story.

34:33.978 --> 34:36.645
The brave woman knocked back
by a powerful man,

34:36.647 --> 34:39.523
reclaiming her power on national TV.

34:39.525 --> 34:44.027
But if you go on YDA,
that's not the story that'll be told.

34:44.029 --> 34:48.156
Yes, it is.
It doesn't matter where I tell it.

34:48.158 --> 34:52.703
I am done with this conversation.
I'm not going back there.

34:52.705 --> 34:54.329
Do I have to call security?

34:54.331 --> 34:56.873
Fine. I'll leave.

34:56.875 --> 35:01.628
But it does matter where you tell it.

35:01.630 --> 35:04.673
You're making a huge mistake.

35:04.675 --> 35:05.757
Why?

35:05.759 --> 35:10.554
Because this is television,
not a women's studies seminar at Vassar.

35:10.556 --> 35:14.474
A lot of people watching are gonna
have ignorant, knee-jerk reactions.

35:14.476 --> 35:16.518
How you tell the story
is the whole fucking ball game.

35:16.520 --> 35:22.774
And if you do it on YDA,
you'll be the angry woman.

35:22.776 --> 35:24.109
Why?

35:24.111 --> 35:28.739
Because YDA's our enemy, and everyone
who watches these shows knows it.

35:28.741 --> 35:32.993
They'll see you as a bitch,
scorned by a powerful network,

35:32.995 --> 35:35.370
rejected by a powerful man,

35:35.372 --> 35:38.415
bitter about her career, her life,

35:38.417 --> 35:40.042
looking for a payback,

35:40.044 --> 35:42.210
desperate to hurt the people who hurt her,

35:42.212 --> 35:46.131
manipulated by a rival show that
just wants to fuck over their opponent,

35:46.133 --> 35:48.132
trotted out like a piece of meat,

35:48.134 --> 35:51.469
and then discarded
when you aren't needed anymore.

35:51.471 --> 35:53.429
And then it's done, and nobody cares.

35:53.431 --> 35:55.431
On to the next story.

35:55.433 --> 36:00.145
No, I can't do this.
I mean, I shouldn't be doing this at all.

36:00.147 --> 36:04.190
Yes, you should.

36:04.192 --> 36:06.942
But if you are gonna do it...

36:06.944 --> 36:12.324
if you are gonna blow the whistle on Mitch
Kessler for being the predator he is...

36:12.326 --> 36:16.495
you have to have the balls
to do it in his own house.

36:16.497 --> 36:23.210
It won't mean anything otherwise.

36:23.212 --> 36:26.463
Come on The Morning Show.

36:26.465 --> 36:29.257
Come back to the killing floor.

36:29.259 --> 36:32.719
Show everyone you have the nerve...

36:32.721 --> 36:44.848
but especially him.

36:45.067 --> 36:51.405
Thanks.

36:51.407 --> 36:53.073
- Hello?
- Hello, Bradley.

36:53.075 --> 36:55.993
This is Cecily from Cory Ellison's office.

36:55.995 --> 36:59.454
Cory would like for you to be at the
Leadership in Journalism event tonight.

36:59.456 --> 37:01.665
It's black-tie.

37:01.667 --> 37:04.584
That's really nice,
but I'm headed to the airport.

37:04.586 --> 37:07.713
We'll take care of rearranging
your flight.

37:07.715 --> 37:09.798
A car will pick you up at your hotel.

37:09.800 --> 37:13.010
Okay, I didn't pack anything I could wear
to a black-tie event.

37:13.012 --> 37:15.804
We're sending a few gowns over.

37:15.806 --> 37:17.806
Okay, Cecily, I'm confused.

37:17.808 --> 37:21.560
I had a meeting with Chip Charlie Black,
and it did not go well.

37:21.562 --> 37:23.478
I'm pretty sure he's not hiring me.

37:23.480 --> 37:26.273
All I know is Cory asked me to call you.

37:26.275 --> 37:32.321
So, between you and me, I'd show up.

37:32.323 --> 37:34.448
Okay, yeah. I'll be there.

37:34.450 --> 37:45.534
Fantastic.

37:48.047 --> 37:54.509
Go around the side. Get the shot.
Come out this side.

37:54.511 --> 37:58.472
- Why are you here?
- Is he going back on air?

37:58.474 --> 38:04.144
What's the latest news on Mitch?

38:04.146 --> 38:07.773
Hey, Mitch.

38:07.775 --> 38:09.900
To what do I owe this pleasure?

38:09.902 --> 38:13.195
Is it already time
for my chemical castration?

38:13.197 --> 38:15.238
No,
I got that slotted in for next Thursday.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.657
Oh, yeah.

38:16.659 --> 38:20.577
Maybe we can fit it in between my tar and
feathering and being burnt at the stake.

38:20.579 --> 38:22.329
You got it.

38:22.331 --> 38:28.835
And by the way, fuck you.

38:28.837 --> 38:31.588
Mitch, you gotta stop calling reporters.

38:31.590 --> 38:34.299
Looks like somebody got
an illegal wiretap kit for Christmas.

38:34.301 --> 38:36.051
No, somebody got slipped the information

38:36.053 --> 38:39.012
that Mitch Kessler has been calling
reporters all over New York City

38:39.014 --> 38:42.557
looking for someone to tell
his side of the story.

38:42.559 --> 38:45.268
What the fuck, Mitch?
I mean, you know you can't do that.

38:45.270 --> 38:47.854
You're toxic,
and you're gonna be for a while, so...

38:47.856 --> 38:53.527
How long do I have to sit around
while I take my punishment like a man?

38:53.529 --> 38:57.364
I don't know. I don't know what the
half-life is on this, but it's not a day.

38:57.366 --> 38:58.782
It's years.

38:58.784 --> 39:00.826
So, you need to hibernate.

39:00.828 --> 39:04.454
I have covered enough of these stories
over the past couple of years

39:04.456 --> 39:07.624
to know that when the Me Too mob
comes knocking at your door

39:07.626 --> 39:08.709
you have two choices.

39:08.711 --> 39:14.506
You can either be contrite
and cry puddles of crocodile tears

39:14.508 --> 39:19.011
and pray till you're blue in the balls
that it'll just magically disappear,

39:19.013 --> 39:22.389
or you can fight back.

39:22.391 --> 39:25.350
And that's what I intend to do, Chip.

39:25.352 --> 39:27.644
I think that's my best course of action.

39:27.646 --> 39:29.354
I'm going to hire a new attorney,

39:29.356 --> 39:32.399
I'm going to get my face out there,

39:32.401 --> 39:36.403
and I'm not gonna hide in shame.

39:36.405 --> 39:37.946
It's gonna work.

39:37.948 --> 39:42.284
Do not show your face tonight.
Do not do that to Alex.

39:42.286 --> 39:44.286
My tux is pressed.

39:44.288 --> 39:46.330
- I can't unpress my tux.
- Yeah.

39:46.332 --> 39:50.584
So, I'm going. And those goddamn
two-faced New York reporters...

39:50.586 --> 39:54.129
I'm gonna walk in and look those
motherfuckers in their beady little eyes,

39:54.131 --> 39:57.966
and I'm gonna say,
"I'm here. I can see you."

39:57.968 --> 39:59.217
Yeah, that's suicide.

39:59.219 --> 40:01.887
And by the way, did I see you yelling
at some woman on the street?

40:01.889 --> 40:04.598
Because it's on Twitter.
You can't fucking do this shit, man!

40:04.600 --> 40:07.142
I have to fight back!

40:07.144 --> 40:10.187
I'm not going to let somebody
slander me again in public.

40:10.189 --> 40:12.981
I get it! You're angry! You're upset!
You're defensive, okay?

40:12.983 --> 40:17.903
But I'm telling you, you are way
too emotionally volatile to walk in there

40:17.905 --> 40:20.030
and make a convincing argument, okay?

40:20.032 --> 40:22.616
And you need to drop this innocent act,
at least in front of me.

40:22.618 --> 40:26.203
I am as innocent
as any straight, middle-aged man there is.

40:26.205 --> 40:29.081
The only problem is,
that seems to be illegal these days.

40:29.083 --> 40:31.458
This is McCarthyism, you know it.

40:31.460 --> 40:32.542
Everybody knows it

40:32.544 --> 40:35.671
but people just don't have the intestinal
fortitude to say it out loud.

40:35.673 --> 40:39.132
I'll say it. We're being too fast to judge
men in the court of public opinion.

40:39.134 --> 40:40.592
I agree with you, okay?

40:40.594 --> 40:43.387
The whole Me Too movement
is probably an overcorrection

40:43.389 --> 40:45.055
for centuries of bad behavior

40:45.057 --> 40:47.474
that more enlightened men
like you and me had nothing to do with.

40:47.476 --> 40:52.604
But, Mitch, do you really want
a detailed probe into your private life?

40:52.606 --> 40:55.399
You think that's gonna exonerate you?

40:55.401 --> 40:58.026
- At first they came for the rapists.
- What are you...

40:58.028 --> 41:01.613
And I did not speak up
because I am not a rapist.

41:01.615 --> 41:04.074
And then they came for the powerful men,

41:04.076 --> 41:06.785
and you did not speak up
because you are not a powerful man.

41:06.787 --> 41:08.870
But what are you going to do

41:08.872 --> 41:15.168
when they come for the ordinary, everyday,
run-of-the-mill creep like you, Chip?

41:15.170 --> 41:20.007
Who's gonna be left to speak up for you?

41:20.009 --> 41:24.011
I'm gonna go now, okay?

41:24.013 --> 41:26.304
Do not show up tonight.

41:26.306 --> 41:28.473
Stop talking.

41:28.475 --> 41:33.395
Start fucking listening,
and do it from home.

41:33.397 --> 41:36.064
Who leaked this to the Times?

41:36.066 --> 41:39.818
Stop talking, Mitch.

41:39.820 --> 41:45.240
And who did you have to blow
to keep your job?

41:45.242 --> 41:55.625
All right. See you in a couple of hours.

41:55.627 --> 42:00.964
I need this. I need my makeup
so I can look like a princess all night.

42:00.966 --> 42:03.925
That's not gonna fit. I need my mints.
I need my phone,

42:03.927 --> 42:08.013
and I need my eye drops, none of which fit
in this teeny little thing!

42:08.015 --> 42:09.348
I can take your phone.

42:09.350 --> 42:12.392
Why would you take my phone?
That's ridiculous, Jason.

42:12.394 --> 42:13.977
You're getting worked up about nothing...

42:13.979 --> 42:17.022
Really? About nothing?
I'm sorry. I need all this stupid shit.

42:17.024 --> 42:18.940
Alex, it's fine. Let me just... Give me...

42:18.942 --> 42:21.777
- I said I would get it. I can shut it.
- Jesus Christ.

42:21.779 --> 42:22.778
Thank you.

42:22.780 --> 42:23.862
- Mom?
- What?

42:23.864 --> 42:25.864
- It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not, honey.

42:25.866 --> 42:27.532
Okay, it's just an event.

42:27.534 --> 42:30.035
Really? Just an event?
Only with the worst timing ever.

42:30.037 --> 42:33.038
I would rather stick daggers
into my eyeballs!

42:33.040 --> 42:35.374
- Alex. Alex.
- What?

42:35.376 --> 42:39.836
How about you pretend to have
food poisoning and just don't go?

42:39.838 --> 42:41.922
I cannot do that.

42:41.924 --> 42:45.342
Everyone in there will know that I'm
lying, that I'm uncomfortable and afraid.

42:45.344 --> 42:48.929
That I'm afraid of what's gonna happen
to me on the show in the wake of Mitch.

42:48.931 --> 42:53.141
Everyone in there is press.
They think they know everything.

42:53.143 --> 42:55.018
Half of them hate me
because I'm too successful,

42:55.020 --> 42:57.187
and the other half hate me
because, I don't know,

42:57.189 --> 42:59.606
their hearts are at home in a fucking jar!

42:59.608 --> 43:03.235
Oh, God!

43:03.237 --> 43:05.821
Oh, Jesus, I can't cry!

43:05.823 --> 43:07.864
Jesus!

43:07.866 --> 43:09.533
Oh, God.

43:09.535 --> 43:12.077
- No, stop it, stop it!
- Mom.

43:12.079 --> 43:16.957
- Yeah, well, you can't go out like this.
- I know that!

43:16.959 --> 43:20.210
- Alex, Alex!
- Ms. Levy! Right here!

43:20.212 --> 43:25.298
Hi.

43:25.300 --> 43:26.591
- Okay?
- Yep.

43:26.593 --> 43:41.724
Let's go do this fucking event
so I can go home and just die.

43:52.328 --> 43:58.874
I really appreciate it.

43:58.876 --> 44:01.626
Hey, Alex.
Congratulations on being honored tonight.

44:01.628 --> 44:03.253
- Thank you.
- How does it feel?

44:03.255 --> 44:06.965
It's so meaningful to be honored
by such prestigious company,

44:06.967 --> 44:10.677
and I'm thrilled to be here to support
quality journalism in this day and...

44:10.679 --> 44:15.057
May I just add The Morning Show
is very important.

44:15.059 --> 44:18.060
It's iconic and beloved,
and it is about real journalism

44:18.062 --> 44:19.936
and no one person can change that.

44:19.938 --> 44:22.898
We will survive this disgrace,

44:22.900 --> 44:25.942
and we're gonna help America
get through it like a family.

44:25.944 --> 44:29.655
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

44:29.657 --> 44:33.158
Hey, let's get a picture.

44:33.160 --> 44:36.703
You forgot the part about how I'm the one
that will be pulling America through this.

44:36.705 --> 44:39.790
Well, I think that was implied.

44:39.792 --> 44:42.626
You think a lot is implied.

44:42.628 --> 44:49.216
That's where you hide.
In the implications.

44:49.218 --> 44:52.469
I'm really honored.

44:52.471 --> 44:53.553
Who are you?

44:53.555 --> 44:55.681
Being this personable is exhausting.

44:55.683 --> 44:58.016
I don't think
I can keep doing it for much longer.

44:58.018 --> 45:00.686
Let me take you to the bar
and give you a minute to be an intense,

45:00.688 --> 45:02.896
overly educated, sexy grouch, huh?

45:02.898 --> 45:06.525
I'm feeling good. I'm starting to feel
like I might really have a shot at this.

45:06.527 --> 45:10.320
Keep pressing that flesh.

45:10.322 --> 45:12.114
Hey, Cory?

45:12.116 --> 45:16.451
So, your friend... Bradley Jackson,
bit of a train wreck.

45:16.453 --> 45:19.371
You're gonna be sorry if you go down
this road. I'd like to report otherwise,

45:19.373 --> 45:22.874
but that's my gut feeling.

45:22.876 --> 45:24.584
Fine.

45:24.586 --> 45:30.173
Okay, good.

45:30.175 --> 45:31.883
Mom, did Hal go to his meeting?

45:31.885 --> 45:34.803
He was supposed to call me after,
and I haven't heard a word from him.

45:34.805 --> 45:38.390
I don't know. He's not home yet.
He left about 1:00 to go to it.

45:38.392 --> 45:40.183
He's been out for seven hours?

45:40.185 --> 45:43.687
Well, he said he was gonna
go by Brandon's afterwards.

45:43.689 --> 45:45.689
Mom, you can't let him see Brandon.

45:45.691 --> 45:47.566
That's like putting heroin
right in front of him.

45:47.568 --> 45:49.359
Bradley, I'm worried now.

45:49.361 --> 45:51.862
I'll call you later.
I just have to do one stupid thing

45:51.864 --> 45:54.573
and then I'm gonna come home,
and I'll deal with this myself.

45:54.575 --> 45:56.950
Okay, I gotta go. All right, bye.

45:56.952 --> 45:58.910
- Hey!
- Glad you could make it.

45:58.912 --> 46:00.912
I'm going to show you to your seat.

46:00.914 --> 46:02.748
You got demoted to usher?

46:02.750 --> 46:05.375
No, I just moved you to a different table.
It'll be fun.

46:05.377 --> 46:09.087
Well, it is thrilling to be here
to support Alex Levy tonight,

46:09.089 --> 46:12.299
even though our shows are ratings rivals.

46:12.301 --> 46:14.760
I mean, when it comes to supporting
women in this business,

46:14.762 --> 46:17.637
we're all in the same boat.

46:17.639 --> 46:20.098
What happened to her was humiliating.

46:20.100 --> 46:23.101
I could never show up
at an event like this.

46:23.103 --> 46:25.854
I mean, to work with a sexual predator...

46:25.856 --> 46:27.939
I don't know what I would do.

46:27.941 --> 46:34.321
Thank God that's not me.

46:34.323 --> 46:36.281
- This is my mom.
- Hi.

46:36.283 --> 46:38.617
- Congratulations. Very nice to meet you.
- Thank you. Real nice to meet you.

46:38.619 --> 46:41.036
For the Gram. It's a boomerang.

46:41.038 --> 46:43.038
It is, yeah. That's so cute.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.206
That's fine. It was great.

46:44.208 --> 46:46.708
- Hi, thank you for coming.
- You look gorgeous.

46:46.710 --> 46:48.126
Thank you, so do you.

46:48.128 --> 46:52.047
Congratulations. How are you, honey?
Good to see you.

46:52.049 --> 46:57.135
We should probably take a seat.

46:57.137 --> 46:58.804
- Thank you.
- There we go.

46:58.806 --> 47:00.055
Okay, and you guys are here.

47:00.057 --> 47:04.476
- Yeah. Lizzy's there, and that's where...
- Okay. And you're here.

47:04.478 --> 47:06.019
- I think that's Chip, right?
- I think so.

47:06.021 --> 47:08.605
Chip. Come here.

47:08.607 --> 47:10.983
- What?
- Hi.

47:10.985 --> 47:13.110
- That your seat?
- Yeah. Why?

47:13.112 --> 47:15.278
There's two extra seats here.

47:15.280 --> 47:18.198
Do you think that they forgot
to take away Mitch and Paige?

47:18.200 --> 47:20.534
I hope that's the worst
of our problems tonight.

47:20.536 --> 47:22.577
Why? Why do you say that?
What are our problems?

47:22.579 --> 47:24.287
Nothing, don't worry. I got it.

47:24.289 --> 47:25.872
Chip, you have to...

47:25.874 --> 47:32.546
Hi, gang. You remember Bradley Jackson?

47:32.548 --> 47:34.214
Here's your seat.

47:34.216 --> 47:36.049
This can't be right.

47:36.051 --> 47:39.594
Last I checked
I was the head of the network. It's right.

47:39.596 --> 47:46.101
- Oh, my God.
- Have a seat.

47:46.103 --> 47:47.436
Okay.

47:47.438 --> 47:58.439
Hey.

47:58.699 --> 48:01.742
I'm not with him, with him,
to be very clear.

48:01.744 --> 48:05.329
Well, that's good news for you.

48:05.331 --> 48:07.998
I actually don't even know
what I'm doing here.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.667
Well, that makes two of us.

48:10.669 --> 48:13.420
I didn't wanna bother you. The...

48:13.422 --> 48:20.135
- What are you doing at this table?
- I don't know. Cory Ellison sat me here.

48:20.137 --> 48:21.803
Okay.

48:21.805 --> 48:27.601
Double? Got it.

48:27.603 --> 48:32.564
Cory, did we not just, moments ago, talk
about how Bradley Jackson is a disaster?

48:32.566 --> 48:34.191
We did. That's correct.

48:34.193 --> 48:37.944
So why is she sitting at that table
over there with our people?

48:37.946 --> 48:43.784
I just thought it might be a good
little wake-up call for Alex.

48:43.786 --> 48:55.079
I see.

49:06.767 --> 49:18.477
Take me home, please.

49:22.616 --> 49:24.282
- Alex.
- Hi.

49:24.284 --> 49:26.785
Congratulations. You look gorgeous.

49:26.787 --> 49:29.579
Thank you, Audra. Thank you.

49:29.581 --> 49:33.625
And I'm so sorry about everything.

49:33.627 --> 49:39.506
Why, Audra? I didn't fuck anyone.

49:39.508 --> 49:41.550
Looking forward to your speech.

49:41.552 --> 49:45.303
Thank you.

49:45.305 --> 49:56.064
Oh, God.

49:56.066 --> 50:01.028
Look, I know it's weird that
I'm at the table with you guys. I...

50:01.030 --> 50:04.531
I don't know what Cory's doing,
but I feel really stupid,

50:04.533 --> 50:09.786
and I feel like I've been thrown around
like a yo-yo by these guys all day.

50:09.788 --> 50:12.789
What guys?

50:12.791 --> 50:15.667
Cory Ellison. I met with him last night

50:15.669 --> 50:20.005
and he wanted me to meet Chip Black
about a correspondent position today,

50:20.007 --> 50:25.886
and now I'm here, for what reason, I don't
know, and then they sat me at your table.

50:25.888 --> 50:29.931
He sat you at my table to fuck with me.

50:29.933 --> 50:31.391
Me fuck with you?

50:31.393 --> 50:33.310
I don't think so. That's just funny.

50:33.312 --> 50:38.482
Yeah, it's funny. They're funny.

50:38.484 --> 50:40.150
Let me ask you a question.

50:40.152 --> 50:43.153
- Yeah?
- Why did you stay?

50:43.155 --> 50:46.531
- Stay where?
- At the table.

50:46.533 --> 50:52.037
If it was so uncomfortable for you,
why didn't you leave?

50:52.039 --> 51:00.128
You're an adult, you have agency.
Why did you stay?

51:00.130 --> 51:04.549
I don't have the right to tell
the head of the network to fuck off.

51:04.551 --> 51:06.593
I'm a nobody.

51:06.595 --> 51:17.930
I'm not you.

51:18.148 --> 51:24.861
Well, hello, Alex.
Are you ready for your big speech?

51:24.863 --> 51:28.824
You know what, Cory? Let's just
cut through the second-party bullshit.

51:28.826 --> 51:31.660
I know we're supposed
to go through our agents and legal

51:31.662 --> 51:34.037
and stab each other off-screen,

51:34.039 --> 51:37.874
but I just wanna say this to your face.

51:37.876 --> 51:44.715
I'm not closing without cohost approval.

51:44.717 --> 51:47.968
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
because you're not getting it.

51:47.970 --> 51:50.804
We're not breaking precedent.

51:50.806 --> 51:57.602
I'm not putting the network at risk
for future deals.

51:57.604 --> 52:02.316
Then I'll walk.

52:02.318 --> 52:05.610
Then walk, Alex.

52:05.612 --> 52:11.825
I don't want you to be unhappy.

52:11.827 --> 52:25.331
By the way, we bought this award for you.

52:41.273 --> 52:45.692
Alex Levy is synonymous with integrity.

52:45.694 --> 52:48.487
She embodies the vital role
of our profession,

52:48.489 --> 52:53.742
not just in the politics of the nation
or the business of the nation,

52:53.744 --> 52:58.038
but in the everyday lives
of the American people.

52:58.040 --> 53:00.957
Ladies and gentlemen,
the star of The Morning Show

53:00.959 --> 53:06.421
and this year's recipient of the
Leadership in Journalism Award, Alex Levy!

53:06.423 --> 53:17.841
Come on up.

53:45.754 --> 53:50.173
Thank you. Thank you, Maggie,
for those kind and beautiful words,

53:50.175 --> 53:53.176
and thank you to
the New York Media Foundation

53:53.178 --> 53:56.972
for this tremendous, tremendous honor.

53:56.974 --> 54:00.809
But first, I want to take this opportunity

54:00.811 --> 54:07.649
to apologize to all of the women
who were victimized at The Morning Show.

54:07.651 --> 54:11.820
I am so deeply sorry that we did not see
what was happening,

54:11.822 --> 54:16.199
and truth be told, it feels a bit strange

54:16.201 --> 54:20.996
to be accepting an award
for leadership in journalism

54:20.998 --> 54:26.168
when apparently this was going on
right under our noses.

54:26.170 --> 54:27.753
To that end,

54:27.755 --> 54:39.056
I would like to dedicate
this award to those women.

54:39.058 --> 54:41.600
And secondly, secondly,

54:41.602 --> 54:46.146
this is gonna be a new era
for The Morning Show

54:46.148 --> 54:52.402
and for women, for all women,
and unheard voices.

54:52.404 --> 54:57.658
Things are going to be
quite different from now on.

54:57.660 --> 55:03.580
So, I have some exciting news
to share with all of you tonight.

55:03.582 --> 55:06.958
Get out your phones.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.711
I would like to take this moment

55:09.713 --> 55:15.175
to announce my new Morning Show cohost...

55:15.177 --> 55:26.637
Bradley Jackson.

55:38.620 --> 55:43.620
