02:35.531 --> 02:39.451

my so-called "behavior" under the rug.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.962
What you did sort of took me off guard.

cost you something.

a culture that silenced women.

And he's obviously out for revenge,
in the most base and obvious way.

09:22.437 --> 09:26.900
But in order to accuse Fred, he has to
admit he was part of the problem,

09:27.317 --> 09:30.904

to start an interview from.

that you would say, "Don't do it."

- It's business. God...
- I didn't...

because Mitch was financially beneficial,

they wouldn't step outside the line

I'm assuming that cover is you.

If I wasn't a better journalist,
I'd say, "I know the cover's you."

is how little I care
about losing this fucking job.

Oh.

21:49.685 --> 21:52.521
That launched my career
as a media reporter.

for someone like that.

21:55.232 --> 21:57.609

when you're investigating their mutiny,

you do everything you can to make sure you
have the story perfectly fucking straight.

It's humbling to admit when you were
wrong, but, um, I care about this show...

22:34.021 --> 22:37.191
just too much to let my bruised ego
get in the way.

22:37.274 --> 22:39.502
I mean, that's what led me
to choose Bradley in the first place,

22:39.526 --> 22:45.532
and obviously that has put us in
a very dangerous situation. All of us.

22:45.949 --> 22:48.577

to an interview with Mitch?

22:48.660 --> 22:50.704
Yes, I know. She did.

And she thinks that Mitch has something
that could credibly take you down.

I don't know, Fred. I...

I think I kinda lost my mind.

that what I'm about to say to you

very dangerous to the well-being

Yeah. And he's a real charming
piece of shit.

to make himself the victim

24:04.945 --> 24:06.321

24:06.405 --> 24:07.781
That sounds like boring TV to me.

24:07.865 --> 24:11.118
I agree. But he also claims
to have evidence

24:11.201 --> 24:14.371
that Fred Micklen silenced women
that he slept with.

24:15.414 --> 24:17.207
He wants to topple the king.

that is definitely of interest to me.

Maybe you'll perceive this as convenient.
I wouldn't blame you.

24:31.555 --> 24:34.892
There was something about Mitch
that always bothered me.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.643
Hmm.

24:36.727 --> 24:39.062
I would have dinner with him, play golf,
visit the show.

24:39.146 --> 24:42.482
I would... leave his presence and go home

24:42.566 --> 24:45.569
and be so deeply relieved to see Geneva.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.780
I had this fear that I had somehow,

24:49.198 --> 24:53.035
you know, sullied myself
just by being brought into his orbit.

24:54.411 --> 24:58.707
Now, if I had one regret,
it wasn't following that gut instinct

24:58.790 --> 25:01.335
that something about him was off.

25:02.252 --> 25:06.048
And letting myself believe, even for
a second, you were part of the problem.

25:07.007 --> 25:10.260
And that's why I was so angry
when you turned on me.

25:11.178 --> 25:14.056
It was partially anger at myself.

Okay. All right, well,
just so you have all the facts,

25:32.366 --> 25:36.537

and told Alex Levy before I told you.

Oh, no. And that go well?

Um, no, it did not go great. She is
terrified mainly because she's guilty.

"But everybody knows there's a boys' club,

25:45.754 --> 25:48.841
and that there's this silencing,
sexist culture. It just exists."

25:48.924 --> 25:49.925

she's the only survivor of the boys' club.

Yeah.

I'm sorry, but there's a difference
between going to HR

- No, no, I... No, I get it.

interrogated by a woman named Sheila

29:36.860 --> 29:38.445
about my sex life was delightful.

29:38.529 --> 29:41.573
I highly recommend it
if you never wanna feel horny ever again.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.117
Okay, I wish that hadn't happened.

29:44.201 --> 29:46.745
But, at the end of the day,
we did the right thing.

29:47.454 --> 29:51.166
And declaring ourselves to Sheila and HR
doesn't mean that we have to go on air

29:51.250 --> 29:52.626
and scream it to the masses.

29:52.709 --> 29:56.129
I mean, we can just take our time
and just ease into it.

29:56.213 --> 29:59.424
How exactly? I mean,
it feels like an either-or scenario.

30:00.133 --> 30:04.096
Look, let me take you out to dinner.
Come on. We can celebrate.

30:04.763 --> 30:06.765
Outside the confines of my apartment,

30:06.849 --> 30:09.935
but not where we have to explain ourselves
to our colleagues.

30:10.018 --> 30:11.645
And it'll be a real date.

30:13.564 --> 30:15.357
Wouldn't that be, like, our first date?

30:16.441 --> 30:18.610
I think, technically, yeah, it would be.

30:19.111 --> 30:22.391
Are you the kind of guy who would judge me
for sleeping with you on the first date?

30:22.447 --> 30:24.366
No, but "Daddy" will.

30:29.329 --> 30:30.330
- Not here.
- I accept.

30:30.414 --> 30:31.665
Okay, go. Go.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.460
Then a short time after that,

30:35.544 --> 30:39.256
Bradley will be given a very compelling
news story that she'll cover on remote.

30:39.339 --> 30:41.258
And we all know
how Bradley loves a remote.

30:41.341 --> 30:43.719
Then you and I will have to hold down
the home front.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.512
And it will go so well,

30:45.596 --> 30:49.641
we will tell the press
that we are just trying out a new format.

30:50.058 --> 30:51.852
Then she'll spend more time away,

30:52.269 --> 30:56.315
and the audience will get used to
our faces waking them up every morning,

30:56.398 --> 30:59.359
and then, eventually,
an announcement will be made.

30:59.443 --> 31:02.446
"While Bradley has enjoyed her tenure
at The Morning Show,

31:02.529 --> 31:07.159
she's realized that her true passion lies
in field reporting."

31:07.576 --> 31:12.748

They vet people for my job
every year, honestly.

of abuse.

- Thank you.

34:13.512 --> 34:16.514
I just wish we could go public
on our own terms. HR's awful.

34:16.598 --> 34:19.643
They managed to make me feel
like both a victim and a criminal.

34:22.646 --> 34:25.315
Well, I understand they need to be careful
in the wake of Mitch.

34:25.399 --> 34:29.652
Yeah. No, I know. I agree.
I'm just saying that Yanko's not Mitch.

34:30.737 --> 34:33.114
But you don't feel comfortable
going public with him?

34:33.197 --> 34:35.951
No. No, but not because he's predatory.

34:36.034 --> 34:38.704
Because he's best known
for his passionate stance on hail.

34:39.246 --> 34:42.248
Look, no one else gets him like I do.
No one would understand.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.502

34:46.920 --> 34:49.755
Oh, Jesus.
I think I'm embarrassed about dating him.

34:50.882 --> 34:53.135
Well, great.
Then you have your answer, don't you?

34:53.217 --> 34:56.638
It's not that easy, Hannah.
I love him... a whole fucking lot.

34:56.722 --> 34:57.931
Except you're embarrassed.

34:58.015 --> 34:59.892
Yeah, because I'm worried
about being judged.

34:59.975 --> 35:03.187
Kinda like how I feel you're judging me
right now. What the fuck?

35:04.271 --> 35:06.940
Look. I know you think you love him,
but, at the end of the day,

35:07.024 --> 35:10.777
it's a transitory chemical feeling
that's not worth losing your career over.

Are you serious?

35:14.907 --> 35:15.949

I saw you guys together in LA,
sneaking around.

35:22.581 --> 35:26.627
I'm the one who reported you
for exactly this reason.

35:26.710 --> 35:30.339
It's hurting you. It will keep
hurting you. It's just not good.

35:30.422 --> 35:32.674
- You reported us?
- I had to.

35:32.758 --> 35:35.844
Well, you didn't think to ask me
about it first?

I did, but I was afraid of you

35:39.765 --> 35:44.019
feeding me some line about love
that would make me feel empathetic.

35:44.645 --> 35:45.896
And it needed to be done.

35:45.979 --> 35:49.191
I have a higher-up position at work.
I have a responsibility.

But we're friends. We're friends, right?

how human interaction works?

You're so young.
You have so much potential.

People take advantage of that.

36:06.458 --> 36:09.795
There're a lot of men who care more about
their own power than they do about you.

36:09.878 --> 36:12.506
Okay. How dare you judge me
and my relationship.

36:12.589 --> 36:15.592
And how dare you fucking report me to HR.

36:15.676 --> 36:17.946
Listen, feel as self-righteous
and mad as you want. I get it.

36:17.970 --> 36:21.849
But things like this,
they aren't just what they seem.

36:23.183 --> 36:25.644
I'm just saying there are consequences.

36:27.271 --> 36:30.357
And you can't see
what you're doing right now.

36:32.150 --> 36:33.861
I was trying to do you a favor.

I don't care if you hate me. I don't.

36:38.532 --> 36:39.908

but it's clearly not mine.

You know what? Thank you. No, you actually
did me a huge, huge fucking favor.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.169
You made me realize why I love Yanko.

36:50.252 --> 36:53.189

in this world who actually understands me,

36:53.213 --> 36:54.923
