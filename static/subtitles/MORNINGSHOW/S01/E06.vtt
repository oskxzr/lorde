Hi. [CHUCKLES]

15:27.553 --> 15:28.933
Oh. Thank you.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.572
We're working on the press conference
with the Malibu fire chief.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.060
Then we have the children
who survived in the swimming pool.

Do we have anyone from the hospital yet?

15:36.645 --> 15:39.225
The nurse is a little skittish.
I'm working on her.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.404
I'll have a backup too.

15:40.482 --> 15:43.282
Okay. We still need an upbeat story
to wrap up with.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.990
I'm leaning towards the Good Samaritan
who rescued all the dogs.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.912
Oh, uh...
don't you think that's a little bit soft?

15:50.325 --> 15:52.905
I mean, I like dogs.
But just to end the show?

15:52.995 --> 15:55.365
Well, maybe
one of the dogs had an abortion.

16:00.335 --> 16:01.915
Um, what'd you have in mind, Bradley?

16:02.504 --> 16:05.884
I don't know, maybe something about
the allocation of firefighting resources,

16:05.966 --> 16:08.256
how they prioritize
which homes they wanna save.

16:08.343 --> 16:11.513
- Hmm.
- The numbers seem to show an imbalance

16:11.597 --> 16:13.717
towards richer neighborhoods
over poor neighborhoods.

16:13.807 --> 16:17.137
And maybe that's an unconscious bias,
and maybe it's outright corruption,

16:17.227 --> 16:19.187
but either way, it's wrong.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.821
Claire actually found a video on Twitter.

16:21.899 --> 16:26.199
Some celebrities hire private firefighters
to protect their mansions.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.278
Oh, that's kind of an interesting take.

about what this show means.

from the terrible Woolsey Fire

18:40.495 --> 18:42.325

In the mythology of most ancient cultures,
fire was imbued with magical properties.

It's referred to as a creature
to be tamed.

when you see a fire like this,

19:26.250 --> 19:27.460

it seems deliberate, like it's something
with a mind that can think and plan.

up on the screen.

22:10.163 --> 22:14.083
That is an accurate representation of

Sometimes a guy,
he bounces around the minors,

22:36.106 --> 22:39.106
he's barely hitting his own weight,
and everybody has called him a washout.

22:39.193 --> 22:44.493
But you, you see something in him,
so you empower him.

22:44.573 --> 22:47.663
You call him up to the majors,
and the first fucking pitch he sees,

22:47.743 --> 22:53.293
he crushes a 500-foot towering home run
over the center-field wall.

It's beautiful. He's a gamer.

decent numbers in Triple-A.

He strikes out on three straight pitches.

And then it happens again.

then you could quickly

To be honest, I've never done anything
like this before, okay?

25:52.511 --> 25:55.431
But these things have a way
of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

is going to succeed Fred Micklen.

I like your chances.

at our show, obviously,

saved up,

27:24.603 --> 27:26.523
[MIA]
That's on the C block. That's C block.

27:30.901 --> 27:33.651
You don't have to wear the mask,
but you have to take it.

27:33.737 --> 27:35.407
- Just take it.
- Yeah.

27:35.489 --> 27:37.449
Oh, I'll help.

27:37.533 --> 27:39.373
Take these and pass them out.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.888
Hey, can you give one of these to Bradley?
She's in her trailer.

27:41.912 --> 27:44.922
Then we can put that in. That'll fit.
Does that work for you, Yanko?

27:44.998 --> 27:47.560
- It's not about me. It's about the fires.
- Apparently you minded about... What?

27:47.584 --> 27:49.312
- [MIA] That looks good. I like that.
- [YANKO] Okay. All right.

27:49.336 --> 27:50.586
That's all I can do.

27:51.380 --> 27:52.800
[CLAIRE SIGHS]

27:57.678 --> 27:58.718
Mask.

27:59.513 --> 28:02.563
Um, Bradley, I'm supposed to give you
a mask. It's network policy.

28:02.641 --> 28:03.851
Oh, hey, thanks.

28:03.934 --> 28:07.234
Did you find this article about the actor
that hired the private firefighters?

28:07.312 --> 28:08.942
Yeah, that was me.

28:09.022 --> 28:13.782
This is great stuff. This is fascinating.
Really fucked-up, but fascinating.

28:13.861 --> 28:14.861
Thanks.

28:14.945 --> 28:17.235
Yeah, if you find
another fucked-up story like this,

28:17.322 --> 28:18.642
don't hesitate to bring it to me.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.909
- Oh. Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

28:20.993 --> 28:22.373
- I will.
- Thanks.

28:23.203 --> 28:25.583
- Claire?
- Yes.

28:26.164 --> 28:28.044
What are your goals around here?

28:28.125 --> 28:31.625
Oh, uh, well, to be completely honest,
I'm still feeling it out.

28:31.712 --> 28:35.722
I mean, I'm fascinated by so much of it.
Like, maybe on-air, maybe an EP.

28:35.799 --> 28:38.199
I mean, also I can just see myself
running an entire network.

28:40.554 --> 28:43.274
Okay, well, um,
I've been interviewing assistants.

28:44.349 --> 28:45.679
How's that going?

28:45.767 --> 28:47.347
You know, to be honest, not great.

28:47.436 --> 28:49.706
They just keep sending me
the same cookie-cutter, Ivy League...

28:49.730 --> 28:54.400
Hire me! I'm extremely smart.
I'm incredibly hardworking.

28:54.484 --> 28:57.154
I already know everything about the show
and how to get shit done.

28:57.237 --> 28:59.527
But mainly,
I really want to learn from you.

29:00.115 --> 29:02.945
I realize you maybe weren't remotely
going to offer me the job,

29:03.035 --> 29:04.715
and I apologize
if I just mortified myself.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.366
But I really do mean all of that.

29:07.539 --> 29:09.629
Did you see how many bridges
I burned last week?

29:09.708 --> 29:11.418
Yeah, and I really admire it.

29:12.085 --> 29:15.665
Okay. You're funny,
and you have questionable taste,

29:15.756 --> 29:18.506
but I like that you just come out
and say what you want.

29:18.592 --> 29:21.552
So I think I wanna offer you the job.

29:22.054 --> 29:23.564
- Really?
- Yeah, if you want it.

29:23.639 --> 29:25.469
Yes! Should I just start now?

29:26.517 --> 29:30.267
I would pass out the face masks, then come
back and we can start talking about work.

29:30.354 --> 29:32.814
Amazing. Thank you.
I will not let you down.

29:32.898 --> 29:34.068
I know you won't.

29:40.531 --> 29:41.991
- Guess what?
- Hey.

29:42.533 --> 29:44.243
I just got promoted.

29:44.326 --> 29:45.366
What? You did?

29:45.452 --> 29:49.752
You are now having an affair with
Bradley Jackson's executive assistant.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.791
Come on, Claire. Come on. Please.

29:52.209 --> 29:55.129
Look, it's great news,
no, but use your head.

29:55.212 --> 29:59.552
Okay. I understand. I do.
[CHUCKLES]

30:04.263 --> 30:05.813
I'm proud of you.

30:05.889 --> 30:07.219
Me too.

30:08.267 --> 30:09.267
Oh.

30:09.893 --> 30:11.143
Yes. Yeah.

30:12.271 --> 30:17.361
You look very sexy out here in the wild,
you know. It's unbearable.

30:17.442 --> 30:20.492
- Go away. Now.
- [GIGGLES]

30:21.613 --> 30:24.243
Look up. Close your eyes.

30:24.324 --> 30:28.004
Look, Alex, I get that you're upset at me
ever since that Ashley interview.

30:28.078 --> 30:32.288
Oh, God, Bradley.
My life is not all about you.

30:32.374 --> 30:35.061
- I'm sorry if what I asked you was rude.
- [MAN] Guys, I got Mike from an old...

30:35.085 --> 30:37.795
Rude? Rude?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.460
[GREG] Clear the set, please!

30:40.966 --> 30:44.966
Implying that I'm part
of a conspiracy of silence?

30:47.222 --> 30:48.522
How could that be rude?

30:48.599 --> 30:52.059
Fine. I got all heated up.
It was a question.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.234
My journalistic instinct
told me to ask you.

30:54.313 --> 30:57.823
Oh, that's so grand.
Your curiosity just thrills me.

30:57.900 --> 31:01.360
And I'm in awe of your instincts.
Can we just be honest?

31:01.445 --> 31:02.355
Please.

31:02.446 --> 31:04.816
- I don't like you, and you don't like me.
- I like you.

31:04.907 --> 31:07.487
Oh, come on. Why?
Why are we p... Stop pretending.

31:07.576 --> 31:09.236
Because we have to work together.

31:09.328 --> 31:11.458
Yes, I know we are in this mess now.

31:11.914 --> 31:15.464
But doing this job well requires us
to act like best friends

31:15.542 --> 31:17.462
for exactly two hours a day.

31:17.544 --> 31:20.804
The rest of the time,
we just have to be professional adults

31:20.881 --> 31:23.091
who can tolerate being in the same room.

31:23.175 --> 31:25.055
And I think we can both handle
those boundaries.

31:25.093 --> 31:27.393
I know I can. See if you can.

31:27.888 --> 31:29.518
Come on, Greg! What's happening?

31:29.598 --> 31:32.558
Yeah, we're live in 30 seconds, everyone.
Quiet on the set.

31:32.643 --> 31:33.733
[ALEX] Shit.

31:33.810 --> 31:36.150
[ALEX]
Okay, come on, sound, mikes, let's go.

31:36.230 --> 31:38.110
Here. Who's taking my coat?

31:40.359 --> 31:41.649
We're live in ten.

31:43.153 --> 31:46.533
Jesus, you can't buy this kind
of production value. Holy shit.

31:46.615 --> 31:48.259
- [BRADLEY] Which camera do we start with?
- Standby, two.

31:48.283 --> 31:50.083
- [ALEX] Oh, my God.
- Take it, two. Cue her.

31:50.786 --> 31:52.656
In three, two...

31:55.165 --> 31:57.455
Good morning,
and thank you for joining us.

31:57.543 --> 31:59.646
We're coming to you live
from both coasts this morning

31:59.670 --> 32:03.300
with special coverage of the Huntley Fire
that has devastated California this week.

32:03.382 --> 32:04.632
Alex, Bradley.

32:05.050 --> 32:07.800
Good morning, guys.
Bradley and I are currently standing

32:07.886 --> 32:10.346
in the Santa Monica Mountains
near Huntley Canyon,

32:10.430 --> 32:13.600
where the blaze began,
and the destruction is devastating.

32:14.601 --> 32:16.141
Here's what we know right now.

32:16.228 --> 32:19.268
Seven people are confirmed dead
and dozens are injured,

32:19.356 --> 32:23.026
including four firefighters
who are being treated in area hospitals.

32:23.527 --> 32:25.527
At least 40,000 acres have burned,

32:25.612 --> 32:30.242
and local officials estimate
that close to 1,500 homes have been lost.

32:30.325 --> 32:32.325
[ALEX] And those numbers
are still going up

32:32.411 --> 32:34.041
as the fire continues to rage,

32:34.121 --> 32:37.421
only 10% contained at this hour.

32:37.499 --> 32:41.749
100,000 residents have been forced
into mandatory evacuations.

32:41.837 --> 32:45.167
It's difficult to wrap your mind
around the human toll.

32:45.674 --> 32:48.264
It really is, Alex.
It's... It's harrowing.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.297
Wow. So awful.

32:50.387 --> 32:53.347
Well, we hope that both of you
are staying safe out there.

32:53.682 --> 32:54.732
Thank you, guys.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.475
It's intense being here
in the middle of all this,

32:57.561 --> 32:59.981
but we're watching out for each other.

33:00.063 --> 33:03.693
Yes, we are.
Now let's go to a live news conference

33:03.775 --> 33:07.105
with Los Angeles County Fire Chief,
Captain Graham Sealy,

33:07.196 --> 33:09.526
for an update on the rescue effort.

33:09.615 --> 33:11.695
- And we're out.
- All right. It's good.

33:32.054 --> 33:33.144
Mm.

33:36.558 --> 33:37.558
Here.

33:38.101 --> 33:39.601
- Oh, thanks.
- You okay?

33:39.686 --> 33:42.436
Yeah. I'm fine.
It's just the smoke. It's...

33:45.025 --> 33:46.435
It's the smoke. I'm fine.

33:46.527 --> 33:47.527
Okay. All right.

33:47.611 --> 33:49.661
Uh, dog guy's on next, all right?
Five minutes.

33:49.738 --> 33:50.738
Okay.

33:51.823 --> 33:55.793
Oh, come on. Okay.
You got to really get there, okay?

33:57.079 --> 34:00.579
[GREG] All right, everyone,
we're live in five, four...

34:03.669 --> 34:06.209
We are here live with Tim Eavers.

34:06.296 --> 34:08.126
Welcome to The Morning Show, Tim.

34:08.215 --> 34:10.295
Thanks so much
for being here with us today.

34:10.384 --> 34:11.443
Oh, it's my great pleasure.

34:11.467 --> 34:15.757
I've been watching you for the past
15 years through every major emergency,

34:15.848 --> 34:17.808
and, uh, I'm a huge fan.

34:17.891 --> 34:19.811
I watched your daughter grow up
on the show.

34:19.893 --> 34:22.403
- Oh, that's great. Thank you.
- Yeah.

34:22.478 --> 34:25.148
She's quite the grown woman these days.

34:25.232 --> 34:27.532
- Color me an empty nester, you know?
- [TIM CHUCKLES]

34:28.694 --> 34:31.494
[BRADLEY] So, Tim,
this is an incredible act of heroism.

34:31.572 --> 34:34.282
How many dogs
have you rescued altogether now?

34:34.366 --> 34:36.906
- Uh, eighteen. And two cats.
- Wow. That's incredible.

34:36.994 --> 34:40.414
Wow. So, Tim, take us back to that moment.

34:40.914 --> 34:45.344
So once I realized that my wife
had picked up my daughter from school,

34:45.418 --> 34:47.588
and they were safely situated in a motel,

34:47.670 --> 34:51.050
- I went home to get treasured items...
- This guy Tim is great.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.142
And to pick up our, um...
our two family dogs,

34:54.219 --> 34:59.269
Marge, who's an old Lab,
and Tilly, who is her own puppy.

34:59.975 --> 35:03.395
Oh, that's so sweet. So you kept
the mother-daughter relationship intact.

35:03.478 --> 35:05.768
Oh, yeah, you don't wanna be
busting up a family.

35:06.356 --> 35:09.776
[WHIMPERS, COUGHS]

35:09.860 --> 35:13.240
The smoke is really... Excuse me.

35:13.322 --> 35:14.822
What... What was that?

35:14.907 --> 35:17.157
Yes, there is a lot of smoke out here.

35:17.242 --> 35:20.832
So, Tim, once you got the dogs in the car,
then what happened?

35:20.913 --> 35:23.793
Uh, well, so at that point, you know,
the fires were pretty close,

35:23.874 --> 35:24.893
so there was a lot of sirens.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.747
And dogs were just barking everywhere.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.745
And that's when I realized,

35:28.837 --> 35:32.087
man, there was a lot of people
like my wife and my daughter

35:32.174 --> 35:34.554
- who were at work and at school.
- [ALEX SNIFFLES]

35:34.635 --> 35:36.755
So I just started driving
around the neighborhood

35:36.845 --> 35:38.805
and checking all these different yards

35:38.889 --> 35:40.889
and finding all these dogs
that got left behind.

35:40.974 --> 35:43.274
[SOBS]

35:44.394 --> 35:47.064
Oh, hey, Greg,
let's move on to the strays now.

35:47.147 --> 35:49.017
Okay, and now the strays.

35:49.483 --> 35:50.783
Yes. Okay.

35:51.527 --> 35:55.697
So, Tim, we have four of the dogs
here today that you've rescued.

35:56.532 --> 35:58.782
Let's...
Tell us a little bit about these big guys.

35:58.867 --> 36:05.617
Okay, so these guys are from a family
who, sadly, their home burnt down.

36:05.958 --> 36:10.458
I know that nobody likes feeling alone,
you know?

36:10.546 --> 36:16.466
So, if someone out there is suffering
or in emotional pain, or needs a family,

36:16.552 --> 36:19.142
they might want to adopt
one of these little angels.

36:19.221 --> 36:20.931
I wanna give you a home.

36:21.014 --> 36:22.854
Greg, what the fuck
is happening right now?

36:22.933 --> 36:24.353
She's about to lose it.

36:24.434 --> 36:26.984
It looks like this one
might have found a home already.

36:27.771 --> 36:31.191
- Isn't that right, Alex?
- It's just so emotional, everything today.

36:31.275 --> 36:34.185
What you're doing, it's just...
it's beautiful.

36:34.278 --> 36:36.948
- We're gonna get through this together.
- Mm-hmm.

36:37.030 --> 36:39.342
- And God is gonna help us.
- Donny, no more close-ups on Alex.

36:39.366 --> 36:41.094
- Go right to Bradley. Stay on her.
- And cut off her mike.

one of these incredible dogs,

on our website.

- That was great, okay? Thank you.
- Can I get that...

37:14.067 --> 37:15.987
Can I get that picture with her, or...

- What's going on?
- [CHIP] You got to get in there,

37:24.912 --> 37:26.389
- you got to do something.
- I think she just needs five minutes.
