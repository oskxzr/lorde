01:16.034 --> 01:19.913
Oh, God. Fred, what happened?

01:24.877 --> 01:26.086
So, that's it?

01:28.005 --> 01:32.301
Motherfuck, we're destroyed. [panting]

01:34.553 --> 01:35.721
No, I'll tell him.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.126
Shit.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.092
[sighs]

03:47.394 --> 03:49.855
[man 1] Following that,
you'll interview Gerard Thompson,

03:49.938 --> 03:54.067
Art Department at Vanderbilt,
to discuss a recently resurfaced Van Gogh.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.361
[man 2] I'm scheduling an hour to go over
your speech for Friday night.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.615
I think it's gonna run over though. I'm
gonna push your drinks with Jane Fonda.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.699
[man 1] Next up,

04:00.782 --> 04:03.327
you'll interview the senator
to discuss her book on policy-making

04:03.410 --> 04:04.411
and why it's broken.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.872
[man 2] You need to do your
final fitting for your gown for Friday.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.957
They're gonna bring it
to the studio today.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.668
[man 1] And if you ever want
the senator on the show again--

04:12.669 --> 04:15.005
[man 2] You have a parent-teacher night
at Lizzy's school next week.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.216
[man 1] Chip's trying to get ahold of you.
Something urgent.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.718
[man 2 faint, indistinct]

04:51.750 --> 04:52.793
Oh, my God.

04:53.752 --> 04:54.753
Who died?

04:54.837 --> 04:59.174
["American Pie" plays on radio]

05:08.892 --> 05:10.727
Oh, my God.
Jesus, would you turn this off?

05:10.811 --> 05:11.812
[music stops]

05:11.895 --> 05:14.189
He's been singing about the same fucking
plane crash the past 50 years.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.316
Everybody's still dead. Time to move on.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.860
-Am I right, Joe?
-Yep.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.695
Hey, watch the bumps.
I'm doing my eyeliner.

05:19.778 --> 05:20.946
I'm--

05:21.029 --> 05:23.448
And, Alan, what is this anyway?
What is this bullshit?

05:23.532 --> 05:25.450
What exactly is bullshit this time?
What is it?

05:25.534 --> 05:29.079
This stupid idea that we're gonna convince
the world's coal-fired power plants

05:29.162 --> 05:31.039
to invest in carbon capture
without linkage.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.500
Oh, my God, Jesus. Can we please
not have this linkage debate again?

05:33.584 --> 05:34.585
-What?
-It's not about linkage.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.128
This is about a protest
and how the town is divided.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.504
-That's what this is about.
-Yes, I know.

05:37.588 --> 05:38.964
Who went through all the burgers?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.924
-No.
-Here, Joe. Have my french fries.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.342
-Thank you.
-They're cold, but don't complain.

05:42.426 --> 05:43.969
How many burgers did you eat, Joe?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.722
By the way, okay, so we're
gonna talk about how the town's divided.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.850
But we're also gonna slip in
how safe carbon capture is.

05:49.933 --> 05:50.934
Mm-hmm.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.020
What? You put it in the copy.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.397
This is not my agenda, Bradley, okay?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.900
I'm just a liberal Harvard longhair
who cut his hair short for this job.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.651
This is a stepping-stone for me.
I play by the rules.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.612
The truth is the truth, whether you're
writing for The Bumfuck Gazette

06:01.695 --> 06:02.779
-or The New York Times.
-Shit.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.031
-I hope we made the right turn.
-By the way,

06:04.114 --> 06:06.992
that was an award-worthy shoehorning of
the word "Harvard" into the conversation.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.327
[Alan] Okay, you guys, can we please--

06:08.410 --> 06:11.997
I swear, Joe. Everybody who's ever been to
Harvard can make an entire conversation

06:12.080 --> 06:14.208
out of the word "Harvard,"
like, "Harvard, Harvard, Harvard?"

06:14.291 --> 06:16.293
-Harvard, Harvard, Harvard.
-[laughs]

06:16.376 --> 06:18.504
Are we gonna keep doing this?
How long is this gonna go on for?

06:18.587 --> 06:21.840
Holy shit. Mitch Kessler just
got fired off The Morning Show.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.759
-What?
-Wait, what? What the hell happened?

06:23.842 --> 06:24.843
[Joe] Let me see.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.971
One less idiot to peddle soft news
to the masses.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.432
[woman] Prior to being named coanchor
of The Morning Show,

06:30.516 --> 06:33.435
the fallen Kessler was a fixture
of UBA's news division,

06:33.519 --> 06:35.687
serving as UBA's
White House correspondent,

06:35.771 --> 06:39.399
a presidential debate moderator
and network field correspondent.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.610
The recipient
of multiple broadcast awards,

06:41.693 --> 06:44.863
including a Leadership in Journalism award
from the New York Media Foundation

06:44.947 --> 06:49.743
he and the TMS team have won
12 Daytime Emmys in their 15-year tenure.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.788
Late last night, The New York Times
was reportedly tipped off

06:52.871 --> 06:56.917
to an internal investigation by UBA
into Kessler's sexual misconduct.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.838
Up until today, The Morning Show
was the only morning news broadcast

07:00.921 --> 07:04.007
to dodge the Me Too scandals that have
seemingly plagued its competitors.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.426
-When?
-Just broke. Does she know yet?

07:06.510 --> 07:10.931
She knows. We're reworking the whole show.
We are live in 90 minutes.

07:11.014 --> 07:14.518
Buckle up. Layla's working on new copy.
Get it to Alex A.S.A.P.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.602
Got it.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.859
We had no choice. It was multiple
complaints of sexual misconduct.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.529
How multiple? Who? When?

07:25.612 --> 07:29.074
I don't know. It's confidential.
It leaked to the Times overnight.

07:29.867 --> 07:30.993
How?

07:31.076 --> 07:34.580
I have no clue who leaked it.
I fucking wish I knew.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.082
I'm trying to deal with this quietly.

07:40.502 --> 07:45.424
Shit. Okay. HR has been looking into it
for a few weeks. I didn't want--

07:45.966 --> 07:49.636
I didn't wanna drag you in. I was trying
to protect you, Alex, okay? Before you--

07:50.971 --> 07:52.431
[door closes]

07:52.514 --> 07:54.308
You knew about this,
and you didn't tell me?

07:54.391 --> 07:57.477
What am I? Some fucking PA from Idaho
who doesn't need to know what's going on?

07:57.561 --> 07:59.688
Alex, I was trying
to respect your space...

07:59.771 --> 08:01.106
-My space.
-...like you asked me to,

08:01.190 --> 08:03.358
so that you can go out there every morning
and do what you do,

08:03.442 --> 08:04.568
what America needs you to do.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.446
Oh, fuck you, Chip. Fuck you.
Don't drag America into this.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.615
They've got enough shit to deal with.

08:09.698 --> 08:14.912
This affects me, okay?
My on-air partner, my TV husband...

08:14.995 --> 08:16.455
[sighs]

08:16.538 --> 08:18.749
is a sexual predator now?

08:19.791 --> 08:23.545
What part of you thought that I should not
have been involved in this conversation?

08:24.588 --> 08:26.298
You think chemistry
just comes in a bottle,

08:26.381 --> 08:28.467
and we go out and we buy another one
at Whole Foods?

08:28.550 --> 08:30.135
Charlie Black's office.
Please hold one moment.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.221
Charlie Black's office.
Please hold one moment.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.015
Rena. Where is he? We need to discuss
how we're handling the show today.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.518
He's in there with her.
And he said no interruptions.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.020
Rena, we're live in less than two hours,
for Chrissake.

08:40.102 --> 08:44.024
Charlie Black's office. Please hol--
Oh. Hi. Let me see if I can get him.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.569
-Really? Wow.
-Really.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.029
-Excuse me.
-Wow.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.322
-[Alex] My ass. You know that.
-[Chip] True. But--

08:50.405 --> 08:53.700
-[Alex] What?
-It's the network-- Cory and Fred.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.035
-Fabulous. Put 'em through.
-Yeah.

08:56.662 --> 08:57.913
-[phone rings]
-I got it.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.082
-Hi, it's Alex.
-And Chip.

09:00.165 --> 09:04.795
-Alex? Alex, it's Cory here.
-And Fred.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.841
I am just incredibly sorry about this.
I feel absolutely terrible.

09:08.924 --> 09:12.845
I feel like Mitch died.
The Mitch that I knew.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.847
And I've only been running
the news division for a month,

09:14.930 --> 09:16.890
so I can't imagine
what you must be feeling.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.475
[Fred] My condolences, Alex.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.018
This is so hard for all of us.

09:20.102 --> 09:23.981
Look, we're all a family here,
and we've had a tragedy. So, we're--

09:24.064 --> 09:27.484
[Fred] Any kind of sexual misconduct
will not be tolerated by the network.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.736
-[Cory] Well, absolutely not.
-[Fred] You think you know someone--

09:29.820 --> 09:32.447
Okay, thank you, Fred and Cory.

09:32.531 --> 09:35.033
But I can't really think about that
right now because I've got to focus

09:35.117 --> 09:38.412
on what we're putting on the show
in less than two hours.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.496
-More caffeine.
-Thank you.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.581
Oh, thank you.

09:40.664 --> 09:44.126
That's exactly why you're the pro
that you are.

09:44.209 --> 09:47.045
We just have to take this
one step at a time, right?

09:47.129 --> 09:48.839
Can't let the fact
that there's hundreds of millions

09:48.922 --> 09:51.175
of advertising dollars at stake here--
We're not gonna let that...

09:51.258 --> 09:53.927
-Fuck you.
-...bother us, because change can be good.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.555
And one man's tragedy,
it can be another man's opportunity.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.724
So let's, fuck yeah, embrace it.

09:58.807 --> 10:04.021
And use this to reinvent ourselves,
make things bigger and better. Well--

10:04.104 --> 10:07.149
Thank God we've got you, Alex.
You will carry us through this.

10:07.858 --> 10:11.445
I guess that's why they've been dragging
their feet on closing my renegotiations.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.823
Yeah. Hey, guys.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.658
So listen,

10:16.742 --> 10:23.081
my gut instinct is to bring the news
to America myself honestly.

10:23.165 --> 10:27.127
Addressing the truth is the only way
to protect our integrity.

10:27.586 --> 10:30.214
So, we will talk to them
as members of our family.

10:30.297 --> 10:34.384
We will grieve with them.
We will go through this together.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.220
She's a class act. All the way.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.304
Shut up.

10:37.888 --> 10:41.475
And if we use this right, this is
our chance to get our audience back.

10:41.558 --> 10:44.186
I couldn't agree more, Alex.
I think you've got the right idea there.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.521
[Alex] Pull the family together.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.649
And we'll get a surge in our ratings
for a few days. And--

10:50.275 --> 10:51.735
I was gonna say that.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.613
May sweeps are imminent, let's not forget.

10:56.949 --> 11:02.412
And yes, yes. We can discuss who
we're gonna be putting in Mitch's chair...

11:04.706 --> 11:05.707
today.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.002
But I am addressing America
up top on my own.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.004
-Like we have a choice.
-[pushes button]

11:11.088 --> 11:13.090
[Alex] I don't want anyone
sitting in Mitch's chair.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.134
Not during this. That's mine.

11:24.977 --> 11:26.687
[sighs]

11:34.319 --> 11:35.696
I can't feel anything.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.741
Don't worry. I'll be with you.

11:40.242 --> 11:44.413
You'll get out there, and you'll feel it.
You'll find it, like you always do.

11:46.164 --> 11:49.042

12:40.302 --> 12:41.345
-Bradley.
-What?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.639
I'm telling you something.
It's for your own good.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.723
What?

12:45.807 --> 12:46.808
You're awful.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.479
Blow me, Alan. Just because I push back?

12:50.562 --> 12:53.649
You don't push back.
You incinerate. Everyone says it.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.192
You fight everyone on everything.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.737
Well, there's a lot of sloppy work done
around here, mainly by you.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.822
You know that anchor opening
on the late hour?

13:01.782 --> 13:02.991
They're giving it to Sarah.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.286
Sarah?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.707
The world's only conservative lesbian
who weirdly looks like Mary Hart

13:10.791 --> 13:13.043
and has also been at the channel
three years less than me?

13:14.419 --> 13:16.588
People like her.
It's not a crime, you know?

13:16.672 --> 13:17.673
Gotcha.

13:18.090 --> 13:21.969
Hey, just do yourself a favor.
Try to be more agreeable, for Chrissake!

13:22.052 --> 13:23.679
I am fucking agreeable!

13:24.847 --> 13:28.225
Coal creates jobs! Coal creates jobs!

13:28.308 --> 13:31.144
Coal creates jobs!
Coal creates jobs!

13:31.228 --> 13:33.981
Coal creates jobs! Coal creates jobs!

13:34.064 --> 13:36.483
No more coal! No more coal!

-No more coal! No more coal!

Hey, I gotta take this.
I got something going on at home.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.790
-No more coal! No more coal!
-Mom, hold on.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.417
Hey, honey.
You sound like you don't want to talk.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.962
Hold on, Mom. I'm doing my job
at a protest right now. What's going on?

13:57.045 --> 13:58.922
A protest? Is everything safe?

13:59.006 --> 14:02.551
I'm at a coal mine.
No, I'm safe. Is Hal okay?

14:02.634 --> 14:03.969
He's doing just fine.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.596
Mom, speak up. I can't hear you.

14:05.679 --> 14:09.474
You sound really busy. I just wanna let
you know I brought your brother home.

14:09.558 --> 14:10.559
You did not.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.478
Don't take that tone.
You sound like a bitch, honey.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.523
-I'll talk to you later.
-No more coal! No more coal!

14:16.607 --> 14:19.902
-Joe! Jesus. Fuck.
-No more coal! No more coal!

14:19.985 --> 14:20.986
Joe. Hey.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.821
-Over here.
-Okay. God.

14:23.238 --> 14:26.200
-Yeah. Sorry about that.
-Okay, Bradley, this is Jenna Macantire,

14:26.283 --> 14:27.492
-she's protesting mines.
-Hey.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.537
This is Bob Stephens. His family's been
in the mining business for generations.

14:30.621 --> 14:31.955
All right. I got it.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.584
I'm gonna need a wide shot, okay?
And then we'll go on three and two, one.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.836
[grunting]

14:37.920 --> 14:40.547
-Hey! You okay, Joe?
-[Joe] Yeah.

14:40.631 --> 14:41.715
Hey. What are you doing?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.175
Let go of me, fake news bitch!

14:43.258 --> 14:44.259
-What?
-Get off of me.

14:44.343 --> 14:45.385
What did you fucking call me?

14:45.469 --> 14:46.970
Called you a fake news bitch
is what I called you.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.306
Oh, yeah? I'm fake news?
What's the real news then?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.350
You tell me five facts about coal,
and I'll let you go.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.643
I don't have to tell you shit, lady.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.604
You knocked down my cameraman. Otherwise
I'm gonna have you arrested for assault.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.606
I bet you don't know jack shit about coal.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.316
You're just out here
trying to raise some hell.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.442
Go! Tell me!

15:00.526 --> 15:01.527
Coal is a cheap fuel.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.529
[imitates buzzer] Wrong! What else?

15:03.612 --> 15:05.197
I don't know. It's easy to get for people.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.657
Wrong! What else?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.367
It makes jobs for everybody.
Everyone's happy.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.994
Yeah, so does death, okay?
You think that's a good idea?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.579
-No, I don't--
-If it's so positive,

15:12.663 --> 15:14.665
why do you think all these people
are out here protesting?

15:14.748 --> 15:16.375
I don't know. Because they
think it's dangerous or--

15:16.458 --> 15:17.709
Do you think it's dangerous?

15:17.793 --> 15:23.423
Do you even know what's in coal ash?
Arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, uranium.

15:23.507 --> 15:26.593
That is some toxic shit.
And what about jobs?

15:26.677 --> 15:28.679
How many jobs have been lost
in the last ten years?

15:28.762 --> 15:29.680
-I don't know.
-Huh?

15:29.763 --> 15:34.643
Thousands! Thousands of fucking families
knocked on their asses.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.436
And it's just a big wheel
that goes around.

15:36.520 --> 15:40.065
Liberals add sanctions.
Conservatives remove those sanctions.

15:40.148 --> 15:43.235
And they just keep fighting 'cause
all they wanna do is hear themselves talk.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.654
And they all want to be right.
And they all wanna win.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.241
And that's all they fucking care about.
And there's a human cost!

15:49.324 --> 15:50.868
And it's exhausting!

15:51.201 --> 15:52.828
I'm exhausted!

15:52.911 --> 15:55.455
-Okay. Okay. Okay, Jesus.
-[panting]

15:56.582 --> 15:57.624
Get off me.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.003
[panting]

16:04.423 --> 16:05.924
Don't knock over old men.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.843
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:09.970 --> 16:10.971
Okay.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.265
-Okay, let's take it away.
-I'm ready. I'm ready.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.267
Okay, are y'all ready?

16:16.560 --> 16:19.605
In three, two, one.

16:19.980 --> 16:23.817
Hi. I'm Bradley Jackson at
Lachlan Coal Mine, reporting to you today.

16:23.901 --> 16:27.321
This coal mine is reopening
after closing four years ago

16:27.404 --> 16:31.033
due to declining coal demands
and rising regulatory threats,

16:31.116 --> 16:33.368
costing this area thousands of jobs.

16:37.122 --> 16:38.373
It's time.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.083
[Alex] I'm ready.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.591
[exhales]

17:00.020 --> 17:01.355
[sighs]

17:06.818 --> 17:08.111
I revised the copy myself.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.405
I gave my copy. I know what I'm saying.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.784
[sighs] Yeah.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.126
-Mm.
-Okay. Last looks.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.258
Thanks. [clears throat]

17:35.347 --> 17:37.140
Okay. There. Thanks.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.352
-Okay, clear.
-[assistant] Check the time.

17:40.435 --> 17:41.687
[director] Stand by, A.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.774
Roll A. Eight seconds to you.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.151
Five...

17:48.610 --> 17:50.529
[woman] Four, three.

17:50.946 --> 17:53.657
-[theme song plays]
-[director] Two. Start your move.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.325
Cue her.

17:56.076 --> 18:00.747
Good morning. I'm bringing you
some sad and upsetting news.

18:01.707 --> 18:05.711
Mitch Kessler,
my cohost and partner of 15 years,

18:06.545 --> 18:09.214
was fired today for sexual misconduct.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.675
All right. Stay strong.

18:12.176 --> 18:16.180
First and foremost, I want to offer
our sympathy and support to the women.

18:16.805 --> 18:21.977
We are devastated that this happened
on our watch, and our hearts are with you.

18:22.477 --> 18:26.982
And to you at home,
I understand how you must be feeling

18:27.065 --> 18:32.446
because I and the whole team here at
The Morning Show are feeling the same way.

18:32.863 --> 18:36.783
Shock, disappointment, disbelief.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.702
She's throwing me under the bus.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.663
And while I don't know the details
of the allegations,

18:42.080 --> 18:46.543
I understand that they were serious and
that keeping Mitch on was not an option.

18:46.627 --> 18:48.629
I don't think we need to watch any more
of this. Let's prep you for your--

18:48.712 --> 18:50.756
Do not touch that remote.

18:51.798 --> 18:55.844
[Alex] We know he was part of our family,
of your families.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.473
We will all miss that person.

19:02.226 --> 19:04.561
But there are consequences in life.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.732
As a woman, I can say
there often aren't enough of them.

19:10.359 --> 19:16.740
And while I will miss the Mitch
I thought I knew with all of my heart...

19:20.661 --> 19:23.330
I am proud to work on a network

19:23.413 --> 19:28.252
and live in a country
that upholds consequences.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.170
What a load.

19:30.712 --> 19:35.843
So, please have patience with us as
we find our footing in the next few days.

19:35.926 --> 19:37.052
[Cory] She's on fire today.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.429
We will bring you the news, as always.

19:39.513 --> 19:41.473
Too bad we can't
always throw a crisis at her.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.183
-It turns her lights on.
-We will share any information

19:43.267 --> 19:44.601
we have with you.

19:45.060 --> 19:50.732
You are part of this family.
And we will get through this together.

19:51.733 --> 19:52.943
We'll be right back.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.488
[director] We're back in 30.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.240
It's good. Good.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.324
That was beautiful.

19:59.867 --> 20:02.327
[woman] Roll A. Back in two minutes.

20:02.411 --> 20:04.621
-[man] Drop down to 40%. Hold.
-[sighs]

20:05.998 --> 20:07.457
-[man] Yeah, that's perfect.
-[clears throat]

20:07.541 --> 20:08.917
-Here are some tissues.
-No, I don't need it.

20:09.001 --> 20:10.419
-I'm good.
-Okay.

20:10.502 --> 20:11.587
[clears throat]

20:11.670 --> 20:14.506
[chattering]

20:21.555 --> 20:22.764
[sighs]

20:26.810 --> 20:29.396
-[chattering]
-[phone chimes]

20:35.277 --> 20:37.154
I bet you don't know jack shit about coal.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.948
You're just out here trying to
raise some hell. Go ahead. Tell me.

20:40.032 --> 20:41.116
-[man] I don't know, coal--
-[Bradley] What?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.951
-[man] Coal is a cheap fuel.
-Shit.

20:43.035 --> 20:46.079
Bradley Jackson.
Stop your ass right there.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.999
Why the hell am I hearing
that you hired Sarah Oppenheimer

20:49.082 --> 20:50.667
for the anchor job on America On Point?

20:50.751 --> 20:53.712
Don't even. You know what everybody's
talking about here today?

20:53.795 --> 20:56.006
Two things. Mitch Kessler is fired

20:56.089 --> 20:58.300
and Bradley Jackson lost her shit
at the protest.

20:58.383 --> 21:01.553
Climb off me, Jones. How was I supposed
to know people were filming me?

21:01.637 --> 21:03.263
What? Like it's not the 21st century?

21:03.347 --> 21:05.265
I was talking to him about the truth.

21:05.349 --> 21:07.559
You remember the truth? Journalism?

21:07.643 --> 21:11.146
We're newspeople, Jones.
Listen to yourself.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.524
I gave you a shot.

21:13.607 --> 21:14.650
I know you did.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.276
When nobody else would.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.112
You've been bouncing around for years,
and we both know why.

21:19.196 --> 21:21.365
-I don't wanna talk about that.
-"Two-Fucks Jackson."

21:22.157 --> 21:26.161
I was very young. I got flustered.
And that was ten years ago.

21:26.245 --> 21:28.664
You get too hot too fast, Bradley.

21:28.747 --> 21:33.669
I accidentally said "fuck." Okay?
And then I got mad at myself and--

21:33.752 --> 21:36.547
Said "fuck" again, on live TV.

21:36.630 --> 21:37.714
[sighs]

21:37.798 --> 21:39.007
I remember.

21:39.091 --> 21:42.094
And there goes
the ballad of Bradley Jackson.

21:44.054 --> 21:46.765
You know what? Find some other puppet.

21:47.182 --> 21:50.143
Find some other person that
you can put slanted copy in front of them,

21:50.227 --> 21:53.981
that'll go to the coal mine protests,
your school shootings,

21:54.064 --> 21:56.108
the pregnant lady that got hit by a truck.

21:56.191 --> 22:00.320
Find somebody else to be invisible for
you, to deal with the world's heartaches

22:00.404 --> 22:02.990
and not have
any fucking feelings about it!

22:03.073 --> 22:04.074
I quit!

22:05.534 --> 22:10.330
Research shows that sexual harassment
in the early stages of one's career

22:10.414 --> 22:13.584
can lead to long-term
psychological damage.

22:13.667 --> 22:19.131
And specifically, what type of behavior
or-- or, uh, uh, harassment

22:19.214 --> 22:20.465
would cause that kind of long-term damage?

22:20.549 --> 22:22.134
[director] Stand by camera three.

22:22.217 --> 22:24.678
Jesus, Yanko. Could he be
more uncomfortable talking about this?

22:24.761 --> 22:27.472
[sighs] Don't let Yanko talk.

22:27.556 --> 22:32.436
As you said, Dr. Marino, this affects
so many of us. What would you say...

22:32.519 --> 22:35.772
You knocked down my cameraman. Otherwise
I'm gonna have you arrested for assault.

22:35.856 --> 22:37.608
I bet you don't know jack shit about coal.

22:37.691 --> 22:40.694
You're just out here trying to
raise some hell. Go ahead. Tell me.

22:40.777 --> 22:41.778
-I don't know--
-What?

22:41.862 --> 22:42.863
Coal is a cheap fuel.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.823
[imitates buzzer] Wrong! What else?

22:45.407 --> 22:46.408
Hannah.

22:46.491 --> 22:47.492
Wrong! What else?

22:47.576 --> 22:49.745
You said you were looking for stories
about strong women tomorrow.

22:49.828 --> 22:50.871
Check this out.

22:50.954 --> 22:53.624
[Bradley] If it's so fucking great, why
are these people are out here protesting?

22:53.707 --> 22:56.084
-I don't know. They think it's dangerous.
-Do you even know what's in coal ash?

22:56.168 --> 22:57.794
-Who is this?
-Let me help you out.

22:57.878 --> 23:01.256
Bradley Jackson, some conservative
correspondent for SENN.

23:01.340 --> 23:06.053
She's fucking funny,
but also resonates some truth.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.639
And the weary voice of America speaks out.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.308
It's like a little piece
of performance art.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.019
[Bradley] Thousands.
Thousands of jobs have been lost.

23:16.313 --> 23:19.149
They can't do this to me. It's illegal.

23:19.650 --> 23:21.902
They can't just take my life away
based on hearsay.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.696
They have documented complaints, Mitch.
We have to deal with the reality--

23:24.780 --> 23:28.659
Documented complaints about what? That
I had affairs? Since when is that a crime?

23:28.742 --> 23:32.454
No, no, no, no. No. I'm--
I'm not proud of it, but what the fuck?

23:32.538 --> 23:34.456
I didn't invent extracurricular sex.

23:34.540 --> 23:35.999
What is happening here?

23:36.083 --> 23:41.213
The network that I gave 20 years
of my life plus is now locking me out.

23:41.296 --> 23:42.548
Throwing me to the wolves.

23:42.631 --> 23:44.591
They won't even
engage in a discussion with me?

23:44.675 --> 23:46.677
Listen, take it easy.
Don't get all worked up--

23:46.760 --> 23:48.887
"Don't get all worked up"?
Are you kidding me?

23:48.971 --> 23:52.808
My life just ended for no good reason,
and I should stay calm?

23:53.976 --> 23:57.020
You know what? I didn't rape anybody!

23:59.147 --> 24:03.026
I didn't fire anybody. I didn't jizz
into a plant in front of somebody.

24:03.110 --> 24:06.405
You know what I did?
I fucked a couple of PA's and assistants.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.741
Big fuckin' deal. They liked it.
I mean, who are we kidding?

24:10.325 --> 24:13.745
Everything's changed,
but they forgot to send me the memo.

24:13.829 --> 24:17.124
Since the dawn of time, men have used
their power to attract women.

24:17.207 --> 24:20.627
And now let's bust Mitch Kessler's head
over it.

24:20.711 --> 24:22.212
Mitch, let me make you a drink.

24:22.296 --> 24:25.215
I didn't hold a gun to anybody's head.
It was consensual.

24:26.175 --> 24:27.759
Most of them came on to me.

24:27.843 --> 24:31.597
One of them actually told me
that I taught her how to have good sex!

24:32.055 --> 24:37.936
And now, that stupid, comedy weather fuck
is in my seat. No fucking way!

24:38.020 --> 24:42.441
Come on. Fuck you! Fuck you!

24:43.317 --> 24:44.318
God.

24:44.943 --> 24:47.112
You little motherfucker!

24:47.196 --> 24:48.614
God damn it!

24:49.865 --> 24:54.411
[grunting, screaming]

24:55.245 --> 24:56.246
[grunting]

24:58.123 --> 24:59.625
[grunts]

24:59.708 --> 25:02.211
-[clatters on floor]
-[panting]

25:04.338 --> 25:05.631
Okay.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.969
We're gonna fight this.
[panting]

25:11.053 --> 25:13.597
We're gonna come up with a plan,
and we're gonna fight this. [sighs]

25:13.680 --> 25:17.017
-[footsteps approaching]
-Okay. Okay.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.019
[clears throat]

25:20.145 --> 25:23.815
I'm picking up the kids from school
and taking them to the Hamptons.

25:25.192 --> 25:26.610
I'm divorcing you.

25:28.111 --> 25:31.949
I haven't liked you for a while anyway.

25:32.783 --> 25:34.159
Goodbye.

25:34.243 --> 25:35.869
Come on, Paige.

25:37.454 --> 25:40.123
[sighs] Fuck!

25:42.167 --> 25:43.502
[knocking]

25:44.670 --> 25:46.380
-Who is it?
-[Chip] It's me.

26:02.354 --> 26:05.232
You did great. Yanko was a lot of work.
It was a bad call from Cory.

26:05.315 --> 26:06.316
You think?

26:06.400 --> 26:10.195
We better have our shit together when
the network jerk-offs get here today.

26:11.405 --> 26:14.616
And I don't want that new guy
from the entertainment division

26:14.700 --> 26:17.077
making the call about
who sits in that chair next to me.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.997
Because I have to carry their ass!

26:21.415 --> 26:23.292
The guy's a fucking moron.

26:23.959 --> 26:26.920
They should never have made him
the head of the news division.

26:27.546 --> 26:31.508
[sighs] And I wanna know every idea
of who they're going after for that chair.

26:31.592 --> 26:33.635
We're precarious enough in the ratings.

26:33.719 --> 26:34.720
Okay. I understand.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.889
Well, you better,
'cause this is all your fault.

26:36.972 --> 26:40.100
You are the EP.
The show is slipping on your watch.

26:40.184 --> 26:41.727
And now that shit.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.688
You know I don't control everything, Alex.

26:44.771 --> 26:47.482
Well, you're supposed to. That's your job.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.452
[reporters shouting]

27:03.707 --> 27:06.418
All right, hot soup coming through.
Hot soup coming through.

27:06.502 --> 27:08.086
[all shouting]

27:08.712 --> 27:10.297
I just wanna say this.

27:11.465 --> 27:14.426
As long as I am the president
of the UBA news division,

27:14.510 --> 27:18.347
behavior such as that exhibited
by Mitch Kessler will not be tolerated.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.390
Out of respect
for those who have suffered,

27:20.474 --> 27:22.476
I'll be making no further comment
at this time.

27:23.018 --> 27:26.271
Let's get PR back on the phone. I need
to know how our response is landing.

27:26.355 --> 27:30.275
I need writers and producers,
just all senior staff in my office

27:30.359 --> 27:32.569
with ideas for how the fuck we're gonna
get through these next two days.

27:32.653 --> 27:33.654
The bosses are saying--

27:33.737 --> 27:35.322
Jesus, Joel. Pick a side.

27:35.405 --> 27:36.406
I'm on your side.

27:36.490 --> 27:37.991
Of the fucking hallway. Jesus.

27:38.075 --> 27:41.578
Okay. They're saying they want this week
to land somewhere between repudiation

27:41.662 --> 27:44.373
and navel-gazing, whatever the fuck that
means. I have no idea what they're--

27:44.456 --> 27:45.999
I'll be back A.S.A.P.
Can you survive without me?

27:46.083 --> 27:47.334
Yes. Text me as soon as you know.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.253
-Where was I?
-Repudiation and navel-gazing.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.922
Data and Research. What the fuck?
Why aren't they calling us back? Okay.

27:52.005 --> 27:53.632
We need that huddle. We need it right now.

27:53.715 --> 27:57.135
And lastly, just get the entire
talent team up here, okay?

27:57.219 --> 28:00.264
We need to start preparing our long-term
strategy. You're getting all this, right?

28:00.347 --> 28:02.432
Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

28:02.516 --> 28:05.102
Oh, you know what?
That is not funny. Fuck you and f--

28:06.061 --> 28:08.772
Cory. Uh, hey.

28:08.856 --> 28:10.607
Is, uh, now a good time?

28:10.691 --> 28:14.069
I wasn't expecting you till-- Yes. Yeah.

28:14.152 --> 28:16.530
Well, you know.
When the Exxon Valdez hits the reef

28:16.613 --> 28:19.157
and spills ten million gallons
of your oil into the water,

28:19.241 --> 28:21.618
you kinda drop whatever you're doing
and fly to Alaska.

28:21.702 --> 28:22.953
Of course you do. Yeah.

28:23.036 --> 28:25.247
And if I might exhaust the metaphor,

28:25.330 --> 28:28.083
you don't leave until you make sure

28:28.166 --> 28:32.462
that every last salmon
and sea otter is scraped clean.

28:32.546 --> 28:37.176
So, we're gonna clean
some fuckin' sea otters, Chip, right?

28:37.259 --> 28:40.721
And we're not gonna like it,
and neither are the otters.

28:40.804 --> 28:44.224
But I'm gonna be with you,
side by side, until we get it all done.

28:44.308 --> 28:47.477
No matter how long
or how much soap it takes.

28:49.229 --> 28:52.232
-Well, I'm excited.
-[chuckles] Makes two of us. Let's go.

28:52.316 --> 28:54.234
Miles to go before we sleep.

28:54.318 --> 28:56.945
I've already called marketing,
and they're on their way down right now.

28:59.990 --> 29:03.035
[woman] We know you already discussed this
with the network PR team,

29:03.118 --> 29:05.621
but they're worried about the network.

29:05.704 --> 29:07.164
-[Alex sighs]
-We wanna focus on you.

29:07.247 --> 29:11.418
How will America see Alex Levy
deal with the fall of Mitch Kessler?

29:11.502 --> 29:12.503
Oh, God.

29:12.586 --> 29:16.173
People are gonna wanna know
what you did or did not know.

29:16.798 --> 29:20.385
Okay, we're gonna work on
your follow-up statement in a minute.

29:20.469 --> 29:23.722
Your first one was
a little too sympathetic towards Mitch.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.557
-I'm so--
-I know you were close,

29:25.641 --> 29:27.017
-but you need to be careful.
-Excuse me.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.101
Excuse me.

29:28.185 --> 29:32.856
All I said was that I will miss the person
that I sat side by side with.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.942
That's just the truth.

29:35.025 --> 29:39.071
I expressed sympathy for the women,
abhorrence for the predatory behavior.

29:39.154 --> 29:42.282
I am a journalist.
You don't have to spoon-feed me this shit.

29:42.366 --> 29:46.119
This isn't just about protection.
It's about opportunity. You know that.

29:46.912 --> 29:47.913
Yes, I know that.

29:47.996 --> 29:51.375
We're in the middle of a tough
renegotiation. This can be good for us.

29:51.458 --> 29:54.211
I know, I know. I know that, okay. Okay.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.964
So, we're gonna hand out
the decks we made,

29:57.047 --> 29:59.341
and we will walk through
the five-tier response

29:59.424 --> 30:01.301
we are going to accomplish
over the next few days.

30:01.385 --> 30:04.263
In particular at the big event
in two nights.

30:04.346 --> 30:06.306
This is the worst timing ever.

30:06.390 --> 30:07.391
Alex.

30:10.519 --> 30:11.520
Please excuse me.

30:12.354 --> 30:14.022
-[chattering]
-[Alex sighs]

30:15.482 --> 30:16.817
Oh.

30:16.900 --> 30:17.901
Hi.

30:19.236 --> 30:20.237
Oh.

30:20.654 --> 30:22.865
I'm so happy to see this face.

30:22.948 --> 30:26.285
Oh, my God. What an awesome surprise.
Hi, honey.

30:27.661 --> 30:30.122
Oh, you didn't have to leave school
to come and see me.

30:30.205 --> 30:35.127
Oh, actually, my class came into town
for the day to see a play.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.504
Oh, that's okay.

30:37.588 --> 30:39.798
But, Mom, I'm so sorry.

30:41.633 --> 30:44.887
I can't believe it. I mean,
maybe I just don't want to, but, like...

30:44.970 --> 30:47.181
-I know.
-I've known him since I was conscious.

30:47.264 --> 30:49.183
I know. It's awful...

30:49.266 --> 30:50.726
-Yeah.
-...and I'm so sorry.

30:53.437 --> 30:57.524
Oh, God. Honey, can't you skip the play
and just stay home with me

30:57.608 --> 31:01.862
and we can cuddle and we can make snacks
and watch The British Cooking Show?

31:01.945 --> 31:05.157
Oh, just...
anything to make me feel happy.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.283
[man] Hey.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.076
-Oh, hi.
-Hey.

31:08.619 --> 31:11.038
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, honey. How are you?

31:15.459 --> 31:18.962
This big news, I'm... I'm really sorry.

31:20.672 --> 31:23.675
I was texting you all day.

31:24.301 --> 31:28.889
I know. I'm sorry.
It's just the worst day of my entire life.

31:29.765 --> 31:34.102
So exhausted,
and I still have these people in there.

31:34.186 --> 31:38.482
Al, Al. Why don't I just... I can stay.
I could--

31:38.565 --> 31:41.735
I mean, I was gonna take Lizzy and her
friends for dinner before the show, but...

31:41.818 --> 31:45.656
No. No, no, no. You guys go.
I mean, I'm here all night,

31:45.739 --> 31:47.574
and then I have to go to bed,

31:48.492 --> 31:52.788
get up at 3:30 again and again.

31:53.330 --> 31:57.084
It's good. Go, live your lives.
Looks good, you know?

31:57.167 --> 32:00.003
Okay. But text me before you go to bed.

32:00.087 --> 32:03.298
-I will.
-And I'll be back on Friday for the event.

32:03.382 --> 32:04.383
Yes. Ugh!

32:04.466 --> 32:06.677
Yeah? It's all right.
We're gonna get through it.

32:06.760 --> 32:07.970
-Yes.
-I love you.

32:08.053 --> 32:09.221
[Alex] I love you so much.

32:10.597 --> 32:12.266
-Good night.
-Good night. Have fun.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.350
Good night.

32:14.351 --> 32:15.352
[sighs]

32:16.895 --> 32:19.064
-Hey.
-Yeah. No, I can't.

32:20.274 --> 32:21.275
Okay.

32:21.775 --> 32:23.318
Go, Jase.

32:24.528 --> 32:25.529
Bye, Al.

32:25.612 --> 32:26.613
Thanks.

32:29.199 --> 32:30.409
[exhales]

32:31.368 --> 32:33.078
[grunts, sniffles]

32:42.421 --> 32:43.463
[sobs]

32:52.848 --> 32:55.559
[country music playing]

33:08.197 --> 33:10.866
[music continues]

33:10.949 --> 33:13.702
Hey, honey. What a nice surprise.
Just in time for dinner.

33:13.785 --> 33:14.995
-[switch clicks]
-[music stops]

33:22.002 --> 33:25.797
Mom, Hal is an addict.
He is bipolar, and he's an addict.

33:25.881 --> 33:28.926
Jesus, Bradley.
Have to be so dramatic about everything?

33:29.009 --> 33:32.346
Just come sit down. We're having dinner.
Hal, turn the music back on.

33:32.429 --> 33:33.472
Hal.

33:34.515 --> 33:35.933
You gotta listen to me this time, Mom.

33:36.016 --> 33:38.977
Are you just upset about that viral video
of you yelling at that boy?

33:39.061 --> 33:41.855
I don't care about the video.
And he wasn't a boy.

33:41.939 --> 33:45.526
Do not derail the conversation.
Hal is an addict, and he needs help.

33:45.609 --> 33:48.237
He's not an addict.
He just went through a rough spot.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.488
Mom, he is an addict.

33:49.571 --> 33:52.199
Hey, look, I'm-- I am an addict, Mom.

33:52.658 --> 33:54.451
-I liked your video.
-Thank you.

33:54.535 --> 33:55.661
But he's better now.

33:56.203 --> 33:57.996
He wasn't even there for two weeks.

33:58.288 --> 34:00.374
You just had him come home
'cause you didn't wanna be alone.

34:00.457 --> 34:02.543
-That is not true.
-It's a little true, Mom.

34:03.293 --> 34:05.921
Do you know the mountains I had to move
to get him into that place?

34:06.004 --> 34:07.589
Not to mention
the amount of money I spent.

34:07.673 --> 34:09.675
-Can we just please have a--
-Hey, Brad, Brad.

34:09.757 --> 34:10.967
I'm gonna pay you back.

34:11.051 --> 34:12.761
-I'll pay you back.
-I don't need you to pay me back.

34:12.844 --> 34:15.639
I need you to be better.
I need you to be safe.

34:15.722 --> 34:18.766
Do you have any idea
how many decisions I have made in my life

34:18.851 --> 34:21.395
-just because I had to take care of you?
-[mom] Bradley, stop it.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.605
How many relationships I've lost?
How many jobs I've lost?

34:23.688 --> 34:26.108
-I'm sorry--
-You are ruining dinner!

34:35.993 --> 34:37.286
[doorbell rings]

34:37.786 --> 34:39.246
Jesus.

34:40.539 --> 34:41.540
I'll get it.

34:42.040 --> 34:45.085
Just... every time.

34:47.337 --> 34:50.966
-Yeah?
-Bradley Jackson. I've found you.

34:51.675 --> 34:52.801
What?

34:55.262 --> 34:56.263
Can I help you?

34:56.722 --> 35:00.225
Hannah Shoenfeld.
Head booker for The Morning Show.

35:01.518 --> 35:03.896
You know you have over a million views
on your video?

35:05.480 --> 35:06.940
What can I do for you?

35:07.357 --> 35:11.069
We wanna interview you
about why the video is going viral.

35:11.403 --> 35:14.573
It's clearly touched a nerve.
We'd like to book you for tomorrow.

35:14.656 --> 35:17.951
I've got us on a plane 90 minutes
from now. We should get going.

35:18.035 --> 35:20.495
Wait. The Morning Show?

35:20.913 --> 35:25.626
The one with Alex Levy and Mitch Ke--
That show with Alex Levy?

35:25.709 --> 35:26.710
The Morning Show?

35:26.793 --> 35:27.920
Mm-hmm.

35:28.003 --> 35:30.005
Yeah. Alex will interview you.

35:30.797 --> 35:34.801
What?
Just because I lost my shit at a protest?

35:35.511 --> 35:38.138
Your words spoke to America.

35:38.222 --> 35:39.932
Oh, no. I don't--

35:40.015 --> 35:44.228
Bradley, some piece of you that is
really you came through in that video.

35:44.311 --> 35:46.271
People are noticing. They want more.

35:50.192 --> 35:52.653
How the hell did you find me
out here at my mom's house?

35:53.904 --> 35:57.074
We're The Morning Show.
We can do anything.

35:58.450 --> 35:59.618
[man] I do everything right.

35:59.701 --> 36:01.828
Everything they've asked me to do
in the last three years.

36:01.912 --> 36:03.497
They just don't know what to do with me.

36:03.914 --> 36:07.835
And they're making us see this popcorn
shit? Fucking Gilmore Girls, The Musical?

36:07.918 --> 36:10.504
-Is the world so bereft of new ideas--
-Don't act like you didn't know

36:10.587 --> 36:12.297
what The Twist was gonna be.
I was in that meeting too.

36:12.381 --> 36:14.091
-You didn't have a gun to your head.
-Why did I get a Master's in Journalism?

36:14.174 --> 36:16.593
What's the point of having a PhD
in Political Science?

36:16.677 --> 36:18.345
Is this what Gabe
comes home to every night?

36:18.428 --> 36:20.639
Why did they hire me if they're
not gonna give me a shot at the chair?

36:20.722 --> 36:23.183
-Jesus. My feed is wall-to-wall Mitch.
-God forbid there's a serious black anchor

36:23.267 --> 36:27.229
on The Morning Show. Not for the
Norman Rockwell family of morning news.

36:27.312 --> 36:28.939
Tokenism at its finest.

36:29.022 --> 36:30.315
You are closer now to the job

36:30.399 --> 36:32.025
-than you were 24 hours ago.
-They're making me jump through hoops

36:32.109 --> 36:35.529
watching the fucking Gilmore Girls sing
about how tough upper-middle class life

36:35.612 --> 36:38.532
in Connecticut is while a bunch
of idiot white dudes eat expensive food

36:38.615 --> 36:40.576
on the network's dime
to discuss how to overlook me.

36:40.659 --> 36:41.660
Yeah.

36:44.288 --> 36:46.498
And what the hell kinda name
is Lorelai anyway?

36:52.045 --> 36:54.590
So this is sort of
getting you up to speed.

36:54.673 --> 36:57.176
Now, obviously, the hunt for a replacement

36:57.259 --> 37:00.721
for Alex is on the back burner,
given the circumstances.

37:00.804 --> 37:02.472
Other fish to imminently fry.

37:02.556 --> 37:05.851
Exactly. But I wanted you to have
the lay of the land here

37:05.934 --> 37:07.895
-just so you know where we're at.
-Thank you.

37:08.520 --> 37:12.024
Who knows, maybe this whole thing
will revitalize Alex.

37:12.107 --> 37:16.820
-I mean, today... pretty fucking great.
-Yeah.

37:16.904 --> 37:20.574
When she does that, you know, she,
like, reaches her arm down that camera

37:20.657 --> 37:24.411
and, like, connects with America,
and that's when she's brilliant.

37:24.494 --> 37:29.875
Agreed. It's just that she's been
"brilliant-light" the last five years.

37:29.958 --> 37:33.086
And it's shown in the ratings.
And I don't know, man.

37:33.170 --> 37:35.297
Maybe she's bored
or complacent with success.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.800
Who cares, really. And now, two of them.

37:38.884 --> 37:41.970
We get to find the new marriage
for America to fall in love with.

37:42.054 --> 37:44.765
-It's kind of exciting.
-Glad you're excited.

37:44.848 --> 37:46.433
We have to get well ahead of YDA.

37:46.517 --> 37:48.393
We can't stand a blow
to the news division.

37:48.477 --> 37:52.314
Broadcast networks can't stand a blow
to anything right now. [chuckles]

37:52.397 --> 37:54.024
-Yeah.
-It's kinda funny

37:54.107 --> 37:56.860
how the entire world of broadcast

37:56.944 --> 38:01.365
could just fall off a cliff
in a few years.

38:01.448 --> 38:04.660
Like, boom. Bang. Lights out.

38:05.702 --> 38:07.079
Unless we reinvent it.

38:08.205 --> 38:11.875
We're all gonna get bought out by tech
unless something changes.

38:11.959 --> 38:12.960
I don't know.

38:13.043 --> 38:14.962
Tech or not,

38:15.045 --> 38:19.883
there will always be a need
for reliable, quality journalism.

38:23.387 --> 38:27.808
People get their horrible news
delivered to the palm of their hand 24/7,

38:27.891 --> 38:31.061
and they get it the way that they like it,
colored the way they want it.

38:31.144 --> 38:33.105
And news is awful,

38:33.188 --> 38:38.277
but humanity is addicted to it,
and the whole world is depressed by it.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.446
That's why what we really need
on television right now,

38:41.530 --> 38:45.868
it's not news or fucking journalism.

38:45.951 --> 38:48.996
It's entertainment.
This is just like during the Depression,

38:49.079 --> 38:51.373
when people wanted to watch
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance

38:51.456 --> 38:54.209
on expensive sets
and live in a dream world.

38:54.293 --> 38:56.378
Dream worlds are essential.

38:56.461 --> 38:59.673
Depressed people, they need escape,
you know?

38:59.756 --> 39:04.052
How long do you think the network
rode the sexual chemistry

39:04.136 --> 39:06.054
between Alex and Mitch?

39:06.138 --> 39:08.348
I mean, sure, people wanted them
to be Mom and Dad,

39:08.432 --> 39:10.267
but people also like to be titillated,

39:10.350 --> 39:15.147
and there is some unspoken sexual fantasy
to cohosts, right?

39:15.230 --> 39:16.565
I get it. I get it.

39:16.648 --> 39:18.609
Alex is like Mitch's widow now.

39:21.153 --> 39:24.281
She can't provide that, and I know
you love her and she is your gal,

39:24.364 --> 39:27.910
but, you know,
nobody wants to watch a widow get fucked.

39:28.410 --> 39:30.662
[laughs] Yeah. Um...

39:33.373 --> 39:35.000
Yeah, it's a cold world.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.920
-Well, it's just the world it is.
-Mm.

39:41.715 --> 39:42.758
[clicks tongue]

39:42.841 --> 39:44.092
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

39:45.511 --> 39:46.512
Good.

39:52.518 --> 39:53.769
Okay.

39:55.354 --> 39:56.438
Thanks.

39:57.523 --> 39:59.024
Oh, my God.

40:09.117 --> 40:11.537
[male anchor]
Kessler and his partner, Alex Levy,

40:11.620 --> 40:14.331
had cohosted the show for 15 years.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.375
The two were such a celebrated institution

40:16.458 --> 40:19.211
that journalists nationwide
are left clueless

40:19.294 --> 40:22.047
as to who could replace the dad
of morning TV.

40:43.193 --> 40:45.237
[sighs]

40:46.530 --> 40:50.325
["Young at Heart" playing]

41:16.727 --> 41:18.187
Fuck you, New York.

41:21.023 --> 41:22.024
[sighs]

41:26.361 --> 41:27.487
Come on.

41:30.115 --> 41:32.117
[no audible dialogue]

41:41.335 --> 41:42.544
[clatters on nightstand]

41:51.887 --> 41:53.138
Ohh.

41:53.722 --> 41:55.724
[no audible dialogue]

41:58.852 --> 41:59.853
[sighs]

42:01.563 --> 42:03.232
Can you please bring the car around?

42:03.315 --> 42:04.316
[man] Yes, ma'am.

42:04.733 --> 42:07.194
I'm gonna go in early.

42:21.416 --> 42:23.710
-[song fades out]
-[chattering]

43:05.586 --> 43:06.879
[sobs]

43:14.928 --> 43:16.638
[sniffling]

43:36.867 --> 43:39.119
[exhales]

43:41.997 --> 43:44.541
Oh. [panting]

43:46.919 --> 43:47.920
[sighs]

43:56.595 --> 43:58.430
[sniffles, whimpers]

44:00.265 --> 44:02.518
[sighs, sobs]

44:08.565 --> 44:11.318
[sighs, sobs]

44:13.487 --> 44:16.031
[sobbing]

44:22.496 --> 44:24.331
Oh, God.

44:32.589 --> 44:36.051
[sniffles] Oh. [panting]

45:11.086 --> 45:12.629
[woman]
So, it's great to have you here.

45:12.713 --> 45:15.174
Oh, and, by the way, I'm Mia Jordan,
I'm gonna be your segment producer.

45:15.257 --> 45:16.592
Bradley. Nice to meet you.

45:17.009 --> 45:18.677
Oh, you want a-- You hungry? Did you eat?

45:18.760 --> 45:22.681
No. I'm okay. I look forward to you
whispering in my ear to stop fucking up.

45:22.764 --> 45:25.517
[laughs]

45:25.601 --> 45:27.102
You're a pro. I have no worries.

45:27.769 --> 45:31.315
Uh, by the way, have you been
to The Morning Show studio before?

45:31.398 --> 45:33.734
No, but I've been in the business
about 15 years, so...

45:33.817 --> 45:35.736
-Oh, wow.
-It's kinda familiar.

45:36.570 --> 45:39.740
-Anna, this is Bradley. Bradley, Anna.
-Hi there. Nice to meet you.

45:40.949 --> 45:42.868
You know,
all studios are pretty much the same.

45:42.951 --> 45:48.498
Huge adrenaline, incredible intelligence,
desperate ambition, huge egos.

45:48.582 --> 45:50.542
[Bradley] ...round and around,
'cause all they wanna do is hear...

45:50.626 --> 45:53.921
Guys, please, stop it.
Give me a second, please, guys.

45:54.004 --> 45:55.255
I just wanna watch this.

45:55.881 --> 46:01.011
And there's a human cost!
And it's exhausting! I'm exhausted!

46:01.094 --> 46:06.350
Yeah. Uh, there is no way that
she did not know she was being filmed.

46:06.433 --> 46:07.851
-It's really hard to say.
-Is it?

46:07.935 --> 46:10.187
It doesn't matter. That's not the story.

46:10.270 --> 46:13.273
Two million likes and counting.
That's the story.

46:13.357 --> 46:15.734
Real or not, it struck a nerve.
People wanna believe it's true.

46:15.817 --> 46:21.031
Yeah. Well, people are idiots. Am I right?
That's all we've been proving lately.

46:21.114 --> 46:23.408
Okay, Alex, I know this has all
been very hard for you.

46:23.492 --> 46:26.828
What is that supposed to mean?
What? Do I look tired?

46:27.287 --> 46:30.374
No. No. You look great.
I'm just saying you don't have to--

46:30.457 --> 46:32.459
-Do I look tired?
-No. Promise.

46:32.543 --> 46:34.795
No, you don't look tired.
Just get through today.

46:34.878 --> 46:38.674
Just do a pleasant little interview
that will make America happy, okay?

46:38.757 --> 46:41.009
I'm worried about you.
Just get through these next few days.

46:41.093 --> 46:42.261
[pats leg]

46:48.767 --> 46:50.477
Can I have my celery juice, please?

46:51.228 --> 46:52.437
Of course.

46:58.235 --> 46:59.653
-[door opens]
-[sighs]

46:59.736 --> 47:01.321
[door closes]

47:01.405 --> 47:03.907
Oh! God, it pisses me off.

47:05.158 --> 47:07.119
Oh, fuck.

47:07.995 --> 47:09.037
[screams]

47:10.581 --> 47:11.665
Okay.

47:12.374 --> 47:13.417
Oh.

47:13.500 --> 47:16.378
I didn't buy a word of it.
Not one word of it.

47:20.215 --> 47:21.925
[sighs]

47:24.428 --> 47:25.804
[exhales]

47:30.017 --> 47:31.018
Okay.

47:37.733 --> 47:38.859
Oh.

47:39.776 --> 47:41.862
[chattering]

47:43.864 --> 47:45.908
-Ready?
-Yeah. I'm ready.

47:46.366 --> 47:47.910
Okay. Great.

47:52.581 --> 47:54.416
We're gonna have you sit right here.

47:55.125 --> 47:56.543
Okay. Thanks.

47:56.627 --> 47:58.086
[woman] Back in 30, everybody.

47:58.170 --> 47:59.213
Okay.

48:00.839 --> 48:03.634
-Hey.
-Hi.

48:05.385 --> 48:07.095
-I'm so sorry.
-[woman] Back in 20.

48:07.179 --> 48:08.222
What about?

48:08.722 --> 48:12.142
Just yesterday.
That must have been so difficult for you.

48:12.976 --> 48:15.270
-'Cause you worked together for so long.
-I'm fine.

48:16.980 --> 48:18.190
[woman] Okay.

48:19.399 --> 48:22.861
-In five, four, three...
-Over here?

48:22.945 --> 48:25.113
[director] Start your move. Cue her.

48:26.573 --> 48:28.659
An unusual thing happened yesterday

48:28.742 --> 48:31.912
at a coal mine protest
in Hanover, West Virginia,

48:31.995 --> 48:37.000
when a local reporter's camera operator
was knocked over by an unruly protester.

48:37.417 --> 48:38.710
Let's watch.

48:38.794 --> 48:42.756
Thousands of families knocked on their
asses. It's a big wheel that goes around.

48:43.173 --> 48:46.343
Liberals add sanctions.
Conservatives remove those sanctions.

48:46.426 --> 48:50.055
And they just keep fighting. And they just
keep going around and around and around.

48:50.138 --> 48:52.099
'Cause all they wanna do
is hear themselves talk.

48:52.182 --> 48:54.268
And they all want to be right.
And they all wanna win.

48:54.351 --> 48:57.896
And that's all they **** care about.
And there's a human cost!

48:57.980 --> 49:01.233
And it's exhausting! I'm exhausted!

49:01.316 --> 49:02.985
[man] Jesus. Okay, okay, okay.

49:03.068 --> 49:04.069
[chuckles]

49:05.863 --> 49:09.283
I am here with Bradley Jackson
from SENN in Virginia.

49:09.366 --> 49:11.076
Hello, Bradley Jackson. Welcome.

49:11.159 --> 49:13.620
Hi. Thank you so much for having me.

49:13.704 --> 49:15.706
You seem a lot more relaxed today.

49:15.789 --> 49:19.710
Yeah, well, this is a whole lot nicer than
a coal mine protest. I'm not gonna lie.

49:19.793 --> 49:24.506
Well, so, what did happen that day?
Why exactly were you so exhausted?

49:25.132 --> 49:29.553
Well, you know, life in general
is just sort of exhausting.

49:29.636 --> 49:30.637
Mm.

49:31.180 --> 49:32.598
Um...

49:32.681 --> 49:38.562
but, as you know, we reporters,
we see the way the world works,

49:38.645 --> 49:42.399
and sometimes you just want
to get in there and educate people

49:42.900 --> 49:46.111
and stop them from constantly
going in circles with their ideas.

49:46.195 --> 49:49.072
I mean, it's just so frustrating.
It's sad.

49:49.865 --> 49:52.075
So true. So true.

49:52.159 --> 49:58.498
As reporters, we are trained to never let
our personal emotions enter the story.

49:58.582 --> 50:01.376
What happened yesterday
that made you cross that line?

50:02.461 --> 50:04.838
Well, I wasn't even aware
that I was being filmed.

50:04.922 --> 50:08.300
I was setting up for my story, and
my cameraman was knocked down by someone,

50:08.383 --> 50:10.761
and something about seeing him
struggling on the ground

50:10.844 --> 50:14.765
made me want to address
the person responsible, so I did.

50:15.265 --> 50:16.850
Mm.

50:16.934 --> 50:20.229
You know a peculiar amount about coal.

50:20.771 --> 50:22.022
Alex, be nice.

50:22.314 --> 50:25.901
Well, yes, I do. I do.

50:25.984 --> 50:28.570
I've actually covered
a lot of coal mine protests,

50:28.654 --> 50:31.573
and I think it's important to know
as much about the subject as possible,

50:31.657 --> 50:34.201
especially when people are literally
fighting each other over it.

50:34.284 --> 50:37.955
Yes, well, America has clearly
connected to that message.

50:38.497 --> 50:39.873
Why do you think that is?

50:40.499 --> 50:43.418
You know, I think America is tired
of Twitter fighting.

50:43.502 --> 50:46.839
It's ignorant, and it's contributing
to the dumbing down of our country.

50:47.256 --> 50:51.552
Parties have created a good side
and a bad side for their own purposes.

50:51.969 --> 50:56.473
And once you villainize someone, there is
nothing left but go to war with them.

50:57.474 --> 51:01.478
I know that you work
at a conservative news outlet.

51:02.145 --> 51:05.232
What side of that argument
do you personally fall on?

51:06.483 --> 51:08.652
Um, the human side.

51:10.195 --> 51:11.655
What does that mean?

51:12.489 --> 51:14.324
It means I see both sides.

51:15.075 --> 51:18.120
But in leadership,
decisions have to be made.

51:18.203 --> 51:21.665
You can't just have empathy for everybody
and do nothing.

51:21.957 --> 51:22.958
[director] Take it two.

51:25.586 --> 51:27.921
Well, say you're president.
What do you do?

51:29.173 --> 51:31.425
-Well...
-Open or close the coal mine?

51:31.508 --> 51:33.927
I'm just here to deliver the news
to America.

51:34.011 --> 51:36.346
That's all I ever wanted to do.

51:36.889 --> 51:38.765
So you're a die-hard reporter.

51:39.641 --> 51:43.687
I like to think that I am, yes.
The truth matters to me.

51:44.271 --> 51:48.567
What would you say to the idea
that it's a reporter's sacred creed

51:48.650 --> 51:51.445
to never let the story become about them?

51:51.862 --> 51:54.448
Jesus. Alex. What are you doing? Stop it.

51:55.282 --> 51:57.367
I would say I agree with that.

51:58.911 --> 52:00.954
And yet this has become about you.

52:02.748 --> 52:03.916
Ah, shit.

52:04.875 --> 52:07.544
As I said before,
I didn't know I was being filmed.

52:07.628 --> 52:09.963
This wasn't part of my live coverage.

52:10.047 --> 52:12.132
Well, there could be some cynical people

52:12.216 --> 52:15.302
who might think
that that was completely set up.

52:16.261 --> 52:17.471
To what end?

52:18.597 --> 52:19.890
You're here.

52:30.609 --> 52:35.280
Well, there are some non-cynical people,
which I believe is most people,

52:35.948 --> 52:37.824
that believe the news is changing.

52:38.450 --> 52:41.662
And the news is changing because
the people who deliver the news,

52:41.745 --> 52:46.667
who showed themselves
as honest and decent and trustworthy,

52:47.167 --> 52:51.505
have in quite a few cases now
proved themselves to be untruthful.

52:52.422 --> 52:56.385
And as a result, I think people are
wanting more transparency in journalism.

52:56.802 --> 52:59.680
I think they want to know the person
behind the facade.

53:00.138 --> 53:05.227
I think they want to trust that the person
telling them the truth about the world

53:05.727 --> 53:07.312
is an honest person.

53:12.985 --> 53:14.111
Like you.

53:16.071 --> 53:21.827
Yes. Well,
the truth is what we are all striving for.

53:21.910 --> 53:23.996
Yeah. It is.

53:24.830 --> 53:27.124
Thank you, Bradley Jackson,
for being with us today.

53:27.207 --> 53:29.334
-Thank you so much.
-Of course.

53:29.418 --> 53:33.213
We will be right back
with a surprise secret about vitamin D.

53:33.297 --> 53:35.424
-[woman] And we're out.
-[director] Stand by to break.

53:35.841 --> 53:37.968
[woman] We're clear. Back in two minutes.

53:38.051 --> 53:40.137
-[sighs]
-[Bradley chuckles]

53:41.763 --> 53:43.974
-You're good.
-Thank you.

53:44.057 --> 53:46.059
Good luck in Ham-Hock, Virginia.

53:48.145 --> 53:49.688
Oh, there. Thank you. Okay.

53:50.105 --> 53:51.231
-It was great.
-Yeah?

53:51.315 --> 53:52.316
-Yeah.
-Okay.

53:52.399 --> 53:54.860
-You were awesome.
-Thanks. All right. Thank you.

53:54.943 --> 53:56.069
[man] Nice work.

53:56.153 --> 53:57.196
Bye.

53:59.448 --> 54:02.159
Yeah? All right.

54:13.879 --> 54:16.757
[thunder rumbling]

54:41.031 --> 54:42.407
Fucking vultures.

54:46.495 --> 54:48.288
[sighs]

54:48.789 --> 54:50.582
[dog barking]

54:52.292 --> 54:53.293
[barks]

55:03.220 --> 55:05.180
[barking]

55:14.731 --> 55:15.816
[barking]

55:36.128 --> 55:38.255
-[thudding]
-Holy shit.

55:38.338 --> 55:40.048
[clanging]

55:40.132 --> 55:42.718
Whosever in here,
get out before I blow your head off.

55:42.801 --> 55:44.970
[Alex] Oh, fuck off, Mitch. It's me.

55:45.053 --> 55:47.055
-Oh.
-[dog whimpering]

55:47.139 --> 55:50.017
-[Alex] Shit. [sighs]
-[dog whimpers]

55:50.100 --> 55:51.143
Alex?

55:51.476 --> 55:53.770
I can't be seen by anybody,
so I had my car drop me in the woods

55:53.854 --> 55:55.063
behind your house.

55:56.356 --> 55:58.233
-You came to see me.
-No.

55:58.942 --> 56:02.321
I came to tell you
that I am so mad at you,

56:03.280 --> 56:05.574
and I will never, ever get over it.

56:06.366 --> 56:07.492
You left me.

56:07.576 --> 56:10.120
Alone on the fucking Morning Show.
You left me alone.

56:10.204 --> 56:11.371
[Mitch sighs]

56:12.164 --> 56:13.498
Because you
had to fuck around on Paige

56:13.582 --> 56:16.627
because you didn't want to tarnish
your little image and just get a divorce.

56:16.710 --> 56:19.171
Hello, pot.
I'd like to introduce you to kettle.

56:19.254 --> 56:22.758
-How can you be mad at me about that?
-Are you kidding me? You're so stupid.

56:22.841 --> 56:25.677
-You think I'm mad at you because--
-Oh, Jesus, beat me up. Beat me up.

56:25.761 --> 56:28.597
You really think that
that's what I'm mad about? You idiot.

56:29.097 --> 56:34.061
I'm mad at you because you're selfish.
You're a self-indulgent asshole.

56:34.978 --> 56:37.523
And your philandering has fucked me.

56:37.606 --> 56:43.070
And I'm gonna lose everything, Mitch.
There's no guarantees. Zero.

56:44.738 --> 56:48.408
Our star was built on chemistry,
and you just blew it up.

56:48.992 --> 56:51.119
And why? Why did you do that?

56:51.203 --> 56:53.205
There had to have been a million
and one women out there

56:53.288 --> 56:54.873
who would've gladly sucked your dick

56:54.957 --> 56:56.542
who didn't work on The Morning Show.

56:56.625 --> 56:58.043
-It's not my fault.
-Oh, please.

56:58.126 --> 57:02.005
-They were consensual affairs, Alex.
-Mitch, you're such a fucking moron.

57:02.089 --> 57:04.007
I think that you're jealous
because of our history.

57:04.091 --> 57:07.886
-Your fucking ego. Oh, my God, Mitch.
-'Cause we had a thing.

57:07.970 --> 57:09.096
That fucking ego of yours.

57:09.179 --> 57:12.349
You really think that because
of the two times you got on top of me

57:12.432 --> 57:15.727
meant that much to me
that that's what I'm pissed about?

57:16.228 --> 57:20.732
You're so stupid. God. Oh.

57:26.572 --> 57:27.781
[sighs]

57:27.865 --> 57:30.242
[thunder rumbling]

57:32.369 --> 57:33.412
[sighs]

57:36.748 --> 57:38.917
You stole my life with this.

57:40.377 --> 57:44.006
You left me in the woods
with a... pack of wolves.

57:45.007 --> 57:50.804
I live a really strange existence, Mitch,
and it's isolated as shit.

57:52.139 --> 57:57.352
I gave up everything for this show.
Any chance of having a normal life.

57:59.354 --> 58:01.982
And you just put me
in a position of losing it.

58:04.693 --> 58:10.073
Everything. Of having nothing.
Of having no one.

58:15.537 --> 58:19.875
You're my partner.
Fifteen years my partner.

58:21.293 --> 58:25.672
And my only real companion,
who knew my life in such vivid detail.

58:27.216 --> 58:28.926
Because you're... It's your life too.

58:30.260 --> 58:31.553
I'm so sorry.

58:33.514 --> 58:35.474
We lived a life
that we're never gonna get back.

58:35.557 --> 58:37.184
And you're not my husband,

58:37.267 --> 58:40.229
and you're not my lover,
and you're not my family,

58:40.312 --> 58:41.897
and now you can't be my friend.

58:41.980 --> 58:43.023
Why can't I be?

58:43.106 --> 58:45.359
Because what you did was wrong!

58:45.442 --> 58:50.280
Alex, you knew these people.
You know that I didn't coerce anybody.

58:50.781 --> 58:52.115
This is Weinstein's fault.

58:52.199 --> 58:53.659
Please don't say that. It's so ignorant.

58:53.742 --> 58:56.995
Jesus, Alex.
I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't.

59:02.167 --> 59:03.710
What happened to your TV?

59:05.087 --> 59:06.547
We had a disagreement.

59:26.316 --> 59:28.277
I'm sorry you're such an asshole.

59:30.904 --> 59:31.947
Me too.

59:34.032 --> 59:36.577
I wouldn't use those two words together
if I were you.

59:37.536 --> 59:39.538
[chuckles]

59:44.501 --> 59:46.253
I have to go. I have to leave.

59:46.336 --> 59:48.255
No, don't. I don't want you to go.

59:49.131 --> 59:50.132
I have to go.

59:50.215 --> 59:53.302
-No, don't go. I want you to stay, please.
-I have to go. No.

59:53.385 --> 59:54.511
I don't wanna be alone.

59:54.595 --> 59:58.640
Just stay for a little while. Alex,
please, come on. This could blow over.

59:58.724 --> 01:00:01.602
-Oh, this is so never gonna blow over.
-Alex.

01:00:02.853 --> 01:00:04.855
Alex, they were going to replace you!

01:00:06.773 --> 01:00:08.692
-What?
-[sighs]

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:13.697
[sighs] They came to me. They said YDA
was nipping at our heels in the ratings.

01:00:15.032 --> 01:00:16.658
And they wanted to make a change.

01:00:18.243 --> 01:00:19.578
I don't believe you.

01:00:21.121 --> 01:00:22.748
You're just trying to fuck with my head

01:00:23.749 --> 01:00:25.751
because you're destroyed
and you want me destroyed.

01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:28.378
-No, no. I wanna save you.
-Oh.

01:00:28.462 --> 01:00:30.214
-Alex, don't go.
-I don't believe you!

01:00:30.297 --> 01:00:33.091
Just stay! I've got a gun!

01:00:33.175 --> 01:00:35.177
Great! Have fun with that!

01:00:47.147 --> 01:00:48.774
[phone vibrating]

01:00:51.443 --> 01:00:52.861
Bradley Jackson here.

01:00:52.945 --> 01:00:56.448
This is Cory Ellison.
I'm the president of the UBA network.

01:00:56.865 --> 01:00:59.409
I saw you on The Morning Show.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:01.954
How would you like
to come meet me for a drink

01:01:02.037 --> 01:01:05.457
at the Archer Gray right now
and talk about your future?

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:08.418
"My future"?

01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:11.380
[chuckles] What is this, my big break?

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:15.133
Well, I suppose that's up to you.
