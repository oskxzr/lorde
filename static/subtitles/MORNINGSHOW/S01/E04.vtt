11:38.377 --> 11:40.377
We'll have to figure out
how to manage the fallout.

11:40.421 --> 11:43.048
No. You have to figure out how
to manage the fucking fallout!

11:43.132 --> 11:46.761
This is on you, Cory!
It's your failed goddamn experiment!

11:46.844 --> 11:47.845
I said she was a mistake.

11:47.928 --> 11:51.474
She was untested and unpredictable
and unvetted, and I was right.

11:51.557 --> 11:53.326
She barely made it ten minutes
without announcing

11:53.350 --> 11:56.729
her teenage fucking abortion
to Middle America.

[FEMALE REPORTER] Bradley Jackson's
revelation has gone viral

12:00.608 --> 12:02.735
and sparked a national firestorm.

12:02.818 --> 12:05.863
The Pro-Life Action League issued
a condemnation of UBA

12:05.946 --> 12:08.657
and The Morning Show,
while Planned Parenthood tweeted that...

12:08.741 --> 12:11.327
- Okay, can you just turn that off, please?
- [DRIVER] Sure.

12:11.952 --> 12:13.162

12:13.829 --> 12:17.625
Oh, God. Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck me.

Fuck me. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Shit, shit.

12:24.090 --> 12:25.091
Okay, okay.

12:27.718 --> 12:29.470
Well, I'm sorry. It's the truth.

12:29.553 --> 12:32.139
[SANDY] I can't believe that happened
when you were 15.

12:32.223 --> 12:34.183
Did you just make that up
to be controversial?

12:34.266 --> 12:36.727
No, I didn't make it up!
Jesus, why would I do that?

12:36.811 --> 12:38.062
You should have told me.

12:38.145 --> 12:41.107
I could have had a grandchild.
I could have raised it.

12:41.190 --> 12:44.318
Oh, 'cause you did such a great job
with me and Hal?

12:44.401 --> 12:47.279
You think I'd bring that kind of problem
into our crazy environment?

12:47.363 --> 12:49.615
Our house?
You think I would possibly do that?

Why are you even talking to me right now?

14:56.742 --> 15:00.830
I am talking to you, Bradley,
because I have to make this work.

15:01.831 --> 15:05.126
I chose you,
and everything is on the line for me.

don't know that you chose me.

Bradley, I know that you wanted
to address America yourself.

16:13.486 --> 16:15.696
-Yes. Thank you, Alex.
- Of course.

16:16.113 --> 16:18.824
I understand that many of you
were insulted yesterday

16:18.908 --> 16:21.452
when I referenced
an abortion I had as a teen.

16:21.952 --> 16:24.872
While I am not sorry
for the life choices I've made,

16:24.955 --> 16:27.458
I'm very sorry
for so casually discussing an issue

16:27.541 --> 16:30.127
that is so personal to many Americans.

that as I embark on my new role here,

16:34.131 --> 16:37.051

to earn your forgiveness,

Well, Fred, that's an extreme reaction.

17:00.407 --> 17:03.911
She's popping. You can't deny that.
Her ratings for Monday...

17:03.994 --> 17:06.872
Of course the ratings were strong.
We promoted the shit out of it.

17:06.956 --> 17:09.417
But after what she did yesterday? No.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.336
I would like to point out that no one
is talking about Mitch right now.

17:12.420 --> 17:13.671
Oh, that's our standard?

17:13.754 --> 17:16.549
Getting fucked by a new scandal
so the old one pulls out?

17:16.966 --> 17:19.385
What Bradley did yesterday
was core shaking.

17:19.468 --> 17:23.180
It undercuts our integrity in
an entirely different way than Mitch did.

17:23.264 --> 17:27.226
UBA has a reputation as a fair
and impartial actor in the news business,

17:27.309 --> 17:30.312
and in one fucking sentence
she politicized us.

on Friday.

- I beg your pardon?
- We have already run the promos.

17:36.819 --> 17:40.865
We did a big end-of-the-week blitz.
That's got a hook. It's compelling.

17:41.532 --> 17:45.161
Bradley will bring authenticity,
transparency, to the interview,

17:45.244 --> 17:47.371
which is what we need right now.

We cannot look like
we just changed our minds.

17:56.255 --> 17:59.592
We can respond to what happened yesterday
by taking the interview away.

like someone's running things.

All right, Fred, here it is. Listen.

Half the country hates her,
but half the country loves her.

for talking about her uterus.

Look, Fred,
we have already course corrected here.

18:36.253 --> 18:38.547
Why don't we
just give this a chance to work?

18:38.631 --> 18:40.299
Because we're still bleeding advertisers.

18:40.382 --> 18:42.903
They'll come back. They always do.
Especially if the ratings are up.

and get on this ride.

It's the investigator that
the network hired from Stern and Young.

It's optics. We can't wait.

19:49.785 --> 19:51.537
We just need to be careful.

19:51.620 --> 19:54.582
More is gonna come out about Mitch.
That is inevitable.

19:55.166 --> 19:58.794
And we need to have each other's backs
so we can survive,

19:58.878 --> 20:00.045

I'm from Stern and Young

20:16.604 --> 20:19.899

the investigation on Mitch Kessler.

20:21.317 --> 20:24.737
I will be having private conversations
with you all, individually.

I don't want you to feel scared or anxious
about any of this, okay?

We're just talking.
It is all confidential. You are safe.

20:34.079 --> 20:37.625
I'm only here to try and understand
the culture at The Morning Show

20:37.708 --> 20:41.587
that allowed Mitch Kessler's
inappropriate behavior to go unchecked.

20:42.338 --> 20:44.465
We want to find out
where the blind spots are.

20:44.548 --> 20:45.841

but I never let myself believe
that it was actually true.

and other organizations
that are funded by our government...

21:43.232 --> 21:47.319
They're completely missing the point.
She's not a conservative or a liberal.

21:47.403 --> 21:50.114
No. No, she's a performance artist.

the American flag every single morning.

Did I do that to you?

and technically my superior at work,

I can't have decided to fuck you
without being taken advantage of?

- Are you answering your own question?
- I'm not.

about power imbalances

Mm, I've only been here about 18 months,

to speak to the culture

where high school girls
are walking out of class today

to show their support for Bradley Jackson,
the new coanchor of The Morning Show,

26:25.222 --> 26:27.433
after the governor
tried to reintroduce legislation

26:27.516 --> 26:29.745
-that would ban abortions after six weeks.
- [STUDENTS CHANTING]

26:29.769 --> 26:33.314
This action comes after a controversial

26:33.397 --> 26:37.234
calling The Morning Show's Bradley Jackson
"a dangerous threat to America."

26:37.318 --> 26:40.529
Mississippi already has some of
the nation's strictest abortion laws.

26:40.613 --> 26:44.200
In southern parts of the state,
walkouts have lasted nearly six hours,

26:44.283 --> 26:46.327

how long it would take a student

I'd also argue that these walkouts
go beyond just the abortion bill.

36:22.153 --> 36:25.781
I just can't help but feel like
it's a little bit safe.

36:25.865 --> 36:27.783
"Safe"? What are you... It's not "safe."

36:27.867 --> 36:30.035
Yeah. Safe. Soft.

36:30.119 --> 36:33.205
Ashley and Mitch
have this flirtatious workplace dynamic.

36:33.664 --> 36:35.374
Mitch pushes it too far.

36:35.458 --> 36:37.460
It never crosses the line,

36:37.543 --> 36:40.337
but Ashley feels all this pressure,
and she quits.

36:40.421 --> 36:42.798
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's not nothing.

36:42.882 --> 36:44.884
No, it's not nothing. It's awful.

36:44.967 --> 36:48.554
And I give her so much credit
for coming back on the show.

36:48.637 --> 36:52.433
I just can't help but feel
like I'm pushing someone else's agenda.

36:52.516 --> 36:56.187
No, no, no. You're helping
to tell Ashley's story. Her truth.

36:56.270 --> 36:57.980
Well, it's a truth.

36:58.063 --> 37:00.983
It's a truth that's been poked
and prodded and vetted

37:01.066 --> 37:05.279
by rooms full of lawyers and executives
and crisis management specialists,

37:05.362 --> 37:08.157
all trying to minimize the damage
to the network.

37:08.240 --> 37:11.702
And, you know,
UBA's exposure here is very low.

37:11.786 --> 37:14.473
Otherwise they would never let this
interview happen. You and I know that.

37:14.497 --> 37:15.498
Okay, okay.

37:15.581 --> 37:18.459
It's like the illusion of transparency
without any of the actual risk.

37:18.542 --> 37:21.295
Okay, fine. You're not wrong.
UBA is a business. Right?

37:21.378 --> 37:23.732
They're not gonna stab themselves
in the face for the greater good.

37:23.756 --> 37:24.757
Right.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.384
But it doesn't mean this interview
isn't important.

37:27.468 --> 37:29.136
Ashley's experience is common.

37:29.220 --> 37:34.100
It's, um, sexual misconduct
at an insidiously routine level.

37:34.183 --> 37:35.226
That shit matters.

37:36.102 --> 37:37.394
It's relatable.

37:37.478 --> 37:39.522

Okay.

with an emotional story to tell

39:39.100 --> 39:41.435

39:41.519 --> 39:43.938
[ASHLEY] I'm so nervous.
I hope my mike doesn't pick it up.

39:44.021 --> 39:46.357
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
We're in this together.

39:46.440 --> 39:47.775
- Okay.

39:50.903 --> 39:56.158

- [ALEX SIGHS]

39:56.575 --> 39:57.743
Cue her.

40:00.830 --> 40:03.416
So, by this point, you were working
in the audio department.

40:03.499 --> 40:07.336
Yeah.
So, I was the person who miked everyone.

40:07.420 --> 40:09.547
It's a quick but intimate job.

40:10.089 --> 40:12.466
So, of course
I was around Mitch every day.

40:12.550 --> 40:17.388
And he liked to tease me when
I would slide the mike down his shirt.

40:18.055 --> 40:19.807
You know, flirty stuff.

40:19.890 --> 40:23.602
And I guess I thought he was fun...

40:24.687 --> 40:27.815
and I liked the attention
from the star of the show.

40:28.482 --> 40:30.651
If I'm honest, I flirted back.

40:31.402 --> 40:35.114
But I never intended for it
to take the turn that it did.

40:35.906 --> 40:37.324
And when did that happen?

40:38.868 --> 40:41.162
I'm... sorry. This is all just...

40:41.245 --> 40:43.622
It's okay. Take your time, Ashley.

40:47.877 --> 40:52.298
It was 2009,
and there was a big production meeting.

40:52.381 --> 40:53.674
Everyone was there.

40:54.508 --> 40:58.637
I wound up sitting next to Mitch,
which... he made sure of.

40:59.138 --> 41:00.806
And he sat down next to me.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.517
So, we were all in this meeting,

41:03.601 --> 41:07.938
and I felt a hand on my thigh,
under the table...

41:09.398 --> 41:10.566
and it was him.

41:11.358 --> 41:12.985
His hand lingered there.

41:14.069 --> 41:17.656
Then I felt him squeeze my thigh
in a way that felt...

41:19.241 --> 41:21.911
Loaded. Sexual.

41:22.453 --> 41:25.164
[BRADLEY] And what was going
through your head when that happened?

41:26.665 --> 41:30.753
If I'm honest with myself,
it was exciting.

41:31.962 --> 41:33.214
Really exciting.

41:34.548 --> 41:39.428
But also shocking and overwhelming.

41:40.221 --> 41:41.263
Confusing.

41:42.223 --> 41:44.100
How did you react in the moment?

41:44.767 --> 41:47.478
I didn't. I should have.

41:48.562 --> 41:52.608
But it all happened so fast,
and it was so public.

41:53.192 --> 41:56.320
I didn't have time to think,
and so I did nothing.

41:57.947 --> 41:59.615
And that opened a door.

41:59.990 --> 42:06.038
And that flirty thing that we had,
it increased.

42:06.664 --> 42:12.294
A lot. And it became... consuming.

42:13.337 --> 42:16.173
"Consuming"? Describe what you mean.

42:17.508 --> 42:19.510
I couldn't focus on my job.

42:20.177 --> 42:26.058
All I could think about was what sexual
innuendo Mitch would throw my way.

42:26.142 --> 42:30.354
And... I knew what he wanted.

42:31.313 --> 42:37.528
There was a question in my head of,
"Should I give it to him?"

42:38.070 --> 42:40.281
Or what would happen if you didn't?

42:40.698 --> 42:43.492
Yeah. That crossed my mind.

42:44.493 --> 42:47.997
But I never did. But I was still scared.

42:48.080 --> 42:54.712
I felt like my entire career
was in the hands of this one person.

42:55.796 --> 43:00.843
I was very confused.
I didn't know how I felt about anything.

43:01.802 --> 43:05.973
And eventually it just became too much.

43:07.141 --> 43:08.726
And so I quit.

43:11.771 --> 43:16.484
Did you ever open up to anyone,
tell them what you were going through?

43:19.320 --> 43:20.571
No, I didn't.

43:22.031 --> 43:23.657
Did you report to HR?

43:25.117 --> 43:26.744
About Mitch? No.

43:29.622 --> 43:30.706
Why didn't you?

43:33.250 --> 43:37.046
I guess I just... felt embarrassed.

43:39.965 --> 43:42.551
I didn't want Mitch to know
that I was complaining.

43:46.055 --> 43:49.975
So you felt
it would somehow get back to Mitch.

43:52.061 --> 43:53.562
No, I...

43:57.858 --> 43:59.819
Wait. That question wasn't vetted.

44:03.531 --> 44:06.325

- It's okay, Ashley.

44:13.541 --> 44:15.418
I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS:

44:15.501 --> 44:20.506
Was there something about the culture
at this network, at this show,

44:20.589 --> 44:23.551
that made it feel impossible to complain?

44:24.760 --> 44:25.928
No.

What the hell is she doing?

44:29.682 --> 44:30.891
No, I...

44:31.559 --> 44:36.105

because I didn't want anyone to know.

Mitch was flirting with you.

44:45.239 --> 44:46.866
You said he did it publicly.

I'm not talking about flirting.
I'm talking about what happened.

45:00.588 --> 45:02.089
Did she hint at this during prep?

45:02.173 --> 45:04.592
- No. She never...
- Tell her to stop.
