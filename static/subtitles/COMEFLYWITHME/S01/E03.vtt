00:02.200 --> 00:05.680
This series looks at life in one
of Britain's busiest airports.

00:05.680 --> 00:09.120
On today's show, would-be
pilot Tommy goes plane spotting.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.640
There's a plane!

00:11.640 --> 00:12.680
There's a plane.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.120
Flylo owner, Omar, gets personal.

00:15.120 --> 00:19.120
Richard Branston is well known homosexual.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.360
If you want to have bum bum time
in the sky, you fly with him!

00:22.360 --> 00:26.960
And we go behind the scenes
to meet the baggage handlers.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.640
It's 7 am and Melody's first passengers
of the day are proving difficult.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.560
Children under two travel free,

01:08.560 --> 01:11.800
but Melody believes this
woman's son may not qualify.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.600
Ross will be two the day
after we get back from Malaga!

01:14.600 --> 01:17.240
- He doesn't look two to me.
- Well, he's big for his age!

01:17.240 --> 01:19.240
He's playing a computer game!

01:19.240 --> 01:23.240
They grow up so fast these days... he's
walking, he's talking, he's even smoking.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.720
Madam, if a child is above 24 months
you need to buy them their own seat.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.520
He's going to sit on my lap.
I ain't sitting on your lap!

01:29.520 --> 01:31.440
- You are sitting on my lap!
- I ain't gay.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.920
Ross, come here. How old are you?

01:33.920 --> 01:35.800
Ross...

01:35.800 --> 01:37.680
One and half.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.280
What year were you born?

01:39.280 --> 01:41.400
- Last year.
- See.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.720
I'm sorry, madam, I
don't believe your son is

01:43.720 --> 01:46.920
under 24 months and as such you
will have to buy him own ticket.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.920
Slag.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.720
- Dealing with the public can be very stressful.
- Stressful, yeah.

01:52.720 --> 01:56.240
But if you work at check-in, you
do get a great discount on flights.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.160
- In fact I went away only last week.
- Did you have a good time?

01:59.160 --> 02:04.200
Yeah, the weather was amazing and I just laid out
by the pool and there was loads of really hot guys.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.440
- Where did you go?
- Abroad.
- Yeah, but where?

02:06.440 --> 02:10.000
Well, I didn't get the name of
the country, but it was very nice.

02:11.440 --> 02:15.720
Flylo owner, Omar Baba, is not
enjoying the morning papers.

02:15.720 --> 02:21.760
Yesterday a passenger lost a leg on board one
of his flights and the story is everywhere.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.360
She claims that because the
seats were too close together,

02:25.360 --> 02:28.600
her leg was trapped and
she developed blood clot

02:28.600 --> 02:32.120
and in the end the stewardess
had no option but to amputate.

02:32.120 --> 02:37.760
I do not feel in any way responsible,
but as gesture of good will

02:37.760 --> 02:42.640
I sent her a very beautiful
Christian Louboutin shoe.

02:42.640 --> 02:47.440
To reassure potential customers,
Omar has decided to film a commercial.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.320
Hello, my name is Omar Baba.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.400
You know me, I am the owner of Flylo.

02:53.400 --> 02:57.040
Some people have criticised my
airline for not having enough

02:57.040 --> 03:00.960
leg room, but I'm here to reassure
you that there is more than enough.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.800
Here are some of my happy passengers.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.720
Hello, my friends, have
you got enough leg room?

03:06.720 --> 03:09.200
- Yes, thank you, Omar.
- You see.

03:09.200 --> 03:13.000
Flylo has so much leg
room, maybe too much.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.200
No?

03:17.280 --> 03:18.920
Did you use dwarves in that?

03:18.920 --> 03:21.520
No, they were not dwarves.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.840
How dare you? How dare
you insult them like that!

03:24.840 --> 03:27.600
Get out, get out, get out
of my plane! Shoo shoo.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.840
Go, go, get out of my plane!

03:29.840 --> 03:33.480
Half an hour, later Omar
calls us back to his office.

03:33.480 --> 03:38.040
I would like to take opportunity
to apologise for my outburst.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.640
I've since found out that
they were, in fact, dwarves.

03:43.600 --> 03:47.360
I've launched full investigation
at how this could happened

03:47.360 --> 03:52.120
and in meantime, I've had
dwarves sent back to Magic Forest.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.480
Is you rolling, is you rolling?

03:54.480 --> 03:58.080
Don't lie, is you rolling? What you
filming this on anyway, is it 3D?

03:58.080 --> 04:01.160
You do know if it not 3D nobody's
going to watch it, isn't it?

04:01.160 --> 04:07.520
Taaj works as one of Flylo's roving ground crew,
but his real ambition is to become a film director.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.800
Ok, so here's my favourite films
of all time in reversalogical order.

04:11.800 --> 04:16.760
Avatar, Transformers 2 Revenge Of
The Fallen, Avatar: Director's Cut,

04:16.760 --> 04:21.160
Transformers, Prince of Persia:
The Sands of Time, Clash of Titans,

04:21.160 --> 04:26.520
Avatar: Ultimate Edition, Avatar: Special
Edition, Winnie the Pooh on a Blustery Day,

04:26.520 --> 04:30.760
X-Men Origins: Wolverine and me
favouritest film of all time is Avatar 2.

04:30.760 --> 04:35.040
I know it's not been made yet, but I just
know it's going to be the best film ever.

04:35.040 --> 04:41.240
A committed film fan, Taaj often comes
in early to browse the latest DVDs.

04:41.240 --> 04:46.040
There's some good movies here, isn't it? Have
you seen this movie, Alien Versus Predator?

04:46.040 --> 04:48.920
This is exactly the kind of
movie I would like to direct.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.880
Because it's actually twice as good as most
movies, because it's got Alien and Predator.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.680
There's another movie like
this... Freddie Versus Jason.

04:56.680 --> 05:00.480
And then I saw another one, but I didn't
think it was as good... Kramer Versus Kramer.

05:00.480 --> 05:05.760
I think it's really wrong that people illegally
download films. It's killing the film industry, man.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.480
I would never do that, I buy all my films.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.080
I don't buy them here...
it's way too expensive.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.680
I buy them from this Chinese man down
the pub, they is only 99p, isn't it?

05:15.680 --> 05:18.200
- Oh, man, Avatar. Have you see Avatar?
- No.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.640
You haven't? You're gay, man,
I'm not being funny, you are gay.

05:21.640 --> 05:25.400
Chief Immigration Officer,
Ian Foot, has to stay

05:25.400 --> 05:30.040
in peak physical condition to
safeguard our nation's borders.

05:30.040 --> 05:34.360
Every day millions of people try
and enter this country illegally.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.360
A lot of them are foreign,
many of them are dirty

05:37.360 --> 05:40.560
and unfortunately all of them are smelly.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.040
My job, in a word, is to keep them out.

05:44.040 --> 05:49.320
This morning, suspicions have arisen over
a passenger who has flown in from Paris.

05:49.320 --> 05:55.080
Do-you-understand-why-you-are-here?

05:55.080 --> 05:57.120
Yes, I speak perfect English.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.120
Good!

06:01.120 --> 06:06.480
The problem is I do not believe you are the
same person as in your passport photograph.

06:06.480 --> 06:10.640
It is me. I just had a
moustache when that was taken.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.200
- That is not the only difference.
- What else is there?

06:16.080 --> 06:20.280
- The shirt is different.
- Yes, I was wearing a
different shirt that day.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.480
- The background is different.
- You don't say.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.760
Also in the photograph
your face is grey in colour,

06:27.760 --> 06:31.440
whereas today it's more of a pinky hue.

06:31.440 --> 06:35.320
The picture is in black and
white. What are you, an idiot?

06:36.280 --> 06:39.040
That sort of language will have
you thrown out of this country.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.440
You make no mistake about that, young lad.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.440
To help settle the issue,

06:43.440 --> 06:45.840
Ian decides to take a different approach.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.400
Right.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.760
Ah.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.440
In the photograph the gentleman
clearly has a moustache,

06:55.440 --> 06:59.920
but you look like you've just had one
drawn on with a pen. Not even very well.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.560
I've decided that the best course
of action is to detain our friend

07:05.560 --> 07:10.200
here until such time that his
moustache grows and take a view then.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.600
If in doubt, keep them out.

07:18.160 --> 07:24.680
Great British Air's only flying couple are
Captain Simon Trent and his wife, Jackie.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.680
You've put on a lot of weight. We've been
through this. I didn't marry a fat man.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.960
But today, for the first
time, they are working apart.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.640
We're actually flying to
different places today.

07:34.640 --> 07:37.720
That's right. I've been put
on a flight to the Isle of Man.

07:37.720 --> 07:42.720
Whereas Simon is jetting off to Las Vegas.
Las Vegas... the city of sin, isn't it, Simon?

07:42.720 --> 07:45.800
- I wouldn't know.
- Oh, you would know, you know all about sin.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.160
- Jackie...
- Lap dancing bars galore.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.440
- Hookers on call 24 hours a day.
- Are there?
- Yes, there are.

07:51.440 --> 07:57.280
- I Googled escort service Las Vegas
and there were 1.3 million results.
- What did you do that for?

07:57.280 --> 08:02.880
Because a marriage is all about trust and unfortunately,
you broke that trust when you had an affair.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.560
How many times! It wasn't an
affair, it was a one-night stand.

08:05.560 --> 08:09.040
You told me you did it again in the
morning and that to me is an affair.

08:09.040 --> 08:13.240
I think every woman out
there would agree with me.

08:13.240 --> 08:18.920
At the boarding gate for the flight to Las Vegas,
Jackie is waiting with a surprise for Simon.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.480
- What's she doing here?
- Hello, Simon.

08:22.480 --> 08:28.120
I booked Mummy a last-minute seat so she could come with
you. I know how much you love spending time with her.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.040
- Yes.
- Come on, Simon!

08:34.040 --> 08:37.240
- Have a great time together.
- We will.

08:38.840 --> 08:43.200
I bought her some mace and a rape alarm,
just in case he tries it on with her.

08:44.320 --> 08:50.000
Every day thousands of items of
luggage pass through the airport.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.320
They are sorted by handlers
like John and his son, Terry.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.120
Nah, this ain't the easiest
job in the world, this.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.720
- All people do is moan
about us, don't they, Dad?
- Yeah.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.360
They say we're always on strike,
or stealing stuff from the luggage.

09:03.360 --> 09:07.640
Yeah, but if we're on strike, we can't be
stealing stuff from the luggage, can we?

09:07.640 --> 09:10.680
And if we're stealing from the
luggage, we must be at work.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.480
So the idea that we're always doing
both at the same time is just not true.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.880
Yeah, people moan that their bags
always end up in the wrong places.

09:18.880 --> 09:22.040
You see the thing is if we're
supposed to get a bag on the flight

09:22.040 --> 09:25.280
to New York and we miss it we
just sling it on a plane to Delhi.

09:25.280 --> 09:30.840
At least that way the passenger's got the peace
of mind of knowing that their bag has left London.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.600
- And the cases are getting heavier.
- It's a nightmare.

09:33.600 --> 09:37.280
Some people can't go abroad without
taking the kitchen sink nowadays.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.520
Well, it ain't a problem for you,
you don't lift no cases no more.

09:40.520 --> 09:45.760
Nah, I put me back out 2003, so
I don't lift no bags no more, nah.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.280
Nah, I'm lucky not to
be in a wheelchair, me.

09:48.280 --> 09:52.080
- You was only lifting an umbrella.
- Yeah, had a wooden handle, though.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.400
Cheeky sod.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.400
♪ Morning has broken... ♪

09:57.400 --> 10:02.640
It's 11:30 and over at the coffee kiosk,
Precious is once again having to close early.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.880
Before my shift started this
morning me went to the nail salon

10:05.880 --> 10:08.600
in Terminal 2 to get
some false nails put on.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.120
It is me stepniece Prudence's
christening on the weekend,

10:12.120 --> 10:17.720
but the women in the nail salon, she made my nails
too long and, look, they're not my colour either.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.560
Look, you see, you see the nail?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.960
So now me cannot grip properly. So
me cannot make no double espresso.

10:24.960 --> 10:31.640
Me cannot make no skinny latte. Me cannot make no
caramel macchiato and me cannot make no frappe cappuccino!

10:31.640 --> 10:38.200
Beware Satan. So it is with great regret that I must
close the store early and go back to the nail salon

10:38.200 --> 10:44.960
and have another manicure and also a pedicure. Praise
be to Jesus for his complimentary peppermint foot scrub!

10:44.960 --> 10:48.160
He died so that we may live. Amen.

10:49.640 --> 10:53.400
Penny is the head stewardess in
Great British Air's First Class.

10:53.400 --> 10:57.280
Our first class service
is the finest in the world.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.320
Upon boarding one is served
champagne and canapes.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.520
Then it's a five-course lunch with wine.

11:04.520 --> 11:08.160
Ten minutes after that we serve
sandwiches and scones then after

11:08.160 --> 11:11.760
that it's dinner, followed by
a cheese board and liqueurs.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.760
Then you're force-fed a whole
box of chocolate truffles.

11:14.760 --> 11:21.480
Then we darken the cabin for a few seconds and then
serve a full English breakfast. Welcome to First Class.

11:21.480 --> 11:26.240
Today she is welcoming passengers
on board a flight to New York.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.480
Our departure today will be
slightly delayed. We had a Welsh

11:29.480 --> 11:35.480
gentleman travelling with us this morning and as a
precaution I had the entire first class cabin de-loused.

11:35.480 --> 11:39.400
- Welcome to First Class.
- Afternoon.
- Economy is that way.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.920
- No, we're travelling First Class.
- Let me see your boarding passes.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.280
Our son bought us the tickets
for our 40th wedding anniversary.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.320
- Have you travelled First Class before?
- No.

11:48.320 --> 11:51.160
I don't think you'd like it in there.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.640
- I think you'd find it too nice.
- Well, we're happy to give it a try.

11:54.640 --> 11:59.560
The thing is, there are people in there who travel
First Class all the time and one of the things

11:59.560 --> 12:02.520
they pay for is not to have
to look at people like you.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.400
But we've got First Class seats.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.480
But if I let you in, you'll hog
the copy of Tattler, you'll try

12:07.480 --> 12:11.040
and steal the Molton Brown handwash from
the lavatorium and you'll spit on the floor.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.040
- We wouldn't do that!
- You look like spitters to me.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.760
We've got the tickets and we're
going in whether you like it or not!

12:21.520 --> 12:26.040
Tommy came to the airport to pursue
his dream of becoming a pilot.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.840
But so far, he's only made
it as far as Happy Burger.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.120
It's going really well.

12:30.120 --> 12:34.800
I'm nae a pilot just yet, but I have
got three stars on my name badge.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.240
Er, this one was for being here a week.

12:37.240 --> 12:41.480
This one was for putting the cheese into cheese
burgers and this one was for mopping up sick.

12:41.480 --> 12:45.440
They're so impressed with me they've
made me be Assistant Supervisor.

12:45.440 --> 12:49.280
So now it's my job to
train up the new staff.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.920
Can I have a burger, please?

12:50.920 --> 12:53.840
- Burger
-. Burger.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.320
- Press burger.
- Press burger.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.320
- Onion rings.
- Onion rings.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.360
Onion rings.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.200
Press onion rings.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.160
Press onion rings.

13:06.160 --> 13:10.360
I do still like to have the Supervisor with
me, just to make sure I'm doing it right.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.600
- Fries.
- Fries.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.720
Fries. What size fries?

13:14.720 --> 13:17.480
- What fries size?
- What fries fries?

13:17.480 --> 13:19.360
- Small.
- Small.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.920
- Small.
- Press small then.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.440
Press small then.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.280
- Strawberry milkshake.
- Strawberry milkshake.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.920
- Chocolate milkshake.
- No, strawberry milkshake.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.840
- No strawberry milkshake.
- No strawberry milkshake.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.440
I have to be careful though.
If I too many get stars

13:35.440 --> 13:38.520
there's a danger I may become
over-qualified to be a pilot.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.960
Can I have the code
for the toilet, please?

13:40.960 --> 13:43.640
Can I have the code
for the toilet, please?

13:43.640 --> 13:47.240
- Can I have the code
for the toilet, please?
- 295.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.800
245.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.480
361.

13:50.480 --> 13:55.120
Penny's flight for New York
is minutes from takeoff.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.760
Look at her!

13:56.760 --> 13:59.920
Disgusting little piggy. Eugh!

13:59.920 --> 14:04.360
Look at him. Guzzling champagne
like some filthy backstreet wino.

14:05.320 --> 14:10.080
- Excuse me, would you
take a photo of us, please?
- That's it. Out!

14:10.080 --> 14:13.320
- What we done wrong?
- Lewd behaviour.

14:13.320 --> 14:18.040
- Excuse me?
- Loutishness, coarseness
and all round general yokelism.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.560
On your feet, chop chop, out.

14:19.560 --> 14:23.680
We're not going anywhere! You've been nothing
but rude to us since the moment we got here.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.120
Air Rage! Air Rage!

14:27.120 --> 14:29.160
Air Rage! Air Rage! Air Rage!

14:29.160 --> 14:33.600
Unfortunately, I had no option but to have
those two passengers ejected from the plane.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.640
Can you stand up for me, please, sir?

14:35.640 --> 14:39.560
My recommendation will be that they
are banned from all future air travel.

14:39.560 --> 14:44.480
So perhaps next time they're on a plane
they'll think about their behaviour.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.960
Well, they won't be on a
plane, but you know what I mean.

14:51.400 --> 14:56.680
- It's one o'clock and Melody and Keeley are
enjoying a well-earned lunch break.
- How's it going?

14:56.680 --> 15:00.560
- Yeah, good. I got the stick, the
patches and the gum.
- Is it working?

15:00.560 --> 15:03.520
- Yeah, I'm down to 40 a day.
- Oh.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.240
- Hi, girls!
- God, you look ready to pop.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.760
I've got a way to go yet.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.400
- Is it twins?
- No, I've had the scan, it's a girl.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.080
At least you won't have to worry
about it being born under weight.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.800
I think it's great you
having a baby at your age.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.520
- Right.
- Yeah, you get more and
more older mums these days.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.960
Yeah, like my mum, she
had me when she was 17.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.480
What a bitch.

15:31.480 --> 15:36.240
Also having lunch are the passengers
of Fearghal's Our Lady Air flight.

15:36.240 --> 15:42.200
We're flying to Rome today, so I put in a special
food order for all the wee Italian folk on board.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.800
For starters we have
melon, with Parma spam.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.280
Then spaghetti hoops. And for dessert...

15:47.280 --> 15:49.080
a Cornetto!

15:49.080 --> 15:53.160
We were meant to have some nice
Italian red wine, but it didn't arrive.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.000
So I'm just giving
everyone a carton of Ribena.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.760
Right. Who's ready for lunch?

15:57.760 --> 16:00.680
Will you be dining with us today?
Will you be dining with us today?

16:00.680 --> 16:03.000
Yes, please, but I ordered a special meal.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.720
That's right, 17D, Mr Ahmed.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.840
Yes, I have it right here. There we are.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.160
Thank you.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.000
Excuse me, I ordered a Halal meal.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.960
- What have I given you?
- You've given me a Kosher meal.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.520
It's all the same, isn't it?

16:17.520 --> 16:21.680
No, no, Halal meal is for Muslims
and the Kosher meal for Jews.

16:21.680 --> 16:26.160
I think you'll find there's only one true god
and that's the Christian God. Enjoy your meal.

16:26.160 --> 16:29.520
Will you be dining with us today?
Will you be dining with us today?

16:29.520 --> 16:34.200
Lunchtime is the perfect
opportunity for Ian Foot to relax.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.640
It's very important the whole
life isn't work, work, work, work.

16:37.640 --> 16:43.760
The rest of the Immigration Officers, they tend to go
off to the canteen together at lunch time. So I like

16:43.760 --> 16:47.560
to relax and unwind by
sitting in my office on my own

16:47.560 --> 16:51.560
and working on an idea I've
had actually for a board game.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.760
It's called Keep Em Out

16:53.760 --> 16:57.480
and it's a fun immigration game
for five to eight-year-olds.

16:57.480 --> 17:04.720
Yes, it's very simple, this white figure here is an
Immigration Officer and you are one of these hordes

17:04.720 --> 17:08.160
of black, brown and yellow figures
and the object of the game is

17:08.160 --> 17:12.240
to gain unlawful access into the
United Kingdom of Great Britain.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.120
So you roll the dice,
four. One, two, three, four.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.720
Pick a card.

17:16.720 --> 17:21.400
"You have smuggled yourself into
the country on the back of a lorry.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.920
Move forward one square." Pick a card.

17:23.920 --> 17:28.520
"You get a job as a mini cab
driver. Move forward five squares."

17:28.520 --> 17:30.560
One, two, three, four, five.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.880
Pick a card.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.080
Ah!

17:33.080 --> 17:36.880
"A terrorist cell is discovered
in your local place of worship.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.480
Move back two squares." That's unlucky.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.800
Pick a card.

17:41.800 --> 17:46.280
"You don't make any effort whatsoever to
learn English, move forward six squares."

17:46.280 --> 17:50.200
One, two, three, four,
five, six. Roll again.

17:51.960 --> 17:58.560
Final square. Congratulations, you have been given a
luxury penthouse at the expense of the British taxpayer.

17:58.560 --> 18:03.360
End of the game. I did send it off to
Waddingtons, but I didn't hear back.

18:04.400 --> 18:08.640
I can only assume they've got
something similar in development.

18:08.640 --> 18:12.320
Officers Roberts and
Stewart work in Customs.

18:12.320 --> 18:15.880
When you go through Customs, you
are required to either pass through

18:15.880 --> 18:18.760
the red channel, which means
you've got goods to declare.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.640
Or the green channel, which
means you've also got goods

18:21.640 --> 18:24.200
to declare, but you're going
to try and get away with it.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.640
A routine search of a passenger
passing through the green channel...

18:29.640 --> 18:33.440
- Someone's been busy.
- ... has revealed a large
aul of illegal substances.

18:33.440 --> 18:37.880
This is quite a find. What we need to do now
before we can officially charge the suspect

18:37.880 --> 18:42.000
is identify and catalogue the substances
found in the gentleman's suitcase.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.760
Yup, I believe this substance
is either cocaine or amphetamine.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.960
I think it's cocaine.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.520
Yeah, that's definitely cocaine.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.280
Cocaine.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.800
Wishwings. Collecting for Wishwings.

19:10.800 --> 19:16.080
Executive Passenger Liaison Moses is spending a
rare afternoon off collecting money for charity.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.880
No? Selfish. Wishwings?

19:18.880 --> 19:23.640
I keep it very quiet, but I
actually do a lot of work for charity

19:23.640 --> 19:27.880
and I have my own charity, called
Wishwings. If you'll pardon the pun.

19:27.880 --> 19:32.480
"We take very ill children and give
them the flight of their lives."

19:32.480 --> 19:36.000
That's a free economy
class ticket one-way.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.280
Last year I took a young girl
to San Francisco. Unfortunately

19:40.280 --> 19:44.360
she was too ill to leave the hotel
room, but I had a wonderful time.

19:44.360 --> 19:48.840
And this year I'm planning to take a group
of sick children to the Sydney Mardi Gras.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.840
Basically, all the parents
get sent one of these

19:51.840 --> 19:54.800
and they can choose any
destination they like.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.200
Oh!

19:57.200 --> 20:01.520
I'm about to meet a very brave
little boy called Charlie.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.240
His parents wrote to me and
said he's not well at all,

20:04.240 --> 20:07.880
so I'm taking him for a magical
weekend in Mykonos. Hello.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.400
- Hello, you must be Moses.
- I didn't know he was in a wheelchair.

20:11.400 --> 20:16.920
I'm afraid Charlie's taken a turn for the
worse so he's had to start using the chair.

20:16.920 --> 20:21.000
- Is that a problem?
- Well, it's just a lot of the
bars I was planning to go to are

20:21.000 --> 20:25.520
- in the backstreets and
there's quite a lot of steps.
- Aren't you taking him to the beach?

20:25.520 --> 20:29.760
To be honest, I'm so shattered from the clubs
the night before I don't make it to the beach.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.640
He was really looking forward to it.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.800
Yes, but the priority for me
has always got to be Charlie.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.600
My concern is only for his health
and well-being. Do you understand me?

20:39.600 --> 20:43.880
- Yes.
- I think the best thing is, I
go to Mykonos and then I call Charlie

20:43.880 --> 20:47.600
while I'm there and tell him what
a wonderful time I'm having. Yeah?

20:47.600 --> 20:50.720
Yeah, would you like that, Charlie? Yeah!

20:50.720 --> 20:53.000
Of course you would, course you would!

20:54.080 --> 20:55.840
Oh, it's not contagious, is it?

20:57.880 --> 21:00.720
Right, well, nice to meet you. Bye-bye.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.560
We'll let you know how he gets on.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.240
Yeah, text me.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.760
Yes, it's a wonderful
feeling helping others.

21:07.760 --> 21:11.880
Just seeing the look on little
Charlie's face when I told him

21:11.880 --> 21:16.120
I was going to phone him from
Mykonos, it was very special.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.720
Sorry. Sorry...

21:18.720 --> 21:22.320
I'm just... I'm just a little
bit upset thinking about Charlie.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.400
I'm fine, I'm fine.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.520
It's just I thinking about Charlie.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.280
I'm fine.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.640
Did you see Charlie's face?

21:39.640 --> 21:42.280
Oh, it's my flight.

21:45.880 --> 21:50.560
Back in customs, Officers Roberts and
Stewart are still cataloguing the drugs.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.240
I dunno what that is.

21:56.880 --> 21:57.920
Heroin.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.960
Is it?

22:02.840 --> 22:04.240
Was they?

22:04.240 --> 22:06.920
Did ya? Nice!

22:07.920 --> 22:11.360
Taaj is reaching the end of his
shift, but has just been phoned

22:11.360 --> 22:13.960
by a colleague who has
some very exciting news.

22:13.960 --> 22:18.280
Ok, so last weekend I wrote a movie
script which I'm going to direct,

22:18.280 --> 22:23.680
produce, star in, do the music and my mother
is very, very kindly going to do the catering.

22:23.680 --> 22:28.400
It's called Future Cop 2000 and it's
all about this cop from the future

22:28.400 --> 22:32.960
called Sanjay who solves crimes and
that. It's really good, isn't it?

22:32.960 --> 22:34.880
Very original, too. Excellent.

22:34.880 --> 22:40.280
So what I need to do is find a big Hollywood movie
star to help me get this project off the ground.

22:40.280 --> 22:44.400
Now I just heard that Rupert Grints from
the Harry Potters is flying in from LA.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.920
So I'm going to see if I
can give the script to him.

22:46.920 --> 22:51.120
I'm so excited, man, this is my chance
to be a big time movie directors!

22:51.120 --> 22:53.640
Rupert. Hey, man, Rupert!

22:53.640 --> 22:55.720
You is that Rupert Grints, isn't it?

22:55.720 --> 22:58.280
- Rupert Grint, yeah.
- That's what I said, Rupert Grints.

22:58.280 --> 23:02.440
- I love you, man, you is like one of my
favouritest actors of all times.
- Thank you.

23:02.440 --> 23:07.240
I love Harry Potter, but I never realised you
looked like that, I thought your face was all CGI.

23:07.240 --> 23:10.040
I haven't seen them all,
though. I've only seen the one

23:10.040 --> 23:13.520
where they're all in a school and
it's all magic, wizards and shit.

23:13.520 --> 23:17.440
- Oh, yeah, and I downloaded
that film Driving School.
- Did you enjoy it?

23:17.440 --> 23:21.040
I'm glad I didn't pay for it. It was
just you and Julie Walters talking.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.800
There were no tits or arse. You
could at least done sex on her.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.800
- It's a really good film.
- No, me and my brother didn't like it.
- Next.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.840
- I've got to get my case,
nice to meet you.
- I've writ a movie script.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.560
Right.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.280
Yeah, it's called Future Cop 2000,
right, and I'm going to star in it,

23:36.280 --> 23:39.920
but I need a really brilliant young
British actor to play the enemy.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.760
- Thanks.
- So can you give that
to Daniel Radcliffe?

23:44.600 --> 23:47.920
Tell him it's the part
of the evil cyber, Wahid!

23:49.560 --> 23:53.080
I'm shaking, man, that
is the actual Ron Weasels!

23:54.080 --> 23:58.680
Flylo recently branched out
into offering package holidays.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.800
But these customers are far from happy.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.840
- I would like a complaint form, please!
- What's the problem?

24:03.840 --> 24:09.600
Well, we booked a holiday through your so-called
company and we have had the holiday from hell!

24:09.600 --> 24:13.320
It was our anniversary, so
we booked to go to Cyprus.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.680
- It all started when
we got off the plane.
- Yes, thank you, Peter.

24:16.680 --> 24:22.960
It all started when we got off the plane and discovered
that the Flylo hotel complex hadn't been built yet.

24:22.960 --> 24:28.120
It was just a mound of earth. Well, that
was our first disappointment, but we thought,

24:28.120 --> 24:32.520
"Ho-hum, let's get on with it," and we
dug a hole in the ground and stayed there.

24:32.520 --> 24:35.760
- We booked for a continental breakfast.
- Yes, thank you, Peter.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.840
We booked for a continental breakfast,
meats and cheeses, a selection

24:39.840 --> 24:43.520
of pastries, a choice of tea or
coffee... but there was no food.

24:43.520 --> 24:47.040
- Not a sausage.
- You're now complicating
matters, Peter, because

24:47.040 --> 24:50.360
- in fairness to Flylo, they never
promised sausages.
- Sorry, Judith.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.800
Apology accepted, Peter. Yes,
there was no food whatsoever, but

24:53.800 --> 25:00.040
we thought, "Ho-hum, no point feeling sorry for
ourselves," and we survived on a diet of insects and grubs.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.600
I'm a vegetarian, so I just ate soil.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.480
Yes, I was coming to that, Peter.

25:04.480 --> 25:08.480
Peter is a vegetarian so he just ate soil.

25:08.480 --> 25:12.960
Now the problem was... I don't know if
the soil hadn't been cooked properly,

25:12.960 --> 25:16.560
- but Peter had a very,
very bad upset stomach.
- Loose stools.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.760
Peter, don't be disgusting...
we don't need to hear about that!

25:19.760 --> 25:22.640
- Sorry, Judith.
- Peter had very loose stools

25:22.640 --> 25:27.800
and for the remainder of the trip was lying on the
ground clutching his guts with a cork up his anus.

25:27.800 --> 25:31.640
Wasn't the worst holiday we've been
on, but it was certainly up there.

25:31.640 --> 25:35.320
It six o'clock and Precious
is still at the airport.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.640
See what the nail shop lady done now?

25:37.640 --> 25:40.960
She take the old nails
off and put new nails on,

25:40.960 --> 25:44.800
but they even longer, and look
what she's done to my foots!

25:44.800 --> 25:47.320
It's the craziness is what it is!

25:47.320 --> 25:49.400
So now me consigned to wheelchair.

25:49.400 --> 25:53.120
So me got no option but to
take the rest of the week off.

25:53.120 --> 25:56.800
The Lord sure do work in mysterious ways.

25:56.800 --> 26:01.160
♪ He got the whole world in his hands

26:01.160 --> 26:04.920
♪ He got the whole wide
world in his hands. ♪

26:04.920 --> 26:10.040
Back at Customs, Officers Roberts and
Stewart continue their investigation.

26:37.280 --> 26:41.840
Yeah, you should just go. Yeah,
cos, like, we're all on a journey.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.040
Er... sorry we stopped you...

26:45.040 --> 26:48.120
just try not to get in
any trouble again, yeah?

26:59.520 --> 27:01.400
Leave us something!

27:03.880 --> 27:10.040
The sun sinks slowly beneath the horizon and
another day at the airport draws to a close.

27:10.040 --> 27:13.600
The Customs Officers felt
a bit down the next day.

27:14.600 --> 27:20.000
The couple ejected from First Class were
taken for questioning in Guantanamo Bay.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.440
And the man detained in
Immigration grew a moustache,

27:23.440 --> 27:26.120
but Ian decided not to
allow him into the country...

27:27.600 --> 27:30.000
as he was French.
