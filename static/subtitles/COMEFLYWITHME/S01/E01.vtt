00:01.880 --> 00:04.839
This is one of busiest airports in Europe.

00:04.840 --> 00:08.679
Over 40 million passengers
pass through every year.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.839
Our cameras have spent six
months following the lives

00:11.840 --> 00:13.759
of the people who work here,

00:13.760 --> 00:15.799
from the staff at the check-in desk...

00:15.800 --> 00:17.559
- Where are you flying to?
- Bangkok.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.079
Bangkok, you dirty
bugger. Right, let's see.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.919
... to the cabin crew at 32,000 feet...

00:22.920 --> 00:24.800
Chicken or turkey? Chicken or turkey?

00:24.801 --> 00:27.159
- What's your vegetarian option?
- Chicken.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.399
... and even the airline owners themselves.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.399
"Toilets take up too much space on plane."

00:32.400 --> 00:36.759
If it is an hour flight,
two hours to Rome, to Paris,

00:36.760 --> 00:38.359
you can hold it in.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.799
So sit back,

00:39.800 --> 00:41.159
fasten your seat belts

00:41.160 --> 00:44.480
and Come Fly With Me.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.919
How old are you girls?
You all over 16, yes?

01:19.920 --> 01:25.239
Omar Baba is the flamboyant
owner of low-cost airline FlyLo.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.839
"God gave me a mission."

01:27.840 --> 01:31.879
He come to me and he say,
"Omar, I have chosen you to bring

01:31.880 --> 01:34.479
low-cost air travel
to flights within Europe

01:34.480 --> 01:37.399
and some selected routes
across the Atlantic."

01:37.400 --> 01:41.759
And I said to him, "I will
not let you down, Mr God."

01:41.760 --> 01:46.639
Omar is one of Britain's
most high-profile businessmen,

01:46.640 --> 01:47.920
but today he has woken up

01:47.921 --> 01:50.319
to find himself in the
middle of a PR disaster.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.639
Why?

01:51.640 --> 01:54.879
I have not had plane crash since Tuesday.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.519
There have been allegations
in the morning papers

01:57.520 --> 02:00.559
that FlyLo planes have been
flying without life jackets,

02:00.560 --> 02:02.239
but Omar is quick to respond.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.399
This seat, life jacket.
This seat, life jacket.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.919
This seat, life jacket.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.679
This seat...

02:10.680 --> 02:12.519
life jacket soon.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.799
This seat, life jacket.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.920
And what's more,

02:15.921 --> 02:20.399
I've made it easier than ever for
passengers to use the life jackets.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.919
I'll show you.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.159
Ok, we are on our holidays.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.799
Suddenly, plane falls into sea. Kaboom!

02:30.800 --> 02:32.999
Plane is now filling with water.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.119
"Aah! Aah! Help me!" Not a problem.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.239
Simply reach under your seat.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.879
Hey!

02:42.880 --> 02:45.239
"Do you want to purchase life jacket?"

02:45.240 --> 02:48.600
Yes. "Swipe card and enter pin." Ok.

02:52.120 --> 02:55.239
"Would you like priority disembarkation?"

02:55.240 --> 02:58.119
Erm... yes.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.159
"Purchase whistle?" Yes.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.279
"Add to cart."

03:01.280 --> 03:03.359
Total, £60.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.239
Life jacket is now mine for 20 minute.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.039
After 20 minute, it deflates automatically

03:09.040 --> 03:12.319
and I simply swim back
into plane and pay for more.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.200
Is good, no?

03:19.480 --> 03:22.199
Is quite tight around neck.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.399
Fearghal works for one of FlyLo's rivals,

03:25.400 --> 03:28.719
the low cost Irish airline Our Lady Air...

03:28.720 --> 03:32.639
- Morning.
- ... and aviation runs in his family.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.880
- Hi. -"There's ten of us,

03:33.881 --> 03:34.919
ten boys.

03:34.920 --> 03:39.839
We're all gay, except Finbar,
who's bi, and we're all cabin crew.

03:39.840 --> 03:43.159
That's right, we're all flyers.
Everyone in my family flies.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.279
Except my mother, she's never flown.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.399
Well, she's never not been pregnant.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.079
Turn the phone off, please.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.239
One of Fearghal's duties is to
prepare the passengers for take-off,

03:53.240 --> 03:54.879
however young they may be.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.199
Oh, hello!

03:56.200 --> 03:58.359
Look at you! What a cutie!

03:58.360 --> 04:02.359
- He's just three months.
- Oh, he's beautiful.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.999
I love babies. Used to be one myself.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.959
Look at you, eh? Your wee chubby cheeks.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.999
Can I hold him for a bit?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.079
- Yeah, if you'd like.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.119
Oh, look at you, eh?

04:14.120 --> 04:16.199
Who's a handsome wee fella?

04:16.200 --> 04:17.800
Look at you, eh?

04:19.320 --> 04:22.200
I just need to put him
in the overhead locker.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.239
Madam, I've told you before,
turn that phone off, please.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.239
The FlyLo Check-in girls are the
glamorous face of the airline...

04:32.240 --> 04:37.000
- Hello, madam.
- ... and 22-year-old Melody
Baines is no exception.

04:38.840 --> 04:43.239
I hope you don't mind me saying, madam, but
I couldn't help noticing you are quite old.

04:43.240 --> 04:47.679
- Well, yes.
- So I wondered if you
wanted to take advantage

04:47.680 --> 04:50.559
- of our speedy boarding scheme?
- What's that?

04:50.560 --> 04:53.799
There are no reserved seats on
this flight so you pay an extra £20

04:53.800 --> 04:57.159
- and you can board the
plane before anyone else.
- Do I need to do that?

04:57.160 --> 04:59.679
I'd hate to see you trampled underfoot.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.599
"Some passengers do
resent the extra charges,

05:02.600 --> 05:07.959
but just last week we did lose an
elderly gentleman in a stampede.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.519
All that was left was a shoe.

05:10.520 --> 05:14.079
"Oh, I don't seem to have any
speedy boarding passes to hand."

05:14.080 --> 05:16.159
One moment, please.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.039
FlyLo Check-in, Keeley speaking.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.719
- "Hi."
- Who's calling, please?

05:21.720 --> 05:24.919
- Melody.
- Hi, Melody. Is this about
the speedy boarding passes?

05:24.920 --> 05:27.559
Yeah, I seem to have run
out. Have you got any spares?

05:27.560 --> 05:30.119
Yeah, I'll just get one
over to you as soon as I can.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.319
- Ok, bye.
- Bye.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.960
Shouldn't be a mo.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.440
Excuse me, madam, can you pass
this over to my colleague, please?

05:47.400 --> 05:48.560
Thanks, love.

05:50.400 --> 05:54.479
- There you are, madam,
one speedy boarding pass.
- Thank you.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.039
- Do you sell many of these?
- Yes!

05:56.040 --> 05:58.839
Today we've sold one to
every passenger on the flight.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.200
Next, please.

06:01.400 --> 06:06.399
As with any airport, security
is the number one priority.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.639
Obviously, safety of passengers
is of paramount importance.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.359
Some passengers do complain
about being patted down.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.439
"They feel it's an invasion of privacy,

06:14.440 --> 06:17.919
but thorough physical checks are
a reality of modern air travel.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.560
I don't like it, but unfortunately
it is absolutely necessary."

06:23.640 --> 06:26.480
Stop. Put your arms up, please.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.039
Ok, next.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.559
- Happy flighting, happy
flighting. Enjoy the flight.
- Thank you.

06:36.560 --> 06:41.479
Moses looks after first and business-class
passengers for Great British Air.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.519
Today, he has some bad news to impart.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.279
Something very regrettable happened.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.919
We have a female lady passengeress
on a connecting flight.

06:51.920 --> 06:55.999
Her King Charles spaniel, Coco,
was travelling in the hold.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.999
We had a heating malfunction
and he froze solid.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.399
I've just seen him, he's
like a giant dog-lolly

07:03.400 --> 07:06.560
and it's my job to tell
her what's happened.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.119
- Mrs Ross?
- Yes.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.159
My name is Moses.

07:12.160 --> 07:16.119
I'm the Executive Passenger
Liaison Officer for the airline.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.719
- Are the flight attendants
looking after you ok?
- Yes, thank you.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.719
Have you been offered a small
glass of fresh orange juice

07:22.720 --> 07:26.760
- and a complimentary browse
of the Daily Mail? Good.
- Yes, thank you.

07:31.120 --> 07:35.079
The flight time to Geneva
is 2 hours and 20 minutes

07:35.080 --> 07:37.200
so it shouldn't be too bad.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.799
The weather is clear and
bright, no chance of showers,

07:44.800 --> 07:46.880
if you'll pardon the pun.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.239
Everything is fine.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.359
How's Coco?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.559
Fine! Fine.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.079
Even better than fine. Great! Wonderful!

07:59.080 --> 08:04.919
Barking away and eating a big
bowl of food for dogs and...

08:04.920 --> 08:08.399
- Couldn't be more alive.
- I've got a lovely photo
of him on my phone.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.559
Ah, he was so cute.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.240
Is so cute! What am I saying?

08:14.480 --> 08:17.639
Well, I hope you have a very
pleasant journey with us today

08:17.640 --> 08:20.559
and we look forward to seeing
you again very soon. Dog.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.879
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.599
Take care, Mrs Ross.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.760
Happy flighting.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.879
I couldn't tell her, I couldn't tell her.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.639
"Ladies and gentleman, please fasten your
seat belts. We have been cleared for take-off."

08:52.240 --> 08:53.799
Come through.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.120
Stop. Arms.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.359
Right.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.160
Right. Stop. Arms.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.159
- Excuse me?
- Yes?
- Can I have a word?

09:06.160 --> 09:08.719
I'm just patting down this gentleman.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.480
Can I see some ID?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.799
I haven't got any ID.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.120
You don't work here, do you?

09:25.600 --> 09:26.959
It's 11.00am

09:26.960 --> 09:32.439
and Great British Air Flight
587 from Nice has just landed.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.999
Airport paparazzi Mickey and Buster

09:35.000 --> 09:39.439
have received a tip-off that a
world-famous singer is on board.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.079
We just heard Geri Halliwell's

09:41.080 --> 09:43.119
going to be landing in a few minutes.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.479
She's flying in from
the old south of France.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.759
Hopefully, she'll have her
daughter, Bluebottle, with her.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.319
Takes a lovely picture, Geri.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.839
You'll always sell a
picture of Geri Halliwell.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.919
Same with all the Spice Girls, innit?

09:54.920 --> 09:58.199
Yeah. Obviously, a picture of
Posh Spice will fetch the most,

09:58.200 --> 09:59.480
then it's Geri,

09:59.481 --> 10:01.679
then it's the black one, then Emma Bunton.

10:01.680 --> 10:05.359
- Probably wouldn't bother
with the lezzie one.
- Wouldn't bother at all.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.679
Thing about the Spice Girls,
they had great music, didn't they?

10:08.680 --> 10:09.920
I miss the Spice Girls.

10:09.921 --> 10:12.079
They were the Atomic Kitten of their day.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.200
I loved their songs.

10:13.201 --> 10:14.600
♪ If you wanna be my dum dum

10:14.601 --> 10:16.239
♪ You gotta get with my dum... ♪

10:16.240 --> 10:19.239
♪ Stop right now Thank you very dum

10:29.721 --> 10:33.119
♪ Mama, dum dum dum

10:33.120 --> 10:35.759
♪ Mama, dum dum... ♪

10:35.760 --> 10:37.799
Oh, bollocks, we've missed her.

10:37.800 --> 10:42.279
Taaj is one of FlyLo's roving ground crew.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.359
Today he's on buggy duty.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.199
'I've got wheels today, isn't it?'

10:46.200 --> 10:50.159
I get to just cruise round. I don't
got to walk nowhere, you get me?

10:50.160 --> 10:53.359
I just like to drive my
buggy, man, it's the coolest.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.319
I've got my sounds on, I've
got my bitches in the back.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.199
- Ladies, you watch Pimp My Ride?
- No.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.400
Man, I'm telling you,

11:00.401 --> 11:03.319
it would be so sick if I got
this buggy on Pimp My Ride.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.079
Get that Tim Westwood to
strip out the inside, yeah,

11:06.080 --> 11:08.999
put in a Maserati engine, fit
it up with the fattest tyres

11:09.000 --> 11:12.079
and then install one of them
special hydraulic suspension

11:12.080 --> 11:14.719
so that the whole machine
really bounces, yeah?

11:14.720 --> 11:17.039
But unfortunately I am unable to do that

11:17.040 --> 11:20.759
as the vehicle is the property
of the UK Aviation Authority.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.279
Ok, bitches, the pussy wagon has arrived!

11:24.280 --> 11:25.799
- Out you get.
- Thank you.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.559
I'm telling you, man, when
the ladies see me in this,

11:28.560 --> 11:30.520
they is gonna think I'm the coolest

11:30.521 --> 11:33.559
cos this is like the ultimate
fanny magnet, you get me?

11:33.560 --> 11:35.159
You get me? You do get me?

11:35.160 --> 11:37.879
Is of paramount
importance that you get me.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.920
You get me? You have me got? Good.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.839
Ian Foot is the airport's
Chief Immigration Officer.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.559
As an immigration officer,

11:48.560 --> 11:53.359
I am the first line of defence
of this country's borders.

11:53.360 --> 11:58.279
And, yes, I have been
accused of being a racist.

11:58.280 --> 12:02.639
But if being highly suspicious of
all foreigners makes you a racist,

12:02.640 --> 12:07.319
then, yeah, I mean, sure, lock
me up and throw away the key.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.639
Today, a question mark has arisen

12:09.640 --> 12:13.319
over the authenticity of
a passenger's passport.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.279
Now, the reason you
are being detained here

12:16.280 --> 12:19.679
is we're not satisfied you're
travelling on your own passport.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.719
According to your passport,
your name is Jennifer.

12:22.720 --> 12:26.600
You were born in Hampshire in 1998.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.280
That would make you a 12-year-old girl.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.159
There you go. That's gate
11, ok? Who's next, please?

12:35.160 --> 12:36.679
Meanwhile, back at Check-in,

12:36.680 --> 12:38.999
it's a very special day
for this happy couple.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.559
Where are you flying to today?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.559
- Disneyland!
- Los Angeles.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.639
We're getting married in Disneyland!

12:44.640 --> 12:47.799
- Ah, congratulations!
- Yeah, thanks.
- Just need to ask you

12:47.800 --> 12:51.079
some security questions. Did
you pack the cases yourselves?

12:51.080 --> 12:52.119
Yes, we did.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.919
Unfortunately, we didn't receive
any help from the seven dwarves.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.079
Do your bags contain any sharp objects?

12:58.080 --> 13:01.559
No, only the bare necessities.
We both love Disney,

13:01.560 --> 13:03.239
- don't we, Geoff?
- It's all right.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.080
We've brought a personal DVD player

13:05.081 --> 13:08.799
- so we can watch The
Aristocats on the flight.
- We watched that last night.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.519
But you have to watch The
Aristocats more than once

13:11.520 --> 13:13.999
to appreciate the
nuances. It's a great film.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.519
I shouldn't really like it because
I am actually allergic to cats.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.760
She comes out in a rash.

13:18.761 --> 13:22.439
But luckily these are cartoon cats
so they never come out the screen.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.159
When Bambi's mother died,
I cried for a fortnight.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.479
I'm not putting myself through that again.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.719
Look, can we go in there, in
case they've got something Disney?

13:30.720 --> 13:31.760
It's a chemist.

13:31.761 --> 13:34.919
They might have some Winnie
The Pooh panty pads. Come on.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.639
Why do I like Disney so much?

13:36.640 --> 13:40.679
Hmm, probably because I'm quite thick.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.279
Hi, can I get a latte, please?

13:42.280 --> 13:44.399
I'm sorry, my love, we got no coffee.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.799
You need to go to Terminal Two.
They've got a Starbuck there.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.759
Precious is one of the
airport's most familiar faces,

13:50.760 --> 13:54.799
having worked at this coffee
kiosk for over 20 years.

13:54.800 --> 13:59.599
- But today, she's having to close early.
- Well, we got no coffee.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.239
We're a coffee shop and we got no coffee.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.279
Me arrive here this morning to find

14:05.280 --> 14:07.879
a big tin of coffee
mysteriously disappeared.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.439
We got cup, we got spoon,
we got milk, we got sugar,

14:11.440 --> 14:15.159
we got water, we got
fire, but we got no coffee.

14:15.160 --> 14:19.039
The Lord in his Almighty wisdom has
decided to take the coffee from us

14:19.040 --> 14:23.199
so me got no option but
to close early. Closed.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.119
In a way, it is a blessing
because me got craving

14:26.120 --> 14:29.039
to go McDonald's and get
meself McEgg McMuffin.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.319
Praise the Lord for his 99p breakfasts!

14:32.320 --> 14:35.959
♪ Give me oil in my lamp Keep me burning

14:35.960 --> 14:39.039
♪ Give me oil in my lamp, I pray

14:39.040 --> 14:43.119
♪ Give me oil in my lamp Keep me burning

14:43.120 --> 14:47.160
♪ Keep me burning till the break of day. ♪

14:48.840 --> 14:50.599
After a difficult morning,

14:50.600 --> 14:55.199
Moses is looking forward to
greeting a very special passenger,

14:55.200 --> 14:57.119
92-year-old Hetty Wolf.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.119
I love looking after the elderly.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.479
I love hearing their stories, I
love hearing about the old days,

15:02.480 --> 15:04.759
and if you spend enough
time with old people,

15:04.760 --> 15:06.640
you eventually get used to the smell.

15:06.641 --> 15:09.919
Hello there, Mrs Wolf.
My name is Moses Beacon.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.599
Let me take that for you.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.519
My name is Hetty Wolf.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.959
I'm 92 years old and I
have never flown before.

15:17.960 --> 15:22.319
I've never been on an aeroplane,
so today is a very big day.

15:22.320 --> 15:26.439
I'm going to Florida to visit
my son Michael, who is a doctor.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.559
My son is a doctor.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.679
After accompanying Mrs
Wolf through Security,

15:31.680 --> 15:35.479
Moses is keen to help in any way he can.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.919
Right, do you need
anything from Duty Free?

15:37.920 --> 15:43.279
Yes, I'd like to buy a birthday
present for my grandson, Jonathan.

15:43.280 --> 15:47.479
- He will be 12 on Tuesday.
- Lovely! What would you like to get him?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.240
200 Lambert & Butler.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.999
Right. Well, I'll pop
and get those for you.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.519
Have you got any cash on you?

15:55.520 --> 15:58.159
- Hmm?
- For the cigarettes?

15:58.160 --> 16:00.839
No, I put my money in the suitcase.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.479
You put your money in your suitcase?

16:03.480 --> 16:06.199
Yes, I thought this is
what you are supposed to do.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.760
I have never flown before.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.919
Well, Moses Beacon likes
to go the extra mile

16:14.920 --> 16:18.639
so I'll buy them for you and you
can pay me back when you fly home.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.359
- How about that?
- Yes,

16:20.360 --> 16:22.839
if I remember.

16:22.840 --> 16:28.919
- Oh, I would also like to buy him
two bottles of Bell's Whisky.
- Right.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.440
Large!

16:32.080 --> 16:33.479
Oh, Mrs Wolf,

16:33.480 --> 16:36.119
she's quite a character,
if you'll pardon the pun.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.599
She's had me running
hither and thither and...

16:38.600 --> 16:41.240
Hurry up! We need to go to Hermes.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.559
With the morning flights on
their way, FlyLo check-in girls

16:46.560 --> 16:48.959
Melody and Keeley are
on their lunch break.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.479
- How's it going with your boyfriend?
- Which one?

16:51.480 --> 16:53.759
- Craig.
- Black Craig or white Craig?

16:53.760 --> 16:55.959
- White Craig.
- He's in prison.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.479
- What for?
- Beating up black Craig.

16:58.480 --> 17:03.759
But check-in boss Helen is about
to impart some important news.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.839
Hi, girls. Have you got a minute?

17:05.840 --> 17:09.239
- Can it wait?
- We're still on lunch.
- I've got some news for you.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.999
I'm pregnant.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.079
Oh, congratulations!

17:13.080 --> 17:17.479
- Oh, aye, I'm dead made up for yous.
- What are you, seven months gone?

17:17.480 --> 17:19.039
No, no, no, I'm three months.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.199
- Was it artificial insemination?
- No!

17:21.200 --> 17:23.040
Not a gay guy with a turkey baster?

17:23.041 --> 17:27.159
- No, it was the normal
way, with my husband.
- You've got a husband?!

17:27.160 --> 17:30.279
- Just goes to show, not all men
are obsessed with looks.
- Yeah.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.559
Right, well, I'm going to be
taking maternity leave soon

17:33.560 --> 17:35.679
so I guess one of you two will be asked

17:35.680 --> 17:37.640
to take over as Check-in Manager.

17:39.640 --> 17:40.880
Catch you later.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.639
"Me and Keeley are bezzy mates."

17:44.640 --> 17:46.159
"Yeah, we're like sisters."

17:46.160 --> 17:48.159
Yeah, she's like me much older sister.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.440
Yeah, what she means is,

17:49.441 --> 17:52.199
I did actually start at
FlyLo a week before she did,

17:52.200 --> 17:55.079
so I imagine Helen'll be
putting me up for the promotion.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.559
Or they may go for a much
younger, fresher face.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.639
Whatever happens, I know we'll
always remain bezzy mates.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.319
- In a way, I think you should get it.
- You should get it.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.280
- No, you should get it.
- You should get it.

18:05.281 --> 18:07.280
- You should get it.
- You should get it.

18:07.281 --> 18:10.239
- She should get it.
- You should get it.
- You should get it.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.399
Ok.

18:12.400 --> 18:17.239
Simon and Jackie Trent are Britain's
first husband-and-wife pilot team.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.999
Set heading zero nine two.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.599
Heading zero nine two set.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.799
- Set speed four seven zero.
- Speed four seven zero.
- Set...

18:23.800 --> 18:27.399
- I haven't finished setting
the speed yet, Simon.
- Sorry, I thought...

18:27.400 --> 18:29.559
Can we just do one
thing at a time, please?

18:29.560 --> 18:32.079
Yeah. Right, the speed is set.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.359
I've been flying commercially for 15 years

18:34.360 --> 18:35.919
and Jackie was a dental nurse.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.199
Dental hygienist! There is a difference.

18:38.220 --> 18:40.819
You do know that,
Simon. He does know that.

18:40.820 --> 18:45.059
And then Jackie felt she wanted
to retrain and become a pilot.

18:45.060 --> 18:46.739
He had an affair.

18:46.740 --> 18:50.099
He had an affair with
one of the stewardesses.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.499
It wasn't an affair. It
was a one-night thing.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.699
- That makes it worse.
- How does that make it worse?
- It just does.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.899
I did what any woman would do.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.179
I spent five years retraining as a pilot

19:00.180 --> 19:02.539
and now I come on all
the flights with him.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.779
We decided it was the best way forward.

19:04.780 --> 19:08.179
- You decided it...
- Please don't undermine
me all the time, Simon!

19:08.180 --> 19:11.779
Yes, five years later, here I
am, qualified as the First Officer

19:11.780 --> 19:13.260
and it saved our marriage.

19:13.261 --> 19:16.380
It's allowed us to trust
each other again, hasn't it?

19:18.220 --> 19:19.260
Yup.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.139
Where are you going, Simon?

19:22.140 --> 19:25.499
- I'm just going to the toilet.
- You went to the toilet over Norway.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.659
- That was an hour ago.
- Who are you going
to be talking to, Simon?

19:28.660 --> 19:31.380
Who are you going to be
screwing in the toilet?!

19:33.460 --> 19:35.219
"Well, it's not always easy,

19:35.220 --> 19:38.179
you know, living
together, working together."

19:38.180 --> 19:41.139
"We have squabbles like
any married couple."

19:41.140 --> 19:45.499
Well, like any married couple
when one of them's had an affair.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.259
Well, I didn't know that, did I?

19:47.260 --> 19:50.779
This passenger is due to fly to
Malaga for his sister's wedding,

19:50.780 --> 19:52.060
but there's a problem.

19:52.061 --> 19:54.139
He can't find his passport.

19:54.140 --> 19:57.019
- Well, I've got me Nectar Card. Any good?
- Sorry, sir.

19:57.020 --> 19:58.699
It's clearly got my name on it.

19:58.700 --> 20:02.299
When you arrive without a passport,
they'll send you straight back.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.019
- Even if I show them my
Boots Advantage Card?
- Sorry.

20:05.020 --> 20:06.659
- Blockbuster Video Card?
- No.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.659
- Dudley Swimming Baths Pass?
- Sorry.

20:08.660 --> 20:09.860
What if I get to Spain

20:09.861 --> 20:12.459
and get them to call
Dudley Swimming Baths?

20:12.460 --> 20:15.579
The lady there can vouch for
me and say, "Yeah, it's Neil."

20:15.580 --> 20:17.979
I'm sorry, sir, but you
do need your passport.

20:17.980 --> 20:20.379
All right, all right, I get it.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.900
Oh, hang on a sec.

20:23.420 --> 20:24.900
Thorpe Park Family Pass!

20:26.020 --> 20:27.059
Come on!

20:27.060 --> 20:28.699
"Well, this is madness."

20:28.700 --> 20:30.979
Apparently you have to have a passport now

20:30.980 --> 20:32.340
to go to another country.

20:32.341 --> 20:33.939
Excuse me, but I wasn't told.

20:33.940 --> 20:35.539
That's FlyLo for you, isn't it?

20:35.540 --> 20:39.019
Happy to take your money, but
forget your passport and that's that.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.900
Hope you've all got your passports!

20:40.901 --> 20:43.459
Apparently you now need
a passport to go abroad!

20:43.460 --> 20:46.340
I'm never flying FlyLo
again! You couldn't pay me!

20:48.460 --> 20:50.900
Found me passport. It
was just in me pocket.

21:01.140 --> 21:06.619
It's 4.00pm and Mrs Wolf'
flight is ready for boarding...

21:06.620 --> 21:10.659
- Nearly there...
- so Moses guides her to
the departure lounge.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.859
Young man, I'm very nervous

21:12.860 --> 21:17.939
about sitting in the middle of
the plane or the back of the plane.

21:17.940 --> 21:22.379
I would be much happier sitting
in the front of the plane,

21:22.380 --> 21:24.019
in first class.

21:24.020 --> 21:27.219
But you do have an
economy-class ticket, Mrs Wolf.

21:27.220 --> 21:31.459
Yes, but you tell them, you tell
them that I have never flown before

21:31.460 --> 21:33.539
and I'm very nervous

21:33.540 --> 21:38.099
and they must put me in the first
class with the free champagne.

21:38.100 --> 21:42.259
Unfortunately, it's not Great British
Air policy to offer free upgrades.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.579
Yes, but you will tell them for me.

21:44.580 --> 21:47.579
I'll call my supervisor
and see what I can do.

21:47.580 --> 21:49.819
Yes, you do it now.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.340
Quickly!

21:54.420 --> 21:57.779
My son is a doctor.

21:57.780 --> 22:02.859
These two Japanese schoolgirls have
flown almost 6,000 miles from Tokyo

22:02.860 --> 22:04.499
just to meet their idol.

22:04.500 --> 22:08.419
- We like Martin Clune.
- We love Martin Clune.

22:08.420 --> 22:11.539
We seen him first in his show Men Badly.

22:11.540 --> 22:15.779
He so cute. We also see him in
William and alongside him Mary.

22:15.780 --> 22:16.980
They're my best show.

22:16.981 --> 22:20.099
I like him in Doctor Martins,
where he plays Doctor Martins.

22:20.100 --> 22:24.019
We found out on the Twitter that he
landing here at this airport today!

22:24.020 --> 22:26.659
He number one star in Japan.
All the girls love him.

22:26.660 --> 22:29.499
So we bring lots of
gift for Martin Clunes.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.580
Yeah, we show you.

22:30.581 --> 22:34.579
We bring official Martin Clune
breakfast cereal, Clune Pops.

22:34.580 --> 22:37.659
- I like him with long hair.
- I like him with short hair.

22:37.660 --> 22:42.259
And we bring official
Reggie Perrin lunchbox.

22:42.260 --> 22:45.419
And we bring a doll of
Martin Clune for Martin Clune.

22:45.420 --> 22:47.379
"Konnichiwa, Martin Clunes."

22:47.380 --> 22:50.699
And we have made up a song for
Martin Clune. We do the song!

22:50.700 --> 22:53.419
- No, too shy, too shy.
- No, we do the song, we do the song!

22:53.420 --> 22:57.099
- No, too shy, too shy!
- No, we do it, we do it, we do it!

22:57.100 --> 22:58.380
Ok, we do the song now.

22:58.381 --> 23:00.059
No, no, too shy, too shy, too shy.

23:00.060 --> 23:03.020
No, we do the song. We said we
do the song, so we do the song.

Taaj is nearing the end of his shift,

23:48.381 --> 23:52.780
but there's one more thing he wants
to do while he still has the buggy.

23:54.860 --> 23:57.979
- Hey, Lisa, does you want a ride?
- It's all right, thank you.

23:57.980 --> 23:59.619
- Oh, go on.
- No, I'm fine.

23:59.620 --> 24:02.179
Oh, go on, babes, I got
the wagon today, isn't it?

24:02.180 --> 24:04.299
Come on, get on the pussy wagon.

24:04.300 --> 24:05.619
Come on.

24:05.620 --> 24:07.700
Ok.

24:08.700 --> 24:11.299
Wicked. So where do you want to go?

24:11.300 --> 24:13.899
- The check-in desk.
- Ok.

24:16.820 --> 24:19.300
- There you go.
- Thank you.

24:20.340 --> 24:21.419
Right.

24:21.420 --> 24:24.219
That check-in girl is fit

24:24.220 --> 24:25.899
and I well reckon she fancies me,

24:25.900 --> 24:28.099
but the journey wasn't quite long enough

24:28.100 --> 24:30.020
so I didn't get a chance to cop a feel.

24:30.021 --> 24:35.139
Back at Immigration, Ian's
investigations are continuing.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.539
Well, what I've done is I've
taken a photo of our friend here.

24:38.540 --> 24:41.099
I've noticed there are
a number of differences.

24:41.100 --> 24:44.019
In this photograph, he has a beard.

24:44.020 --> 24:46.099
In this photo, he does not.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.139
In this photo,

24:47.140 --> 24:52.259
the skin is dark in tone. In
this photo, it's a lot paler.

24:52.260 --> 24:54.779
In this photograph, there is a man,

24:54.780 --> 24:58.380
whereas in this photograph,
there is a little girl.

25:00.220 --> 25:02.660
Also, the ears are different, so...

25:03.700 --> 25:05.060
Right, what I'm going to do,

25:05.061 --> 25:08.779
I'm going to let you in this
time, but with a warning.

25:08.780 --> 25:11.580
You really do need to update
your passport photograph.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.780
Take care, Jennifer.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.619
It's five o'clock and Precious
is still at the airport.

25:20.620 --> 25:24.419
Oh, hello, petal, how are you?

25:24.420 --> 25:27.859
I'm very good, thank you.
I've had a very busy afternoon.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.699
I've been to Dixon and
bought an alarm clock radio

25:30.700 --> 25:33.179
for to listen to the
Lord's song on a Sunday.

25:33.180 --> 25:36.619
I've been to W Smith because
they've got a special deal on...

25:36.620 --> 25:40.739
Ok, Now and Closer,
three magazine for £2.95.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.899
Praise the Lord for the multipack!

25:42.900 --> 25:46.099
And I've been to Past Time,
but there's not very much there.

25:46.100 --> 25:47.819
It's mainly just shortbread.

25:47.820 --> 25:51.499
Well, all this shopping has made me
very tired so I just need to pick up

25:51.500 --> 25:55.379
some bath and shower gel and go
home and have a bath and shower.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.019
Thank you, Gerald.

25:57.020 --> 26:00.139
Take me now to Boot The Chemist, please.

26:00.140 --> 26:02.459
Good man.

Lavinia, your tights is falling down!

26:09.780 --> 26:12.779
Thank you so much. Happy flighting.

26:12.780 --> 26:17.419
Meanwhile at the departure gate,
Moses is pulling out all the stops

26:17.420 --> 26:20.139
to get an upgrade for
his elderly passenger.

26:20.140 --> 26:23.219
Mrs Wolf, I've just
spoken to my supervisor

26:23.220 --> 26:25.739
and explained that it's
your first ever flight,

26:25.740 --> 26:27.899
but he said there was nothing he could do,

26:27.900 --> 26:31.299
so what I've done is, I've
used my own personal Airmiles

26:31.300 --> 26:34.660
and I've managed to get you
an upgrade to first class.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.700
I'm eating.

26:44.780 --> 26:48.339
If you'd just like to wait
here one second, Mrs Wolf.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.539
- Right, now I've got your
cigarettes and your whisky.
- For my grandson.

26:52.540 --> 26:54.419
- Yes.
- Not me.

26:54.420 --> 26:58.619
No. And the other things I
put on my credit card for you,

26:58.620 --> 27:01.099
the Yves Saint Laurent scarf, the iPad

27:01.100 --> 27:04.139
- and the giant Toblerone.
- Yes.

27:04.140 --> 27:07.619
And I'd just like to say from all
of us here at Great British Air,

27:07.620 --> 27:10.619
we wish you a very
happy first ever flight.

27:10.620 --> 27:13.340
- There we are.
- Yes.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.219
Bye-bye.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.780
Happy flighting.

27:22.060 --> 27:25.899
Oh, I just remembered, I
have actually flown before.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.420
Many times. Goodbye.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.339
If I ever see that woman again,

27:34.340 --> 27:36.460
I will kick her in the face.

27:38.180 --> 27:41.339
The sun sets on another day,

27:41.340 --> 27:44.379
but the airport never sleeps.

27:44.380 --> 27:47.819
What's your favourite live-action
Disney film from the late '60s?

27:47.820 --> 27:50.299
Sue and Geoff had their
wedding in Disneyland

27:50.300 --> 27:53.219
and consummated their
marriage on the Peter Pan ride.

27:53.220 --> 27:56.659
Basil The Great Mouse Detective
was a fine movie, did you see that?

27:56.660 --> 27:57.699
It's not good.

27:57.700 --> 28:00.859
Simon and Jackie are still
trying to patch things up.

28:00.860 --> 28:02.379
What's for dinner tonight?

28:02.380 --> 28:03.900
- Chilli con carne.
- Ok.

28:05.460 --> 28:08.619
I know you don't like it,
but I do, so we're having it.

28:08.620 --> 28:12.459
And Martin Clunes heard his
Japanese fans were waiting for him

28:12.460 --> 28:15.099
so had his plane diverted to RAF Northolt.

28:18.100 --> 28:20.860
- Why?!
- Oh...
