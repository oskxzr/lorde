00:01.000 --> 00:05.240
This series looks at life in
one of Britain's busiest airports.

00:05.240 --> 00:08.710
On today's show - Peter and
Judith demand their money back.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.000
What would Jesus do
in this situation?

00:11.010 --> 00:11.520
Jesus?

00:11.520 --> 00:14.080
Jesus would give us a full refund.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.160
Melody explains why
she should be promoted.

00:17.160 --> 00:21.080
If you work at check-in you really
do need to be a people person.

00:21.080 --> 00:25.080
I am very good with people
because I am myself a person.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.560
And there's some last-minute
holiday advice from Taaj.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.280
If you haven't got Sky Plus in your
hotel, you don't want to go at all.

00:31.280 --> 00:34.280
If you have, just stay at home and
watch Sky Plus. It's better, innit?

01:06.760 --> 01:12.400
It's 8am, and over at the FlyLo desks
it's check-in manager Helen's last day.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.900
But competition for her position

01:13.910 --> 01:17.160
has caused tension between
best friends Melody and Keeley.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.400
Next, please.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.280
And Melody has chosen
the worst possible day to be late.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.670
Melody, you were
two hours late this morning.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.680
Yeah, I'm sorry,
Helen, I just...

01:25.680 --> 01:30.240
It's not going to count against her
for promotion, is it? I really hope not.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.640
No, I don't think it will.

01:31.740 --> 01:36.040
Melody, I really, really hope it
doesn't count against you for promotion.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.640
Thanks.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.840
Meanwhile, in departures,

01:38.840 --> 01:42.640
these FlyLo passengers
are also having a bad day.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.600
They can't find the right gate
for their flight to Greece.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.920
Fortunately,
Taaj is on hand to help.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.020
- Excuse me, mate?
- Yes, boss?

01:49.030 --> 01:50.920
Which gate's the
flight to Athens?

01:50.920 --> 01:53.160
Can I see your
boarding pass, please?

01:54.160 --> 01:56.240
Yeah, it's already taken off, mate.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.040
What do you mean? It's not supposed
to leave for another hour.

01:59.040 --> 01:59.900
Yeah, but it left early.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.660
What's the point of it leaving early?

02:01.660 --> 02:03.560
Well you see the thing is,
FlyLo have had a lot of

02:03.560 --> 02:06.680
complaints recently because some
of their flights has been delayed,

02:06.680 --> 02:08.370
so we're trying to get some
other ones away early

02:08.380 --> 02:10.420
in order to redress
the balance, isn't it?

02:10.420 --> 02:11.630
Was anyone on the flight?

02:11.630 --> 02:14.620
Yeah, the pilot, the co-pilot
and one of the stewards.

02:14.630 --> 02:15.720
Anyone else?

02:15.920 --> 02:18.120
No, I think that was it.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.020
You can't please some people.

02:19.020 --> 02:21.560
First they is moaning that
the flights is late,

02:21.560 --> 02:24.800
now they is moaning that
the flights is early. You can't win.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.560
It's 10am, and in international
arrivals the airport paparazzi

02:28.560 --> 02:33.200
are reflecting on what may turn out
to be a career-ending incident.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.400
I'll tell you what happened.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.400
He's not allowed to take
photos here no more.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.000
He's been a naughty boy, ain't ya?

02:39.100 --> 02:40.560
It was an accident.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.040
He done the old up-the-skirt shot
on Dame Judi Dench.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.880
What happened was was,
Dame Judi come through,

02:46.880 --> 02:51.520
I tripped, fell to the floor,
camera went off in me hand.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.510
And it was an accident, was it?

02:52.520 --> 02:55.240
I swear on my mother's life.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.920
God rest her soul.

02:56.920 --> 03:01.880
Next thing I know, front page of
the Daily Star...Dame Judi's drawers.

03:01.880 --> 03:06.800
Dame Judi done a complaint and
that's that, licence took off me.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.400
He'll never work again.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.300
A few minutes later,

03:10.300 --> 03:15.000
Mickey is back at work when Buster
spots an incoming celebrity.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.740
Look, it's that woman
from Big Brother.

03:16.750 --> 03:19.480
Hello, Professor Greer,
lovely to see you again.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.170
Nice holiday?

03:20.180 --> 03:24.240
- It was a lecture tour actually,
- Oh, all sounds very intellectual.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.000
Mind if I take a quick snap?
Won't take a mo.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.400
Get a sexy one.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.200
Yeah, all right.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.800
Get her to look over
her shoulder, like this.

03:31.800 --> 03:32.240
Shut up!

03:32.700 --> 03:34.300
- Get her to show a bit of leg.
- Buster!

03:34.300 --> 03:36.240
Do you always
talk to women like that?

03:36.240 --> 03:39.000
What are you, one of these feminists?

03:39.000 --> 03:45.120
Well, as a matter of fact I am,
and you are a revolting man.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.320
Well, you're not going to sell
THOSE to Nuts Magazine.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.400
- You've ruined that!
- I was trying to help.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.400
You're not helping at all.
You're in the way!

03:52.400 --> 03:54.100
- What am I meant to do?
- I don't care!

03:54.200 --> 03:57.880
You're not allowed to take pictures
any more, are ya? Just...get lost!

04:05.080 --> 04:06.360
Amateur!

04:06.360 --> 04:09.040
Pervert!

04:09.040 --> 04:12.360
Our Lady Air runs a Steward
of the Year competition.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.360
And Fearghal is going
all out to win it.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.860
It's all part of the
service there, sir,

04:16.860 --> 04:19.840
and I can really style it
for you if you like.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.600
There's a way that Justin Bieber
does it that he really likes.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.150
If you want to be number one,
you've got to realise

04:24.150 --> 04:27.640
that there's more to this job
than just handing out hot towels.

04:27.640 --> 04:31.400
You've got to be a nurse, you've
got to be a children's entertainer,

04:31.400 --> 04:35.120
you've got to be a...travel guide,
you've got to be a counsellor,

04:35.120 --> 04:37.400
you've got to be a midwife,
you've got to be an interpreter,

04:37.420 --> 04:39.960
you've got to be a
hedge fund manager,

04:39.960 --> 04:42.460
you've got to be a pig breeder,
you've got to be a toilet cleaner,

04:42.560 --> 04:45.000
you've got to be a holy man,
but most of all...

04:45.400 --> 04:47.920
you've got to be a friend.

04:47.920 --> 04:52.000
Oh, and you're also expected to
give hand relief to the pilot.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.080
I've got a crying child,
row 37. Crying child.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.980
I always try and do my best
for passengers anyway,

04:57.980 --> 05:00.080
but if you wanna win
Steward of the Year

05:00.080 --> 05:02.960
it does really help if you've
done something brave or heroic.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.010
Like last year's winner,
Seamus O'Shaughnessy,

05:05.010 --> 05:06.720
he delivered a baby on board.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.000
So, fingers crossed,

05:08.020 --> 05:10.760
one of my passengers will have
a heart attack or something.

05:10.760 --> 05:14.080
Hot nuts? Hot nuts? Hot nuts?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.640
No, thank you. I'm allergic.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.760
- Really?
- Yes, I can't go anywhere near them.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.840
And, er, what would happen
if you were to have a nut?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.760
Well, my throat would swell up
and I'd be unable to breathe.

05:24.760 --> 05:29.280
In fact, I have to carry one of these
EpiPens so people can inject me.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.800
Really?

05:32.880 --> 05:34.360
Hmm...

05:34.360 --> 05:37.120
Can you move out the way
please, madam? OK, sir.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.960
Moments later, a passenger has been
taken seriously ill on Fearghal's flight

05:40.960 --> 05:44.480
and the plane has been forced
to make an emergency landing.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.680
OK, what's your name, sir?
Your name? Just call...

05:46.680 --> 05:49.480
We'll just call him Mr Nuts.
He's called Mr Nuts, OK?

05:49.480 --> 05:52.000
'Something very dramatic
just happened.'

05:52.000 --> 05:55.400
One of the passengers on board
has a severe allergy to nuts

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
and he fell asleep

05:56.400 --> 06:00.000
and somehow a handful of
hot nuts fell into his mouth.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.520
Fortunately I was on hand to
administer a life-saving injection.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.440
He's gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK!

06:06.440 --> 06:07.920
He's gonna be OK.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.360
Did you get that?

06:09.360 --> 06:11.360
Some passengers are
calling me a hero.

06:11.360 --> 06:15.120
Not the man himself, he's still
drifting in and out of consciousness,

06:15.120 --> 06:17.760
but I just did what any
good steward would do. OK?

06:17.760 --> 06:20.560
You know, I don't need an
award for saving a man's life.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.000
Just doing a good deed
is an award in itself.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.100
Having said that, obviously,

06:25.100 --> 06:29.440
if they did offer me an award,
I would turn up and accept it.

06:29.440 --> 06:33.360
Back at FlyLo, Helen is
saying her final farewells.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.920
Well...this is it, then.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.000
I've, erm, really enjoyed
working with you girls.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.120
So I've just come to say goodbye.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.200
Bye.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.000
I'll text you
when I've had the baby.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.760
If you want.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.760
And I'll e-mail you pictures
of the baby if you like.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.960
Yes...don't worry.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.040
See you, then.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.880
Have a good baby.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.920
Helen! I hope you manage
to lose all the baby weight!

07:17.240 --> 07:18.760
She won't.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.360
Over 80 million pieces of luggage
pass through the airport every year.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.740
It's the job of Customs Officer
Steve Downes and his dog Bobo

07:29.760 --> 07:32.680
to ensure none of
them contain drugs.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.480
Come on, it's just a camera.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.660
My training method's very simple.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.760
I teach the dog to sniff out
illegal substances

07:38.760 --> 07:41.200
and I give him
a little bit as a reward.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.880
All right? There you go. Good lad.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.560
Good lad. That was just a
little slither of crack there.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.720
Do you want some more? Course you do.

07:50.720 --> 07:55.000
I started working with dogs in the
armed forces, in the Bomb Disposal Unit.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.200
I served in Afghanistan.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.960
My job was to train
the dogs to sniff out bombs.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.160
Same principle: the dog
would find the bomb,

08:03.160 --> 08:06.760
I would give the dog the bomb
to play with as a reward.

08:06.760 --> 08:10.640
I'm glad I got out when I did,
though. I...saw some terrible things.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.320
I saw Jim Davidson live,

08:13.320 --> 08:17.320
I saw James Blunt do an acoustic set
at the base in Helmand Province,

08:17.320 --> 08:19.360
in which he sang Beautiful twice,

08:19.360 --> 08:23.240
and...I think perhaps worst of all...

08:23.240 --> 08:25.720
I saw Ross Kemp take a shower.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.960
Still have nightmares about that.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.920
I've had a number of
canine companions over the years.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.200
This is my first one, Princess.
Excellent sniffer dog.

08:34.200 --> 08:38.160
But she ended up sniffing cocaine and
couldn't stop. She's now in rehab.

08:38.160 --> 08:41.560
This is Pickles. Pickles
developed a taste for cannabis.

08:41.560 --> 08:43.160
Always had the munchies.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.000
The weight ballooned.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.600
Now she has to be carted around
in a wheelbarrow. Very sad.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.600
This is Molly. Top sniffer dog,
but...heroin.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.600
First she started smoking it,
then injecting it.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.680
Last I heard she was
selling her body to get drugs.

08:56.680 --> 09:01.080
Muffin. LSD,
thought she could fly. Splat.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.880
We have a joke amongst
some of the lads here.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.880
"My dog's got no nose."
"How does he smell?"

09:06.880 --> 09:08.720
"Well, unfortunately, he can't smell,

09:08.720 --> 09:10.920
"because he's sniffed so
many drugs over the years

09:10.920 --> 09:14.920
"that he's pretty much obliterated
the entire olfactory system.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.720
"His septum has
practically dissolved.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.000
"We're going to have to early
retirement, see if a farm will take him,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.720
"and, if they won't, we'll just
probably have him put down."

09:24.720 --> 09:28.020
It's 11:30, and at the
France Airways check-in

09:28.020 --> 09:31.080
two passengers are
becoming very angry.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.160
Obviously we are not going to
wield the swords on the plane!

09:34.160 --> 09:35.760
- We are from the BMBRS!
- The what?

09:35.760 --> 09:38.360
The British Medieval
Battle Re-enactment Society.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.000
You are not allowed to take
dangerous weapons onto the plane.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.600
Yes, but we need to get
the swords to Paris

09:42.600 --> 09:45.800
because we are re-enacting the
battle of Agincourt on Wednesday.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.680
- These items are forbidden.
- This is racism, isn't it?

09:48.680 --> 09:50.640
- Excuse me?
- We beat you at Agincourt.

09:50.640 --> 09:54.140
Approximately 9,000 of our men defeated
approximately 36,000 of yours.

09:54.140 --> 09:55.040
I don't understand.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.000
Battle of Agincourt?
1415?, Henry Five?

09:57.040 --> 09:59.920
I imagine they didn't teach
you about that at your "Ecole".

09:59.920 --> 10:02.680
One of the many glorious
English victories over the French.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.280
Cry God for Harry,
England and St George.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.280
I'm sorry?

10:05.280 --> 10:07.380
I told you France Airways was a
mistake, Peasant Swordsman Gavin.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.560
You DID want me to
use my Nectar points.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.460
Listen, wench, will you let us
on board with the swords or not?

10:11.560 --> 10:12.560
Non!

10:12.560 --> 10:16.440
What if we do that thing where we
wrap them in lots and lots and lots

10:16.440 --> 10:19.140
and lots and lots and lots and lots
and lots and lots of cling film?

10:19.140 --> 10:20.200
Non.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.480
What are we meant to do,
leave them here?

10:22.480 --> 10:24.020
Perhaps you have
a wife or girlfriend

10:24.020 --> 10:26.120
who could come and
pick them up for you?

10:26.120 --> 10:29.640
Look at us, we obviously
do not have wives or girlfriends.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.040
There are other people here. Would
you like me to check you in or not?

10:32.040 --> 10:35.750
We cannot accurately recreate
the battle of Agincourt

10:35.740 --> 10:37.960
without authentic weaponry!!

10:38.960 --> 10:41.040
I'm sorry.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.520
I cannot help you.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.560
Fine. Have it your way.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.750
But next time the Germans invade your
country and you immediately surrender

10:47.750 --> 10:49.920
don't expect us to help you out.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.560
Good day.

10:51.560 --> 10:55.920
'The whole thing is absurd,
it's patently absurd.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.880
'I mean, a sword is only a dangerous
weapon in the wrong hands.'

10:59.880 --> 11:01.440
Un moment, s'il vous plait.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.560
Just forgot our swords.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.720
'I've been re-enacting for 14 years.'

11:05.720 --> 11:07.420
I've taken part in
hundreds of battles,

11:07.420 --> 11:11.600
and in that time I've only
accidentally killed two people.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.400
What about Trevor?

11:12.400 --> 11:16.120
Well...he died three weeks
later in hospital.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.760
I don't feel I can be
held accountable for that.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.440
Meanwhile, in baggage handling,

11:23.440 --> 11:26.680
John and Terry are
enjoying a well-earned rest.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.400
I've been working here so long I've
developed a sort of sixth sense.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.480
I have! I can just look
at a piece of luggage

11:32.500 --> 11:35.480
and tell you exactly what
sort of person owns it.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.400
- Can't I, boy?
- Not really, Dad.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.360
Yeah. Like, watch this, right.

11:39.360 --> 11:43.360
See this one? I reckon that bag
belongs to...a man.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.040
Check the label.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.760
- "Barry Edwards."
- See?

11:46.760 --> 11:53.000
Or...this one, I would say, belongs
to a woman. Check the label.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.440
- "Susan Williams."
- See, I'm good, ain't I?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.880
- Yeah, amazing, Dad.
- Yeah, or this one here.

11:58.880 --> 12:04.000
Very interesting. I would say that
belongs to someone who likes golf.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.560
Yeah, a fan of the sport golf.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.760
Someone who enjoys watching it
or playing it. Check the label.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.760
- "Nick Faldo."
- See, it's a gift.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.320
Yeah, are we done yet, Dad?

12:12.320 --> 12:14.880
No, no, boy, I'm on a roll,
I'm on a roll. Here we go.

12:14.880 --> 12:20.880
Yeah, now, this belongs to either
a little girl or a midget queer.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.760
"Frances Banks."

12:22.760 --> 12:24.400
We'll never know.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.240
It's midday, and rumours about
who's going to get the promotion

12:28.240 --> 12:31.080
are buzzing round
the FlyLo check-in desk.

12:31.080 --> 12:34.280
We still don't know which one of us
is going to be check-in manager.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.200
- I do.
- What?

12:36.200 --> 12:38.040
I've been told.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.620
What have you been told?

12:39.640 --> 12:43.160
I've been told who's got it,
but I've been asked as a courtesy

12:43.160 --> 12:48.320
to wait until it's officially announced
at 5 o'clock, and I can celebrate then.

12:48.320 --> 12:52.840
Ian Foot has been Chief Immigration
Officer at the airport for ten years

12:52.840 --> 12:55.800
and in that time he's seen
a lot of changes.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.960
Unfortunately, in this day and age,
you have to be as careful

12:58.960 --> 13:03.560
with the people that work in the
airport as those who are arriving,

13:03.560 --> 13:05.600
so I do spot checks on the staff.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.700
I select them at random,
bring them in,

13:07.700 --> 13:11.600
go through their documentation,
ask them a few questions.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.000
Well, when I say "at random",

13:13.100 --> 13:16.100
it's only actually
the black and brown ones.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.560
I don't bother with
the yellow people.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.360
I find the yellow people
no trouble at all.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.840
Very meek.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.440
Right, can I see your passport?

13:25.440 --> 13:26.060
This afternoon,

13:26.060 --> 13:30.360
it's the turn of FlyLo Ground Crew
member Taaj to be interviewed.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.060
This is a British passport.
You're obviously not British.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.200
Yeah, I am.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.200
Well, we'll see about that,
"Taaj Mansour". Ha.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.240
Right, where were you born?

13:39.240 --> 13:40.440
Bradford.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.080
All right, where
were you parents born?

13:42.080 --> 13:44.160
Oh, sorry. Sheffield.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.640
All right, where were their
parents originally from?

13:46.640 --> 13:47.640
Pakistan.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.840
Pakistan! We're getting somewhere.

13:49.840 --> 13:53.640
Right, so if there was a cricket
match between England and Pakistan,

13:53.640 --> 13:54.880
who would you support?

13:54.880 --> 13:58.080
- I don't like cricket.
- Well, which sports do you like?

13:58.080 --> 14:00.320
- BMX.
- Anything else?

14:00.320 --> 14:03.040
Cage-fighting, man!
I love cage-fighting, man.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.720
Did you see it on Saturday on Sky?
There was this wicked fight, right,

14:06.720 --> 14:10.600
because this one guy was being really
cheeky, he was giving it all of that.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.500
But like the other guy came in
and mashed up his face, man!

14:12.500 --> 14:15.360
It was like a plate of meat at
the end of it, man. It was crazy.

14:15.360 --> 14:18.360
All right, so, if
there was a cage fight

14:18.360 --> 14:20.960
between an Englishman
and a Pakistanian,

14:20.960 --> 14:23.480
whose face would you
like to see mashed up?

14:23.480 --> 14:26.080
But there isn't any cage fighters
from Pakistan, isn't it?

14:26.080 --> 14:29.640
I think there's one from the Wirral.
Called something like Strange Reg.

14:30.640 --> 14:34.240
OK, how many times a week,
on average, do you eat curry?

14:34.240 --> 14:35.640
Oh, no, I don't like curry.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.840
No, I prefer English food,
you get me, like pizza or Chinese.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.760
What is your chosen faith?

14:41.760 --> 14:45.640
I would have to say George Michael's
version probably still the best.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.160
Final question. Do you have
a connection to Al-Qaeda?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.760
Never met the guy.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.080
Oh, no, that name does ring a bell.

14:55.080 --> 14:55.999
Yes?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.040
I think he's one of
my friends on Facebook.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.720
- Is you on Facebook?
- Yes, I am on Facebook.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.520
Tell me your name, man,
I'll come along and poke you.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.600
I don't want to be poked
by people like you.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.400
I'm British, I'm proud of it,
you get me?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.760
That guy should not even
be in that job.

15:10.760 --> 15:15.520
He has a racist agenda, which in this
day and age is totally unacceptable.

15:17.040 --> 15:20.960
Still at least it got me off work
for half an hour, though, isn't it?

15:20.960 --> 15:23.320
Oh, he called me a racist, did he?

15:23.320 --> 15:26.920
Well, that in itself...
is anti-white, right?

15:26.920 --> 15:29.800
As far as I'm concerned,
he poses a very real threat,

15:29.820 --> 15:32.760
and as such I'm going
to mark his file Code Red

15:32.760 --> 15:34.300
and add his name to a list of people

15:34.300 --> 15:38.000
I feel threaten the
security of this country.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.320
Also on the list are
Hardeep Singh Kohli...

15:41.320 --> 15:43.600
Mark Ramprakash...

15:43.600 --> 15:45.840
and Konnie Huq.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.460
It's proving to be another long day for
FlyLo owner Omar Baba,

15:52.460 --> 15:55.760
who's all over the
front pages again.

15:55.760 --> 15:59.280
Serious allegations of sexual
harassment have hit the front pages,

15:59.280 --> 16:02.760
with several FlyLo employees going
on record with their complaints.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.920
Mr Baba did not physically touch me

16:04.920 --> 16:09.120
but he did once make a verbal
comment that I had very nice breasts

16:09.120 --> 16:14.520
and that he would like to
put his head between them
and go like this - "Errrrrrrr."

16:14.520 --> 16:17.080
I felt that was inappropriate.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.080
Mr Baba did not physically touch me

16:19.080 --> 16:23.720
but he did once make a verbal
comment that I had very nice breasts

16:23.720 --> 16:28.600
and that he would like
to put his head between them
and go like this - "Bwwwwwwww."

16:28.600 --> 16:30.720
I felt this was inappropriate.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.800
Mr Baba did not physically touch me

16:32.800 --> 16:36.520
but he did once make a verbal comment
that I had very nice breasts

16:36.520 --> 16:39.960
and that he would like to put his
head between them and go like this...

16:40.960 --> 16:42.200
You get me?

16:42.200 --> 16:45.200
Omar badly needs a
public display of support,

16:45.200 --> 16:48.680
but will any of his staff
be prepared to come to his rescue?

16:48.680 --> 16:53.440
Well, I...I cannot have sexually
harassed EVERYBODY who works for me.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.040
Find me my ugliest staff member.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.800
FlyLo check-in, Keeley speakin'.

16:59.800 --> 17:04.920
With the question of who's
going to be the new
check-in manager all but settled,

17:04.920 --> 17:08.640
Keeley is suddenly called into
FlyLo's Head Office for a meeting.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.520
Keeley St Clair,
here to meet Omar Baba.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.840
- OK, take a seat.
- Thank you.

17:13.840 --> 17:17.960
Is it just possible that
this story has one final twist?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.760
Back down at the
Customer Service Desk...

17:21.760 --> 17:23.080
Quickly, Peter.

17:23.080 --> 17:26.720
..FlyLo's package holidays are
still proving unsatisfactory.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.600
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.080
The manager's not here.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.080
Well, then I would like to
speak to the assistant manager.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.180
- He's on lunch.

17:33.180 --> 17:35.360
Well then I'd like to speak to you.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.000
Go ahead.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
We have had, and it's not a
phrase I would often use,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.320
the holiday from hell!

17:41.320 --> 17:45.820
After last week's disaster, FlyLo
gave us two free tickets to Peru.

17:45.820 --> 17:47.760
So far, so good.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.000
We were flying over the Andes...

17:49.000 --> 17:51.800
I'm talking, you're talking.
We can't both be talking.

17:51.800 --> 17:52.100
Sorry, Judith.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.100
Apology accepted
on this occasion, Peter.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.720
Thank you, Judith.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.720
So, we were on the plane
flying over the Andes.

17:58.720 --> 18:02.920
Now, the first disappointment was
there was no fresh milk. It was UHT.

18:02.920 --> 18:06.120
And the second disappointment
was that the engines failed

18:06.120 --> 18:08.120
and the plane crashed
into a mountain.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.000
All the passengers huddled toge...

18:09.000 --> 18:11.800
All the passengers huddled together
on the ice.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.800
It was immediately apparent
that we were all very hungry.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.800
So I suggested that we eat Peter.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.300
- Not ALL of me.
- No, not all of you,

18:18.300 --> 18:19.360
that would be unkind.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.680
So I found a penknife
and hacked off Peter's leg.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.960
As you can see,
I now sport a prosthetic limb.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.960
Yes, stop feeling sorry
for yourself, Peter.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.160
Right. Sorry, Judith.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.040
So, I popped Peter's
leg on the barbeque

18:33.040 --> 18:37.000
and at the same time rustled up some
simple but always popular dishes.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.660
Coleslaw, a potato salad
and couscous,

18:39.660 --> 18:41.660
which I do with
roasted vegetables.

18:41.660 --> 18:42.700
It's one of Nigella's.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.840
Now, Peter's leg was almost done
when the rescue helicopter arrived.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.680
We'd only been
on the mountain for half an hour.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.080
Unfortunately...

18:49.080 --> 18:52.800
Unfortunately,
they couldn't save Peter's leg.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.000
It had been cooked right through

18:54.000 --> 18:57.080
and also had been dipped in
a garlic and herb marinade.

18:57.080 --> 19:01.640
If I had to sum up the holiday in
one word I would say "disappointing".

19:01.640 --> 19:06.040
And the real shame for me was that
the potato salad remained untouched.

19:06.040 --> 19:09.920
Moses, Great British Air's
executive passenger liaison officer,

19:09.920 --> 19:14.840
is meeting a VIP jetting in from
Los Angeles, the actress Anna Friel.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.600
I'm a big fan of Miss Friel,
she's so beautiful and talented.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.000
I loved her on stage in
Breakfast At Tiffany's.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.800
And she was wonderful
in that shampoo ad.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.880
And the thing about Miss Friel is -
she flies with us all the time -

19:26.880 --> 19:29.270
it doesn't matter where she's
come from or how long the flight,

19:29.280 --> 19:31.840
she always looks a million dollars.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.400
If you'll pardon the pun.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.600
Oh, here she is! Hello, Miss Friel.
Lovely to see you again.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.160
Hello.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.750
- Let me take those for you.
- Thank you.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.860
How was the flight, did you get
some rest?

19:40.860 --> 19:41.920
Yes, thanks.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.840
There's just one thing,
I did lose an item on board.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.240
- Oh, yes?
- Yeah, my, er, wig.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.140
Oh. I didn't know you wore a wig.

19:49.140 --> 19:51.440
Yes, have done for years.
I'm as bald as a coot.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.440
They've searched the plane?
It's not there?

19:53.440 --> 19:54.580
No, they've looked everywhere.
They couldn't find it.

19:54.580 --> 19:56.600
And you've looked in your bag,
it's not in there?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.200
Nope.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.500
I think you look very beautiful
without it, Miss Friel.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.920
Thank you,but I really
would like to find it.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.320
Yes, yes, of course. Well, obviously
this is quite a delicate matter

20:06.320 --> 20:08.520
so what I'm going to do is
slip you into our first class lounge,

20:08.520 --> 20:10.000
you'll have more privacy there.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.480
Thanks.

20:11.480 --> 20:15.160
Could we make room for Miss Anna
Friel, please?! She's lost her wig!

20:20.960 --> 20:23.520
Stop staring at Anna Friel.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.640
George is one of the airport's
longest-serving employees.

20:27.640 --> 20:31.920
'I've been cleaning the toilets in
the airport for a number of years now.'

20:31.920 --> 20:33.680
You get all sorts going on in here.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.880
To be honest, when someone comes in
and actually does a poo,
it's a blessed relief.

20:37.880 --> 20:41.840
'Cleaning toilets, it's not
my passion. No, my passion's opera.'

20:41.840 --> 20:44.280
'I love it.
And people loves to hear it.'

21:01.320 --> 21:04.400
'I say people loves to hear it...
I have had a lot of complaints.'

21:04.400 --> 21:07.680
But then, you see,
opera's not for everyone.

21:08.760 --> 21:13.000
It's 4:25, and Omar has called
a press conference at the airport,

21:13.000 --> 21:17.080
so he can publicly refute the
allegations of sexual harassment.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.760
Thank you all for coming here
and giving me chance

21:23.760 --> 21:28.320
to deny these disgusting allegations
of sexual harassment against me.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.000
And may I also say

21:30.000 --> 21:33.920
how wonderful it is to see so many
beautiful ladies in the room.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.560
Today, I will prove my innocence!

21:39.560 --> 21:42.500
This lady here is
an employee of FlyLo.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.320
- Hello.
- Please, do come.

21:46.440 --> 21:52.200
Tell me, have I ever touched you
in an inappropriate way?

21:52.200 --> 21:54.920
No, Omar, you have not.

21:54.920 --> 21:59.440
And have I ever made lewd comment,
like... Give me paper.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.680
.."What a beautiful
meaty bottom you have"?

22:03.680 --> 22:06.680
Or, "May I tweak your left nipple?"

22:06.680 --> 22:09.880
Or, "Please touch it,
I promise it won't take long"!

22:09.880 --> 22:12.600
No, Omar, also you have not.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.880
OK.

22:14.880 --> 22:20.880
So I ask you this, what do you think
of these...allegations against me?

22:20.880 --> 22:24.120
I think they are nonsense, Omar.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.960
Proof!

22:25.960 --> 22:31.120
And this from one of my most senior
employees. What is your job title?

22:31.120 --> 22:33.000
Well, I was check-in assistant

22:33.000 --> 22:35.680
but as of this afternoon
I am now check-in manager.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.200
The check-in manager
herself has said it.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.720
So, please, everybody,

22:40.720 --> 22:45.720
take picture of happy boss
and happy staff member. OK?

23:00.360 --> 23:02.600
It's half past five

23:02.600 --> 23:06.000
and, over in the Great British Air
first class lounge,

23:06.000 --> 23:10.440
Moses believes he may have found a
solution to Anna Friel's hairy situation.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.340
How are you settling in,
Miss Friel, all right?

23:12.340 --> 23:13.600
Yep.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.800
Have you been offered a small
glass of fresh orange juice

23:16.800 --> 23:18.440
and a complimentary
browse of the Daily Mail?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.480
- Yes, I have.
- Now, about the wig.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.400
- It's...good and bad news.
- Right.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.840
The bad news is,
they can't find your wig.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.640
- Really?
- They've looked everywhere.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.520
A thousand apologies.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.320
The good news is that lost
property do have a box of wigs

23:32.320 --> 23:34.160
that have been left
here over the years.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.760
No-one's claimed them and
you're welcome to have one.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.600
Well, I suppose
it's worth having a look.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.680
Okey-dokey. Lets have a rummage,
if you pardon the pun.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.480
Right, what have we got here?

23:44.480 --> 23:46.400
Oh, yes, how about this one?

23:49.800 --> 23:52.200
I'm known more as
a brunette really.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.760
You're absolutely right, Miss Friel.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.640
What else have we got? Oh, yes.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.640
How about this one?
You be the judge.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.240
"If you'll pardon the pun."
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.040
There's no pun there.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.020
Can I be frank, Miss Friel?

24:07.020 --> 24:09.880
- Of course.
- It ages you.

24:09.880 --> 24:13.480
Don't worry, we'll find something.

24:15.360 --> 24:19.260
Several hours have passed since the
photographers had their argument,

24:19.260 --> 24:21.840
but Buster is still at the airport.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.120
I've got nowhere else to go.

24:24.120 --> 24:27.440
I've spent nearly every day
for the past 25 years with him.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.360
This is my life,

24:31.360 --> 24:33.320
and my life is with Mickey.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.080
Mickey too is struggling
to cope on his own.

24:39.080 --> 24:42.160
Don't seem right somehow,
being here on my own.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.240
I miss him, course I do.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.280
Mickey's a part of me.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.680
He's the blood that
runs through my veins.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.720
I feel like I've lost a limb.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.000
It was never me, it was always we.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.100
He's my rock.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.320
He's my coat in the winter.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.920
He's the brown sauce on my sausage.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.760
He's the sweetener in my tea.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.640
He's a juicy ripe apple
on a summer's day.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.080
He's my father, he's my son.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.320
He's my brother,

25:09.320 --> 25:10.840
he's my sister.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.520
He's the reason
I get up in the morning.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.320
He's simply...Buster.

25:15.320 --> 25:18.160
If I had to sum him up in one word,
I'd say...

25:19.680 --> 25:21.840
..Mickey.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.120
Anyone sitting here?

25:29.120 --> 25:31.120
No.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.160
How's it going, then?

25:35.160 --> 25:37.040
Fine.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.600
Great. Never been better.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.440
I miss ya.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.200
I miss you too.

25:47.800 --> 25:52.200
Well...what say we go
and take some photographs

25:52.200 --> 25:54.840
of some celebrities
looking tired, then, eh?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.720
Yeah!

25:56.720 --> 25:59.000
Oh, no, you can't, can you,
because you're not allowed

25:59.000 --> 26:01.540
to take photos any more, are you?

26:01.600 --> 26:02.040
No. Mm.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.600
But I can come and watch!

26:05.600 --> 26:07.280
Yeah. Yeah.

26:14.800 --> 26:18.000
It's 7pm, and Melody is digesting

26:18.000 --> 26:21.520
the news of Keeley's
promotion to check-in manager.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.240
Oh, it's a great feeling,
I'm dead made up.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.480
I'm not surprised I got the job,

26:25.480 --> 26:28.480
but I'm just glad they
gave it to me on merit.

26:28.480 --> 26:29.880
Oh, so the fact that
you supported Omar

26:29.880 --> 26:32.960
in his sexual harassment case
had nothing to do with it?

26:32.960 --> 26:35.100
No. I think if anything
that counted against me.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.400
How do you work that out?

26:36.400 --> 26:38.400
All right, Melody, I think you need
to get back to your desk,

26:38.400 --> 26:41.720
there's some passengers
need checkin' in.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.960
Quickly!

26:46.960 --> 26:48.880
She can be very lax.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.480
Less of the attitude, please.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.520
It's the end of another
hard day's work,

26:57.520 --> 26:59.720
but everyone will be back tomorrow.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.800
The battle re-enactors realised

27:02.800 --> 27:07.720
the utter futility of what they were
doing, and immediately stopped.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.520
Bobo had a rather
unproductive shift.

27:10.520 --> 27:14.600
All he sniffed out was a Jaffa Cake
and a copy of Jilly Cooper's Polo.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.120
And Moses saved the day
for Anna Friel.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.600
Miss Friel,
you've never looked lovelier.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.440
- All right, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.880
Thank you.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.200
Every inch a star.
