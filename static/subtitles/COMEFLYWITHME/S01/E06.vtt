00:02.000 --> 00:06.240
This is our final
look at life in one of
Britain's busiest airports.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.640
On today's show, Taaj has to
deal with some angry passengers.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.160
I've only got two sets of ears,
isn't it?

00:12.160 --> 00:13.840
Penny has to work in Economy.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.320
OK, scum, duty-free time!
Who wants booze and fags?

00:17.320 --> 00:21.120
And Fearghal consoles a passenger
with a birthday.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.240
39. Oof! That is old.

00:23.240 --> 00:27.200
I couldn't imagine being 39.
It's like 102 in gay years.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.640
It's 6am.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.560
Thank you, Mr Levatu.
Enjoy your flight.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.600
And today is Keeley's first day
as FlyLo Check-in Manager.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.760
I need to buy a ticket
to Guernsey, please.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.360
- For today, sir?
- 15.05?

01:11.360 --> 01:12.880
Certainly, sir.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.720
That will be £283.67 exactly.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.400
If you'd like to put your credit
card in the slot.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.640
Just put in your PIN number
and there is your boarding pass.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.600
- Thank you.
- For your information,

01:24.600 --> 01:28.320
all FlyLo flights to Guernsey have
been suspended today
due to industrial action.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.640
Next, please.

01:29.640 --> 01:34.960
Despite now being in charge,
Keeley is having to man the desks
on her own,

01:34.960 --> 01:37.200
as all of her staff have walked out
on strike.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.520
A strike?!

01:38.520 --> 01:41.080
And word soon reaches Head Office.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.680
Well, what is the matter
with these people?

01:43.680 --> 01:45.400
I already pay them £2 an hour!

01:45.400 --> 01:49.960
Taaj has the unenviable task
of having to tell disgruntled
passengers

01:49.960 --> 01:53.240
that no FlyLo planes
are taking off today.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.360
Everybody, quiet down! I've only
got two sets of ears, isn't it?

01:56.360 --> 01:58.720
What's happening
with the flight to Marbella?

01:58.720 --> 02:00.680
- It's cancelled.
- And what about Lanzarote?

02:00.680 --> 02:02.840
- Cancelled.
- What about the flight to Majorca?

02:02.840 --> 02:05.360
Cancelled. Because of the strike,
all the flights is cancelled.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.400
I'm here with my wife and kids.
This is our holiday.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.680
Thanks to you lot going on strike,
you've ruined our holiday.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.120
- No, boss, you ruined your holiday.
- How do you work that one out?

02:15.120 --> 02:18.320
Because you was a cheapskate and you
booked with a crap airline, isn't it?

02:18.320 --> 02:19.640
No!

02:19.640 --> 02:23.440
I'm 100% behind this strike.
They needs to pay us more money

02:23.440 --> 02:27.240
because I'm still living at home with
my parents, but I've got to move out

02:27.240 --> 02:30.240
because, like, last night,
I was watching Transformers

02:30.240 --> 02:34.320
and I had it paused on the bit
where Megan Fox is
leaning over the car bonnet,

02:34.320 --> 02:37.040
and my mum walked in and she saw it
and it was fully erect.

02:37.040 --> 02:40.400
Although the strike has grounded
all FlyLo planes,

02:40.400 --> 02:43.400
other airlines are operating
as normal.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.160
On this Great British Air flight
to Florida,

02:46.160 --> 02:49.240
Economy is packed,
but First Class is deserted.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.480
Well, it was going to be
a quiet day anyway.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.800
We only had two passengers
booked into First Class

02:53.800 --> 02:58.880
and the passengers in question
have just cancelled,
which is a dreadful shame.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.680
- Hi, Penny. Did you get the message?
- Yeah, such a pity they cancelled.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.560
No, the message about
helping us out in Economy?

03:08.560 --> 03:10.680
Piss off!

03:10.680 --> 03:15.000
Penny hasn't had to work
in Economy for 20 years.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.120
But today, she has no choice.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.880
Ugh!

03:19.880 --> 03:23.000
PENNY: When you draw back
the curtain, the first thing
that really hits you

03:23.000 --> 03:27.280
is the stench, and it's the stench
of the working man.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.760
I mean, they're virtually like apes,
you know.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.800
So if you come at them
with some food...

03:31.800 --> 03:32.840
Arrrgh, arrrgh!

03:32.840 --> 03:34.400
..they start attacking you.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.000
Hot towel? Hot towel?

03:38.720 --> 03:40.160
- Hot towel?
- I'm all right, thanks.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.440
- No, you should take a hot towel.
- I don't want it.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.280
- No, you need to take it.
- I told you, no.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.160
Right...here.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.280
Urgh!

03:51.760 --> 03:53.160
Hot towel?

03:53.160 --> 03:55.720
It's 10am, and back down on the
ground,

03:55.720 --> 03:59.560
the airport's flying school
has a very nervous visitor.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.400
Would you like to come in now,
please?

04:01.400 --> 04:05.400
Happy Burger employee Tommy
is determined to follow his dream

04:05.400 --> 04:07.520
- of becoming a pilot.
- Take a seat.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.800
And today, he has a make-or-break
interview at the flying school.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.040
Right...name?

04:14.040 --> 04:17.120
- Tommy.
- Tommy what?

04:17.120 --> 04:18.720
Tommy Reid.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.880
Age?

04:19.880 --> 04:21.960
20...

04:21.960 --> 04:23.400
- 20.
- ..two.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.880
22?

04:24.880 --> 04:27.160
Aye.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.320
Current occupation?

04:28.320 --> 04:30.320
Burgers.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.560
And what is your main
responsibility?

04:33.560 --> 04:35.200
Oh, buns.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.560
Qualifications?
Do you have any GCSEs?

04:41.560 --> 04:44.800
Well, you see, we don't have GCSEs
in Scotland. We just have Standards.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.720
Oh, I'm sorry,
do you have any Standards?

04:46.720 --> 04:47.800
No.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.840
Do you have any hobbies or
interests?

04:52.840 --> 04:55.280
- No.
- Come on...

04:55.280 --> 04:57.120
you must be able to think of
something.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.880
Oh...

04:58.880 --> 04:59.920
No.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.960
Finally, do you have
any medical conditions

05:04.960 --> 05:07.280
that would prevent you
from becoming a pilot?

05:07.280 --> 05:09.480
Fear of flying.

05:12.760 --> 05:13.880
I think it went really well.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.920
In fact, I dinnae think
it could have gone much better.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.360
I wouldnae be surprised
if they let me fly a plane tomorrow.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.680
- Oh, did I get it?
- I'm sorry?

05:21.680 --> 05:24.120
- Did I get it?
- We'll write to you.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.960
Oh, no, don't do that.
I cannae read.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.320
Think I got it.

05:32.480 --> 05:36.840
Meanwhile, Chief Immigration Officer
Ian Foot is starting his shift.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.360
There are increasing

05:38.360 --> 05:42.280
numbers of people who want
to come and live in this country,

05:42.280 --> 05:44.680
and that's because, let's be frank,

05:44.680 --> 05:47.360
it is the greatest country in the
world.

05:47.360 --> 05:51.920
So to stem the tide of immigrants,
I stop anyone with
a foreign-sounding name.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.120
Like Wong or Patel...

05:55.120 --> 05:56.720
or Murphy.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.840
Today, Ian is interrogating
a Polish man

05:59.840 --> 06:02.760
who has just arrived
on a flight from Warsaw.

06:02.760 --> 06:06.360
Right, now the problem you have,
Mr...

06:06.360 --> 06:11.080
Dubrovsky, is I believe it is your
plan to work here illegally.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.000
- That is ridiculous.
- Well, you say that, Mr...

06:15.000 --> 06:16.840
Dubrovsky.

06:16.840 --> 06:20.560
But there are increasing numbers of
people in this country from Poland -

06:20.560 --> 06:23.360
Poles, Polacks, benefit cheats,
call them what you will,

06:23.360 --> 06:26.640
who come over here, take our jobs
and eat our cabbage.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.160
- That is very offensive.
- I tell you what is offensive, Mr...

06:30.160 --> 06:33.800
Dubrovsky, is the floodgates being
open to people like you.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.640
How do I know your plan is not
to work here illegally as a plumber

06:37.640 --> 06:40.120
or a cleaner or a builder
or a lap dancer?

06:40.120 --> 06:41.840
Because I already have a job here.

06:41.840 --> 06:45.040
During the day, maybe, Mr...

06:46.040 --> 06:47.320
..Dubrovsky.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.720
But how do I know, in the evenings,

06:48.720 --> 06:51.400
you're not going to be shaking
your booty at Spearmint Rhino?

06:51.400 --> 06:54.680
Because I am the Polish Ambassador
to the United Kingdom.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.920
What I'm going to do is I'm going
to let you in this time

07:03.920 --> 07:05.480
and I wish you a pleasant stay.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.520
The way you've spoken about
my countrymen is disgusting.

07:10.520 --> 07:14.200
I'm going to make a formal complaint
about you. What is your name?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.840
Sheila Bennett.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.360
I want to know the name of this
gentleman who has
just interviewed me.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.920
His attitude was
absolutely outrageous.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.800
Many people who pass through
the airport require extra attention.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.280
And they are the responsibility
of Corinne.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.880
My job is to greet people
coming off the aircraft

07:37.880 --> 07:41.160
who have special needs.
For example, today,

07:41.160 --> 07:44.560
I'm meeting an elderly gentleman
who's flying in from Saudi Arabia

07:44.560 --> 07:48.760
who has mobility issues,
and I'll be there to guide him
through the airport,

07:48.760 --> 07:53.160
passport control,
baggage reclaim and into his taxi
as smoothly as possible.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.720
Corinne has worked at the airport
for five years.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.560
When I originally applied for this
post, I was turned down.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.040
But it went to an industrial
tribunal and I was given the job.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.640
But the airline now does have to
employ someone to wheel me,

08:09.640 --> 08:11.280
and that person is Bob.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.560
I am Bob.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.320
Some people have suggested
that I shouldn't have this job.

08:18.320 --> 08:22.400
But I say that those people are
just being racist against disableds.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.400
I'm actually glad to be taking part
in this documentary

08:25.400 --> 08:29.280
because if you think about it, how
many disabled people are there on TV?

08:29.280 --> 08:33.000
David Blunkett, Stephen Hawking,
Piers Morgan.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Our Lady Air cabin crew member
Fearghal
is desperate

08:36.000 --> 08:38.760
to win the Steward of the Year
Competition.

08:38.760 --> 08:42.840
But on today's flight to Barcelona,
he's being less than attentive,

08:42.840 --> 08:45.520
as he's waiting for the nominations
to be announced.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.080
Well, you're not supposed to have
your phone on during the flight.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.680
It can interfere with
the aircraft's navigation system

08:50.680 --> 08:52.360
and could cause the plane to crash,

08:52.360 --> 08:54.040
but this is obviously
a very important call.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.760
TANNOY: Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for flying Our Lady Air.

08:57.760 --> 09:01.280
We're about to begin our descent
so please fasten your seatbelts

09:01.280 --> 09:02.800
and say three Hail Marys.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.480
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

09:05.480 --> 09:08.200
We've only been
in the air 40 minutes.
We can't be landing in Barcelona yet.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.480
No, we are.
We're landing at Shannon, Barcelona.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.920
- Shannon, Barcelona?
- That's right.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.040
But Shannon's in Ireland.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.680
Yes, madam. In order
to keep our fare prices competitive
we do sometimes land

09:18.680 --> 09:21.320
at airports a little further away
from the city centre.

09:21.320 --> 09:24.600
But we're landing in Ireland.
That's nowhere near Barcelona.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.920
Oh, no, don't worry. A short coach
transfer to your final destination

09:27.920 --> 09:29.840
is included in the price
of your ticket.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.920
Shannon to Rosslare, catch the ferry,
down at Dover,

09:32.920 --> 09:36.920
over to Calais,
through France, across the Pyrenees
and into Barcelona

09:36.920 --> 09:39.120
- in time for your evening meal.
- Which evening?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.000
- Tuesday.
- That's absolutely...

09:41.000 --> 09:44.080
- Excuse me, can you watch
your language, please, madam?
- I'm just...

09:44.080 --> 09:46.160
I don't want to have
to use the restraints.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.120
PHONE RINGS
Cor!

09:49.120 --> 09:51.400
Hello? Hello?

09:51.400 --> 09:53.160
Hel...?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.520
Can you turn the thrusters down?
I can hardly hear!

09:58.520 --> 09:59.800
Thank you.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.920
Yes?

10:01.920 --> 10:05.080
Really? Well, that's fantastic news,
thank you so much!

10:05.080 --> 10:06.880
I'll see you there!

10:06.880 --> 10:08.040
Yes!

10:08.040 --> 10:09.160
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

10:09.160 --> 10:12.920
You're not allowed to use mobile
phones on an aeroplane.
I could report you for that.

10:12.920 --> 10:17.440
Oh, really? Well, I've just been
nominated for Steward Of The Year,

10:17.440 --> 10:19.960
so shove that up your fat arse.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.520
Shepherd's pie or mushroom risotto?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.960
It's two hours into the flight
to Florida,

10:25.960 --> 10:30.440
and Penny is struggling to come
to terms with her new environment.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.960
Urgh, don't touch me!

10:32.960 --> 10:34.960
The noise, the people.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.720
There's only one word
to describe them. Savages.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.840
And I just poked my head
in the lavatorium.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.880
It's positively medieval in there.

10:42.880 --> 10:47.800
Ladies and...
People of cattle class,
may I have your attention, please?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.440
I have just returned from
an inspection

10:50.440 --> 10:55.320
of the on-board convenience,
and one of you has left it
in a revolting state.

10:55.320 --> 10:59.400
Who didn't flush?
Come on. Who didn't flush?

10:59.400 --> 11:02.400
It was someone who had
the mushroom risotto.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.440
Hands up if you had
the mushroom risotto.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.880
PENNY: This whole frightful situation

11:06.880 --> 11:10.880
would never occur in First Class.
People in First Class
don't forget to flush.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.480
They're very diligent flushers.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.320
And if they do, it doesn't matter

11:14.320 --> 11:18.120
because their stools
are perfectly formed and odour-free.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.600
NARRATOR: It's midday, and back
in the terminal the FlyLo strike

11:21.600 --> 11:25.440
is causing knock-on problems
for coffee-kiosk employee Precious,

11:25.440 --> 11:27.160
who's having to close early.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.800
PRECIOUS: We got the coffee,

11:28.800 --> 11:32.160
we got the milk, we got the water,
we got the fire, we got the sugar

11:32.160 --> 11:34.240
and we got the sweetener
for our fat friend

11:34.240 --> 11:36.160
who is afflicted with the diabesity.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.600
Praise be to Jesus,
he died for our sins!

11:39.600 --> 11:42.600
But today, we got no customer.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.320
All them FlyLo staff is on strike.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.520
Them folk just lazy, lazy, lazy.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.800
They doesn't know what hard work is.

11:50.800 --> 11:55.120
I've been working at this kiosk,
day in, day out, for 20 year now,

11:55.120 --> 11:59.080
and in that time,
I sold over 100 cup of coffee.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.200
But today, this airport just empty

12:02.200 --> 12:06.720
so me got no option but to
close early, which as you know,
me hates to do.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.920
Well, you know what they say.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.120
Them low-cost airlines
is the work of the Devil.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.280
Corinthians, chapter 2,
verses 10 to 11.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.200
Closed!

12:19.720 --> 12:23.600
NARRATOR: Over in Departures,
Moses is collecting for charity.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.880
MOSES: As you may know, I do

12:25.880 --> 12:28.920
a lot of work behind the scenes
for my charity, WishWings,

12:28.920 --> 12:30.720
if you'll pardon the pun.

12:30.720 --> 12:34.960
Basically, it's free flights
for very ill children.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.000
We take sick kids and we give them
a break from being ill.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.920
Well, I mean, they're still ill
but they're on a plane.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.920
And I'm very excited
because I'm actually releasing

12:43.920 --> 12:47.880
a charity single, which I'm hoping
will be Christmas number one.

12:47.880 --> 12:52.000
It's a cover of the West Life
classic, Flying Without Wings.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.680
And I've posted the video
on YouTube.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.200
So I'll just show you that.

12:57.200 --> 13:01.800
(TUNELESSLY)
# Everybody's looking for that
something

13:03.360 --> 13:08.160
# One thing that makes it all
complete

13:10.080 --> 13:14.440
# You'll find it
in the strangest places

13:17.160 --> 13:21.080
# Places you never knew
it could be... #

13:21.080 --> 13:25.000
I played all the instruments myself.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.360
I don't like to blow my own trumpet
but I did actually
blow my own trumpet!

13:29.360 --> 13:33.880
# ..And it's like flying
without wings

13:33.880 --> 13:36.720
# Cos you're my special thing

13:36.720 --> 13:41.560
# I'm flying without wings... #

13:41.560 --> 13:43.640
I love you, Moses.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.800
I love you, child.

13:45.800 --> 13:50.640
# I'm flying without wings. #

13:55.000 --> 13:57.840
As you can see,
it's already had seven hits

13:57.840 --> 14:00.880
so it's something
of an internet phenomenon.

14:00.880 --> 14:05.040
Do I hope it brings my music
to a wider audience? Yes.

14:05.040 --> 14:09.120
Do I also hope it raises some money
for sick children? Yeah.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.560
That would be a bonus.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.600
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
in Baggage Handling...

14:15.240 --> 14:17.760
..the strike is having
an unexpected effect.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.200
JOHN: I'm all for going

14:19.200 --> 14:22.480
- on strike, me.
- We don't work for FlyLo, Dad.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.640
Yeah, but it's solidarity, though,
innit, boy? With my FlyLo brothers.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.840
What about all those cases
from Lufthansa?

14:28.840 --> 14:31.200
Nah! Point of principle.
Won't touch 'em.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.280
Right, I'm off.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.560
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home, boy!

14:36.560 --> 14:38.880
Well, when you get home,
can you do your washing-up?

14:38.880 --> 14:41.560
Nah, mate. I'm on strike, aren't I?

14:45.560 --> 14:49.560
It's lunchtime and the busy period
for the airport pub,

14:49.560 --> 14:52.880
- run by Ray and Anne Wilkins.
- Me and the wife

14:52.880 --> 14:57.720
used to run a lovely little
country pub in Wiltshire,
called The Yeoman's Rest.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.760
- A lovely pub, wasn't it, Ray?
- Yeah.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.880
We used to live above it.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.720
I'd do ploughman's during the week
and then roast of a Sunday.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.840
Beef, lamb or pork.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.760
It's very different now.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.720
Now, to get to work, we have to
park the car three mile away
and get on a monorail.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.760
- Lamb was the most popular.
- Yeah.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.640
My dream is to turn this place
into more of a local.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.880
Hello, there! Usual, is it?

15:20.880 --> 15:22.520
I've never been here before.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.480
I'm hoping people
will love the atmosphere so much,

15:25.480 --> 15:28.520
they'll think, "Bugger the flight,
I'm staying here."

15:28.520 --> 15:30.880
You've tried everything, though,
ain't you, Ray?

15:30.880 --> 15:34.920
Karaoke, stand-up comedy,
Friday-night disco,

15:34.920 --> 15:36.480
badger-baiting.

15:36.480 --> 15:40.720
RAY: The trouble is,
the longest anyone has ever
stayed here is 12 minutes.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.240
- NARRATOR: Over at Happy Burger...
- TOMMY: I've got it!

15:48.240 --> 15:51.280
..Tommy's received a letter
from the flying school.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.920
"Dear Tommy,

15:52.920 --> 15:54.920
"thank you for your application.

15:54.920 --> 15:59.600
"Unfortunately, you do not have
the required...qualif...

15:59.600 --> 16:02.040
"qauli...quali..."

16:02.040 --> 16:04.880
- Qualifications.
- "..qualitifications.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.560
"We wish you luck in the future."

16:10.320 --> 16:12.960
Sorry about that, Tommy.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.360
Bad luck, Tommy.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.680
TOMMY: That's it.
Never going to be a pilot.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.320
So I'm going to hand in my notice

16:20.320 --> 16:23.760
cos the only reason I was working
here was to help me become a pilot.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.520
I actually live 400 miles away.

16:25.520 --> 16:28.080
I have to get seven buses in
every morning.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.920
Some days the traffic's so bad that
I just have to stay here overnight

16:31.920 --> 16:33.920
and sleep on a bed of nuggets

16:33.920 --> 16:36.800
and use, like, a bun as a pillow.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.440
Back at the WishWings stall,
there's an emergency.

16:40.440 --> 16:44.040
Moses has collapsed and the airport's
paramedics waste no time

16:44.040 --> 16:47.320
in calling an ambulance.

16:47.320 --> 16:50.160
The children! The children!
How are the children?!

16:50.160 --> 16:52.280
- Stay nice and relaxed.
- I must help the children!

16:52.280 --> 16:56.920
As his colleagues fear the worst,
Moses is rushed to hospital.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.760
(BLEEPING)

17:01.080 --> 17:03.440
I don't think I'm going to make it.

17:03.440 --> 17:08.360
All I care about is that my charity,
WishWings, lives on.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.880
If you'll pardon the pun.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.440
And can you ask Elton John
to sing at my funeral?

17:15.960 --> 17:19.680
Or, if he's not available,
Leona Lewis.

17:23.040 --> 17:28.080
Over at Special Services, Corinne's
helper Bob has hurt his back.

17:29.680 --> 17:36.040
With the FlyLo strike in full flow,
no-one is manning the sales desk.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.680
Typical.

17:37.680 --> 17:41.200
My first complaint is that there's
no-one to complain to,

17:41.200 --> 17:44.440
which, in itself,
is a pretty serious complaint.

17:44.440 --> 17:48.320
Secondly, we have had - and I'm
not going to beat about the bush -

17:48.320 --> 17:50.240
the holiday from hell.

17:50.240 --> 17:54.160
After last week's catastrophe,
FlyLo recommended

17:54.160 --> 17:57.720
that we go to the little-known
African island of Tubutu.

17:57.720 --> 18:01.280
It wasn't long before the dark art
of voodoo raised its ugly head.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.800
Yes, thank you, Peter.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.000
We landed at the airport
and, within seconds,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.520
we were kidnapped by a voodoo tribe.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.120
I thought, "We didn't sign up
for this excursion

18:10.120 --> 18:12.240
"but, hey-ho,
let's keep an open mind."

18:12.240 --> 18:13.800
We were taken to the jungle...

18:13.800 --> 18:15.640
All in good time, Peter.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.960
We were taken to the jungle
and tied to a tree.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.360
In the process,
they ripped my cagoule.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.880
Night fell and the high priestess
put a curse on Peter.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.800
She then produced a voodoo doll
and manipulated Peter

18:27.800 --> 18:31.160
into impregnating
all the young females of the tribe.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.520
There were 17 in total, virgins.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.160
There were 17 in total,
all of them apparently virgins.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.240
It was abhorrent for me to watch

18:39.240 --> 18:42.680
and, if I know Peter, he would've
found it deeply degrading.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.200
I was banging away till dawn.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.320
- Peter, don't be so crude!
- Sorry, Judith.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.600
He was rutting away till dawn.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.960
Fortunately, after eight
or nine hours, Peter was spent

18:51.960 --> 18:55.600
and the high priestess very kindly
gave us a lift back to the airport.

18:55.600 --> 19:00.560
I must say, for as long as I live,
I would never go back there.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.760
I would.

19:03.040 --> 19:07.840
It's 5pm and Ian Foot
is clearing out his office.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.920
After a formal complaint
by the Polish Ambassador,

19:10.920 --> 19:13.880
he has been suspended on full pay.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.880
I've come to expect this sort of
thing. I was suspended
a couple of years back.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.640
A gentleman in a wheelchair
came through border control.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.560
He had a British passport
but an American accent.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.000
So I asked him to step aside...
Well, wheel aside.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.360
Turned out it was
Professor Stephen Hawking.

19:29.360 --> 19:34.240
But you can't make an omelette
without breaking some eggs.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.120
Or indeed adding
butter and seasoning.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.320
I bounced back from that
and I'll bounce back from this.

19:40.320 --> 19:46.480
What I'll probably do now
is go home, open a tin of soup,
see what's on TV,

19:46.480 --> 19:50.920
and if I'm still feeling down this
afternoon, I'll call a prostitute.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.840
Not a Polish one.
A British one, obviously.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.480
Also heading home is Tommy,

19:57.480 --> 20:00.800
who has just finished his final shift
at Happy Burger

20:00.800 --> 20:03.760
and is bidding
a fond farewell to the airport.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.760
Why haven't you got
any clothes on, Tommy?

20:05.760 --> 20:08.240
Eh? I had to give the uniform back.

20:08.240 --> 20:13.360
Thing is, my foster mother
always told me that if I didnae
make it as a pilot,

20:13.360 --> 20:16.000
it was important to have
something to fall back on.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.760
So I'm going to apply
to become a spaceman.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.040
Thank you very much, sir.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.360
It's been three hours since Moses
was rushed to hospital.

20:34.360 --> 20:38.520
But to everyone's surprise,
he's back at his stall.

20:38.520 --> 20:42.520
What happened was I blew
too hard on a balloon, and I fainted.

20:42.520 --> 20:46.200
I think it's ironic that this
happened while I was helping others.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.640
Maybe sometimes I give too much.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.800
Anyway, at the hospital,
I had a lot of test and scans,

20:51.800 --> 20:55.800
and the doctor said that from now on,
I'm going to have to
use one of these.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.960
And even that's quite strenuous.

21:03.560 --> 21:07.880
It's seven o'clock,
and with the strike now
crippling all FlyLo services,

21:07.880 --> 21:12.160
Omar Baba decides to tackle
the ringleaders face to face.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.760
Boy! Come!

21:15.920 --> 21:19.400
Because FlyLo doesn't pay us enough,
isn't it? Yeah, yeah?

21:19.400 --> 21:23.440
Because we is working too many hours,
isn't it? Yeah, yeah?

21:23.440 --> 21:25.440
We need to confront this Omar Baba

21:25.440 --> 21:29.240
and we need to tell him that we
is not going to take it any more.
You get me?

21:29.240 --> 21:31.880
- Yeah? You get me?
- (SHOUTS OF AGREEMENT)

21:31.880 --> 21:35.840
Yeah? You get me? Yeah? You get me?
Oh...um...oh...

21:35.840 --> 21:40.400
- Hello, Mr Baba.
- Please...carry on.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.120
Hmm?

21:42.120 --> 21:46.360
Oh, no, I wasn't doing anything.
I was just listening to,
um, some other people.

21:46.360 --> 21:50.640
In fact...in fact, it was her.
She's actually quite a shit-stirrer.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.160
Please...be seated.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.160
I am a humble man.

22:01.600 --> 22:05.080
When I started this airline,
all I had was a dream...

22:05.080 --> 22:09.200
and £3.2 billion my father gave me.

22:09.200 --> 22:13.240
And now FlyLo
is the UK's seventh favourite...

22:13.240 --> 22:15.040
Eighth!

22:15.040 --> 22:18.800
..eighth favourite low-cost airline.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.120
To me, FlyLo is a family,

22:23.120 --> 22:25.920
and you are my children.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.920
I know you all by name...

22:29.200 --> 22:30.720
Pet-e.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.960
Jane-et.

22:32.960 --> 22:37.520
And, ah, my oldest friend, Trainee.
(CHUCKLES)

22:37.520 --> 22:41.840
How many times have we laughed
together about the low-cost airline
business, huh?

22:41.840 --> 22:43.320
(CHUCKLES)

22:43.320 --> 22:44.480
Ew.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.040
We are family.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.800
We must pull together.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.680
What is 18-hour shift between
family, huh?

22:51.680 --> 22:52.800
(MURMURING)

22:52.800 --> 22:56.080
What is inadequate toilet facilities
between family?

22:56.080 --> 22:57.360
ALL: Yeah!

22:57.360 --> 23:00.800
What is highly flammable uniforms
between family?

23:00.800 --> 23:04.560
- ALL: Yeah!
- Come on, be a family...

23:04.560 --> 23:06.520
and go back to work.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.800
OK!

23:12.800 --> 23:15.520
First thing tomorrow,
have them all fired.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.680
Yes, sir.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.120
The big night has arrived,

23:19.120 --> 23:22.840
and Fearghal is about to
find out if he's been named
Steward of the Year.

23:22.840 --> 23:26.400
- Good luck, Fearghal.
- Thank you.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.200
So, I get a call from my agent,
who said,

23:28.200 --> 23:30.480
"Dale, would you present
the Steward of the Year awards?"

23:30.480 --> 23:34.080
And I thought,
"A room full of trolley dollies?

23:34.080 --> 23:36.760
"Too camp for me. No, thank you!"

23:36.760 --> 23:40.000
- (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
- That's good, a good gay joke.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.640
Now, I know you have all
been going wild in the aisles

23:42.640 --> 23:44.160
just to get your hands on this...

23:44.160 --> 23:46.840

24:00.960 --> 24:02.600

24:02.600 --> 24:06.040
I haven't been this excited since
Boots did a two-for-one on Fake Bake.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.360
(LAUGHTER)

24:08.360 --> 24:10.080

24:17.840 --> 24:22.160

that this year it will be shared,

so Fearghal and Mary,
come and join me!

24:25.800 --> 24:27.840
Well done. Congratulations.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.800
Oh, my God!
Thank you so much for this award.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.960
You know what, I think it's great
that it's being shared,

24:33.960 --> 24:36.720
because being cabin crew
is all about teamwork.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.840
I just want to say thank you, guys,
and I share this with you.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.360
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

24:46.200 --> 24:47.920
Bullshit.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.320
(MURMURING)

24:49.320 --> 24:52.200
There's no way
I'm sharing this award with her.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.680
I scored 100% in those
customer satisfaction forms.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.160
I know,
because I filled in every one myself.

24:58.160 --> 25:02.200
I force-fed nuts to a man with a nut
allergy and then saved his life,

25:02.200 --> 25:05.080
and I slept with the chairman
of Our Lady Air.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.040
I'm having this.
Thank you and good night.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.400
What's got into her(?)

25:09.400 --> 25:12.080
- Gay orange turd.

I used to really respect you till you
did those adverts for Cash My Gold.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.960
Dale Winton,
you've destroyed your legacy!

25:24.960 --> 25:27.920
And, of course,
it was amazing to win the award.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.440
It's just a shame
I ended up getting fired,

25:30.440 --> 25:34.200
