00:02.200 --> 00:05.680
This series looks at life in one
of Britain's busiest airports.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.720
On today's show...

00:06.720 --> 00:07.760
Ian Foot.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.480
Immigration gets a call.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.480
Well, how brown? I'm on my way.

00:11.480 --> 00:15.320
Fearghal goes all out to
impress his passengers.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.040
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

00:17.040 --> 00:18.880
I actually ordered
a vegetarian meal.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.760
Oh, sorry about that. Right. Er...

00:23.840 --> 00:26.400
And there's something in
the air for Simon and Jackie.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.960
Smells disgusting in here.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.560
It's probably just
the air circulation.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.560
No, it smells like one of yours.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.440
Next please.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.083
It's 9am and at the
FlyLo check-in desk

01:10.083 --> 01:12.834
Melody is faced with a weighty problem.

01:12.869 --> 01:14.680
Are you travelling on your own? Yes.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.200
Sorry, I had to ask, but
I can't see round you.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.440
Excuse me, Melody. Sorry, sir, can
I just have a very discreet word?

01:20.440 --> 01:23.240
- What's it about?
- Big fat man there. Yes.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.800
Because of the gentleman's size he
will need to purchase another seat.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.480
I've just been speaking to
my colleague, and I'm going

01:30.480 --> 01:33.960
to have to politely request that
you purchase a second seat, sir.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.302
Because you're so fat.

01:35.302 --> 01:37.963
- There's not much I can do
about this, is there? - No sir.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.800
- Boarding in half an hour.
- Thank you.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.280
What seats did you give him?

01:47.280 --> 01:53.080
- 9B and 37D.
- It's got to be two seats together.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.360
Well, you never said that.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.440
Next please.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.800
- We get this most days now.
- Yeah.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.080
There's a great big
fat person standing there

02:01.080 --> 02:02.720
and we have to tell them because
they're so big

02:02.720 --> 02:04.320
they've got to buy another ticket.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.040
- It's one of the perks of the job.
- Yeah.

02:06.040 --> 02:10.400
FlyLo currently have
the worse environmental
record of any UK airline.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.880
But owner Omar has a plan
to rectify the situation.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.280
Today I will make aviation history.

02:18.280 --> 02:22.680
I will announce that FlyLo
is first airline to go green.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.520
Good morning, good morning.

02:24.520 --> 02:28.160
Good morning to you ladies
and gentleman of the press.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.440
Today I bring you here, to this
beautiful park

02:31.440 --> 02:34.880
to show you FlyLo's
commitment to the environment.

02:34.880 --> 02:40.880
This morning I see catalogue of lies
about my airline on programme called

02:40.880 --> 02:45.120
Daybreak. They say FlyLo is
polluting the environment.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.690
Christine Bleakley you are not as
attractive as you think

02:48.690 --> 02:52.081
and your teeth are
too big for your mouth.

02:51.080 --> 02:56.520
And Adrian Chiles, you look like
potato! Not nice potato, ugly potato.

02:58.800 --> 03:05.760
So today I am planting tree to
show FlyLo's commitment to the
environment.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.200
Please do come.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.440
Get good photo, please.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.840
How many trees are you
going to plant, Mr Baba?

03:13.840 --> 03:20.280
Just this one. I now declare
that FlyLo is carbon-neutral!

03:20.280 --> 03:22.360
Yes!

03:22.360 --> 03:27.800
'I have many other plans for
my airline to help save environment.'

03:27.800 --> 03:32.680
I am going to make the
skirts of stewardesses 30%
shorter, use less fabric.

03:32.680 --> 03:37.120
From next week I am phasing
out toilet paper in all of my

03:37.120 --> 03:40.360
planes and as of today I have
stopped using deodorant.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.760
Musky.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.760
Fearghal works for Irish
airline Our Lady Air.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.770
The company runs a Steward Of The
Year competition,

03:51.770 --> 03:54.282
and this year
Fearghal is desperate to win.

03:54.840 --> 03:59.040
One of things you get marked
on for Steward Of The Year is
how much duty free you sell.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.840
Our best selling items are
perfumes and actually a lot

04:01.840 --> 04:04.400
of celebrities have started
bring out their own scents.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.840
We've got Pam St Clement from
EastEnders has brought out
"Pat Smell".

04:07.840 --> 04:11.440
Sarah Ferguson. "Embarrassment",
obviously.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.880
And for the men there's Ashley Cole,
"Love Rat",

04:14.880 --> 04:18.840
Gavin Henson, "Greasy Face"
and, er, this is a new one.

04:18.840 --> 04:22.800
Mel Gibson, "The Jews Are Responsible
For All The Wars In The World".

04:22.800 --> 04:25.040
Doesn't really sell so well,
that one.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.440
But no matter how much perfume

04:27.440 --> 04:32.560
he sells, Fearghal won't win
Steward of the Year without
excellent customer feedback.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.200
Yes. Excuse me, I need a word.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.360
I bought a business class
ticket for this flight. Yes, sir?

04:42.800 --> 04:45.520
I'm terribly sorry, sir, I forgot
to give you this.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.360
There we are, sir. Welcome to
business class.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.080
We have these passenger
questionnaires on all our
flights now. It's to help

05:00.080 --> 05:05.120
the airline decide who should be
Steward Of The Year, but I don't want
to bother my passengers with that.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.440
I just want them to relax and enjoy
the flight so I fill them in myself.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.680
And so far I've had a 100% approval
rating, which is pretty amazing.
Right...

05:13.560 --> 05:16.920
I'm sorry, but you can't
travel today because your
passport is out of date.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.720
Back down at Great British Air
check-in this passenger
has a problem.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.080
But no-one can speak Chinese.

05:23.080 --> 05:29.440
Fortunately, Executive
Passenger Liaison Officer
Moses is quickly on the scene.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.200
Let me. I speak perfect Chinese.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.680
Your passport is out of date.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.840
Out of date your passport is.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.640
No?

05:41.640 --> 05:43.240
Parlez-vous francais?

05:43.240 --> 05:45.800
Sprechen sie Deutsch?

05:47.600 --> 05:50.520
That's a shame. I don't speak any
German.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.000
Other than "Sprechen sie
Deutsch?" I'll try mime.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.680
No?

06:10.680 --> 06:16.680
Unable to overcome the language
barrier, Moses is forced to
think outside the box.

06:16.680 --> 06:20.000
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going
to give you this

06:20.000 --> 06:23.440
and you've got to go outside

06:23.440 --> 06:25.680
and get on a bus to London,

06:25.680 --> 06:29.720
and hopefully you'll find your
way back to China from there.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.920
I think he's getting some of it.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.040
Right, off you go, off you go.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.200
That's right. Bye bye. Bye bye.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.960
Get on the bus, that's right.
Bye bye. Bye bye.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.880
At Great British Air,
we do like to go the extra mile.

06:47.360 --> 06:52.360
It's 12 pm and love is in the air.

06:52.360 --> 06:58.240
Tommy isn't due at work for another
four hours, but has come in early,
because someone has caught his eye.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.520
'I'm so early today because there's
a wee lassie who works at FlyLo
check-in'

07:01.520 --> 07:05.320
and I really fancy her. She's the
most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

07:05.320 --> 07:10.040
In fact, she's so beautiful she
shouldn't be working here, she
should be working at a tanning

07:10.040 --> 07:13.000
salon. I've never actually spoke
to her in the flesh, but last week

07:13.000 --> 07:15.920
I sent her a love letter with a
chicken nugget sellotaped to it.

07:15.920 --> 07:21.400
And today's a big day, because I'm
going to ask her if she wants to
come out for dinner with me tonight.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.880
In fact, I've actually booked a
table at KFC, so fingers crossed.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.520
There's a queue here.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.480
Right.

07:37.040 --> 07:42.640
Next please. Where are you flying to
today? Right, OK...

07:42.640 --> 07:47.160
Simon and Jackie are Britain's
first husband and wife flying team.

07:47.160 --> 07:53.040
But ever since Simon had an
affair five years ago, the couple
have had a stormy relationship.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.494
You need to have your back waxed
as well. It's disgusting.

07:55.494 --> 07:57.338
It's like going to bed with a monkey.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.600
Fuel left and right,
tank two-and-a-half.

08:00.600 --> 08:06.840
During the preparation for today's
flight, Jackie has spotted a
familiar name on the staff rota.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.440
She's on the plane.
She's on the plane.

08:09.440 --> 08:13.320
The stewardess who slept with
Simon, she's cabin crew today.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.000
There she is, over there.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.920
She doesn't know me but I know her.

08:16.920 --> 08:20.160
Oh, yes.
Not as attractive as I thought.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.418
She must have put on weight,
probably the guilt.

08:22.418 --> 08:27.561
Look at her, undressing those
men with her eyes.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.920
- Welcome on board.
-  Welcome on board!

08:28.920 --> 08:30.960
That's what she said to Simon.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.960
Just before he put it in her.

08:32.960 --> 08:37.520
Holiday Inn, Glasgow, April
27th 2005. It was a Thursday.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.640
I'm not going to mention it though.
I've moved on.

08:40.640 --> 08:47.160
Ladies and gentleman,
welcome on board this Great British
Air flight 287 to Barcelona.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.440
We'll be taking off
in just a few minutes.

08:49.440 --> 08:53.160
Our cabin crew on board today will
be happy to help you in any way they

08:53.160 --> 08:57.200
can, especially Sally Wicks who will
get down on her knees to help you.

08:57.200 --> 09:02.240
Just don't leave her alone with your
husbands ladies, because Sally Wicks
is nothing more than a trollop.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.880
Right, that's it. No Simon,
I'm going to say it.

09:04.880 --> 09:11.360
Sally Wicks is a is a jezebel.
She's a homewrecker. She is the
slutty slut slut of the skies.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.960
Enjoy the flight!

09:20.440 --> 09:24.080
- Do you want cream or ice cream with
your apple pie tonight? - Ice cream.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.480
Good, because we've
got some in the freezer.

09:26.480 --> 09:33.280
It's lunchtime, but for Chief
Immigration Officer Ian
there's never a moment's rest.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.240
As Immigration Officer,
you have to stay alert 24/7.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.640
Except at night when
there are no planes.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.680
So I'm always thinking of new ways
to keep my staff on their toes.

09:42.680 --> 09:49.800
Today I am transforming myself into
your typical illegal immigrant
from the South American area.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.680
My goal will be to enter the
country without being apprehended.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.080
Let's see how tight the UK's
Border Control really is.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.160
Hello, Ian.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.720
Well done, Kenneth. Very eagle-eyed.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.160
My staff do
tend to spot me most of the time.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.440
I say most - so far they've spotted
me every time, but I'm factoring in

10:24.440 --> 10:28.040
times in the future when I will slip
through unobserved.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.240
Next please.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.442
Tommy is still waiting to ask
Melody out for dinner,

10:33.442 --> 10:36.271
and has now
been queuing for over an hour.

10:36.271 --> 10:38.600
Who's next, please?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.920
- You're next.
- Who's next please?

10:47.760 --> 10:51.760
Hello. Where are you flying to
today?

10:51.760 --> 10:53.360
Er. "Pragooey."

10:53.360 --> 10:55.040
You mean Prague?

10:55.040 --> 10:56.640
Aye.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.360
Next please.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.240
- Do you have a ticket?
- No.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.320
'It didn't quite
go according to plan.'

11:08.320 --> 11:11.600
I've got to fly to the Czech
Republic now, which I shouldn't

11:11.600 --> 11:15.520
really do, because I'm supposed
to start work in ten minutes.

11:15.520 --> 11:20.960
Oh, can you call KFC for me and
tell them I'm sorry, but I'm going
to have to let the table go?

11:21.960 --> 11:26.040
Mickey and Buster, the airport
paparazzi, are taking a short break.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.560
They have firm opinions on
the best kind of celebrities.

11:29.560 --> 11:33.640
Oh, most of the celebrities we
photograph are very nice as it goes.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.000
Yeah, if I had to pick a
favourite I'd probably
say, err, Colonel Gaddafi.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.440
- Lovely fella. - Always stops by
for a chat, asks after the wife.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.800
- I tell you who else is nice - Robert
Mugabe. - Oh, salt of the earth.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.680
See, he knows the value of
a good picture, don't he?

11:47.680 --> 11:52.080
He came through the other day and
someone had left a sombrero lying
around.

11:52.080 --> 11:57.400
we asked him to
put it on and he couldn't
have been more obliging.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.880
We got some very
funny photos, didn't we? Yeah.

11:59.880 --> 12:04.840
Yeah. Who did we snap the other
day, lovely guy from North Korea?

12:04.840 --> 12:08.040
Oh, the old, er, the old, er, the
old, er, the old, er, Kim Jong.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.160
Kim Jong. Kim Jong.
Kim Jong come through the other day.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.680
Yeah, yeah and Jordan
arrived at the same time.

12:13.680 --> 12:18.200
So we got them to pose together -
made for a lovely spread in OK!
magazine.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.000
That's it, yeah, we got in OK!
magazine.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.840
It's here, yeah we
got it here. Open it up and show
them. Here we go.

12:23.840 --> 12:29.360
Yeah, I took that. He took that. I
took that. I took that.
He took that.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.760
I took that. I took that.
Yeah everyone wins, really.

12:31.760 --> 12:36.920
We make a few quid, Jordan
gets her face out there and we
see the lighter side of Kim. Yeah.

12:36.920 --> 12:43.040
Lunchtime is normally a busy time
for the coffee kiosk, but today
Precious is having to close early.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.000
Well, today something
very mysterious occurred.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.440
We got coffee, we got cup, we
got sugar, we got sweetener,

12:49.440 --> 12:52.455
we got full fat milk, we got low fat milk,
we got soya milk

12:52.455 --> 12:57.360
for the lactose intolerant community,
and we got gas for to give us a hot,

12:57.360 --> 13:00.000
hot fire, but the Lord in his
almighty wisdom

13:00.000 --> 13:03.560
has decided that today
will be the day when we got no water.

13:03.560 --> 13:10.040
Looks like someone, and I don't
know who, has taken a hacksaw
and cut through the water pipe.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.920
Who would do such a thing?

13:12.920 --> 13:16.400
Well, anyway the plumber here now,
but it going to take hours

13:16.400 --> 13:19.880
to fix so me got no option but
to go to London town with my sisters

13:19.880 --> 13:22.840
and catch the matinee performance
of Dirty Dancing.

13:22.840 --> 13:27.200
Praise the Lord for the two-for-one
ticket offer! I've fixed it. What?

13:27.200 --> 13:31.840
I've put a new length of pipe in
so it should be working for you.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.440
There you go.

13:33.440 --> 13:37.120
May the Lord smite thee down.

13:40.240 --> 13:45.703
It's 3pm and the Woods family are checking in
for their annual summer holiday,

13:46.527 --> 13:47.566
but there's a hiccup.

13:47.601 --> 13:51.160
I have actually got you
booked in on this flight,
but not until next Monday.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.280
Eh? You're on the same flight, but
I'm afraid you've come a week early.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.840
- John! - Oh, sorry, love.
- Dad! What are we going to do?

13:56.840 --> 14:01.760
Well, there's no point driving all
the way home and coming back, is
there? We might as well stay here.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.360
Can we wait here?

14:03.360 --> 14:06.680
Well, I'm sorry, sir, that's not
so good for the other passengers.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.160
Are we all right here?

14:10.160 --> 14:12.480
No, sorry, sir.

14:12.480 --> 14:16.800
- We're all right here though?
- No.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.240
Here?

14:21.440 --> 14:24.640
Well, passengers do sometimes get
the dates of their flights wrong.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.600
I mean, we had a gentleman recently
who turned up a year late

14:27.600 --> 14:29.760
for his flight to
Manchester, but luckily

14:29.760 --> 14:32.920
for him the plane was
delayed so actually he
managed to board on time.

14:32.920 --> 14:37.920
Great British Air stewardess Penny
is thrilled that Princess Anne

14:37.920 --> 14:41.360
is planning to fly
with the airline next week.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.960
I'm not surprised that the
Princess has chosen to fly with us.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.640
It's well known that we do provide
the finest First Class service.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.440
For example, all us stewardesses
are now trained in massage therapy.

14:52.440 --> 14:59.960
So on long haul flights we can offer
shiatsu, Swedish, deep tissue - all
of which come with a happy ending.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.000
Morning.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
A member of the Royal household has
been sent to inspect the cabin.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.720
So the flight is next Tuesday.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.880
Yes, it is Tuesday but I'd
rather you didn't broadcast it.

15:09.880 --> 15:13.800
And that should give you
sufficient time to completely
repaint and recarpet the cabin.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.920
Yes, yes, of course.

15:15.920 --> 15:19.480
May I say, how honoured I am
that the Princess is flying with us.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.880
I have personally admired
her for many, many years.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.880
One thing the Princess
Royal despises is sycophancy.

15:24.880 --> 15:29.360
We need to discuss Princess
Anne, the Princess Royal's,
dietary requirements.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.278
- Do you provide a fruit salad?
- Yes, we do.

15:31.278 --> 15:35.023
Wonderful. Princess Anne,
the Princess Royal, adores fruit salad,

15:35.023 --> 15:38.800
but she can be a trifle choosy about
what sort of fruit she has in it.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.400
What does your salad contain?

15:40.400 --> 15:44.440
- Grapes. - The Princess
Royal does not eat grapes.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.360
- Strawberries? - No.
- Kiwi? - No.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.640
- Orange? - No.
- Guava? - No.

15:48.641 --> 15:50.033
- Lychee? - No.
- Pomegranate? - No.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.630
- Passion fruit? - No.
- Grapefruit? - No.

15:52.630 --> 15:54.134
- Pear? - No.
- Gooseberries? - No.

15:54.134 --> 15:56.079
- Blackberries? - No.
- Melon? - No.

15:56.079 --> 15:57.931
- Mango? - No.
- Peach? - No.

15:57.931 --> 15:59.221
- Pineapple?
- No.

15:59.221 --> 16:02.520
- Apple? - Yes.
- Plum? - No.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.840
- So just apples?
- Yes.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.520
So I should just give
the Princess an apple?

16:07.520 --> 16:09.800
Yes. Do you provide yoghurt?

16:09.800 --> 16:14.240
Yes, we have the finest organic
yoghurt flown in daily from Guernsey.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.440
The Princess detests yoghurt.

16:17.440 --> 16:21.040
Baggage handlers at the airport...

16:21.040 --> 16:24.560
have their part to play
in keeping air travel safe.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.560
One of the things that I like
to do is carry out

16:27.560 --> 16:29.880
my own personal security checks.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.400
It's not part of our
official remit, is it, Dad?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.720
No, boy, but I feel it gives the
public peace of mind, you know.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.320
- Right, what we got here?
Yeah, that one looks good. - This one?

16:39.320 --> 16:42.560
Yeah, the Louis Vuitton. Right, OK.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.720
Ah, it's got a lock on it.

16:44.720 --> 16:48.000
Ah, that's no bother. There we go.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.080
Right. Get that there.

16:52.080 --> 16:56.880
Oh, hello. Yeah, you see,
now, very common, it's a laptop.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.800
This could have illegal images on it.

16:58.800 --> 17:03.000
So we'll, er, take that
home for further analysis.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.040
Right, what else we got?

17:05.040 --> 17:07.955
Hello. "Gucky." Now the thing
about the shoes,

17:07.955 --> 17:10.886
you can have
explosive devices in the heel.

17:11.320 --> 17:13.480
So, er, we'll also take them home.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.560
Plus they're my size.

17:14.560 --> 17:19.920
Go and have a look in here. Ha-ha!
Here we go. Very common problem,
this. The i-Pod.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.640
Yeah, now you're not allowed to
have these on on take off or landing.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.840
Yeah, but they won't be able
to use it, it'll be in the hold.

17:26.840 --> 17:31.760
Point of principle, son.
Right what have we got in here?

17:31.760 --> 17:35.440
What's that? "Chay-nell Pour Om."
Nah, you're not allowed liquids
on board.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.360
So, er, yeah, we'll
set that down there.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.040
There's an aerosol in here.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.400
You're not allowed them.
We should take that out. Eh?

17:41.400 --> 17:44.520
We're not gonna get nothing for that
down the market are we? Silly sod.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.640
Right, that one's good to go.

17:48.080 --> 17:53.760
Omar Baba is famous for his playboy
lifestyle, and he now hopes
to cash in on this notoriety.

17:53.760 --> 17:57.240
with his own unique take
on the Mile High Club.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.480
This is my "Loveatory".

18:06.360 --> 18:09.960
As you can see, it is very romantic.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.760
We have cushioned area here for
extra comfort on the lady bottom.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.320
Commemorative tissue
there, with my face on.

18:16.320 --> 18:20.360
Also on the back of safety
card you have a number of
love-making positions.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.400
And this one I
do with some of my wives.

18:24.400 --> 18:30.520
And you can have as long
as you like to explore and
satisfy each other's bodies.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.880
As long as it's under two minutes.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.600
After two minutes, you hear
this noise.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.760
'This is Omar. Stop doing a sex in
my toilet. Thank you.'

18:38.760 --> 18:44.720
Excuse me, I have
some business to attend to.

18:45.882 --> 18:46.547
*

18:47.047 --> 18:47.547
*

18:47.640 --> 18:51.680
FlyLo Flight 475 has just
touched down and the customer

18:51.680 --> 18:56.760
service desk is about to receive
another onslaught from regular
passengers, Peter and Judith.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.680
Right, I'm going to give
that woman a piece of my mind.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.760
- Judith, please calm down.
- No Peter, I will not be becalmed.

19:02.760 --> 19:07.320
We have had, and I never
thought I'd utter these
words, the holiday from hell.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.080
By way of apology for
the previous debacle,

19:10.080 --> 19:15.040
FlyLo offered us a very good deal
on a package holiday to Colombia.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.240
Now as soon as we came
out of Bogota airport...

19:17.240 --> 19:20.640
As soon as we came out of
Bogota airport, Peter was
bitten by a rabid dog.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.320
Within minutes, he was howling
and foaming at the mouth.

19:23.320 --> 19:27.360
My first thought was "Can I have
Peter put down?" I looked into it...

19:27.360 --> 19:29.360
But the doctors said
it was unethical.

19:29.360 --> 19:33.120
Yes, thank you, Peter. But the
doctors said it was unethical.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.920
Peter became more and more ill.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.880
- I had diarrhoea and was projectile
vomiting. - Peter, don't be so crude!

19:38.880 --> 19:41.960
- Sorry Judith. - Peter had diarrhoea
and was projectile vomiting.

19:41.960 --> 19:45.400
If you'd spun him round, you'd have
thought he was a catherine wheel.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.594
- So we decided.... - So I decided
that the best course of action

19:48.594 --> 19:50.736
was to take the first plane home.

19:50.771 --> 19:55.160
Now while we were waiting at the
airport, a very charming man called

19:55.160 --> 19:58.091
Carlos approached me
and offered me 5,000 $

19:58.091 --> 20:02.201
- to take his briefcase through
Customs. - I had reservations...

20:01.200 --> 20:04.720
Peter had reservations but we were
saving up for a loft conversion, so

20:04.720 --> 20:07.520
I said "Yes", and gave the
briefcase to Peter to carry.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.858
- When we landed in England...

20:08.858 --> 20:11.795
- Peter, if I could just get a
word in edgeways! - Sorry, Judith.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.240
I should hope so too, Peter.

20:13.240 --> 20:17.200
When we landed in England,
Peter was stopped at customs.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.400
They searched the briefcase and
found 20 kilograms of cocaine,

20:21.400 --> 20:23.480
with a street value of
half a million pounds.

20:23.480 --> 20:29.200
Peter was arrested and is
looking at a prison sentence
of no less than 12 years.

20:29.200 --> 20:34.040
If I had to rate the holiday
out of five, I'd struggle
to give it more than three.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.627
Back in the First Class cabin,

20:38.627 --> 20:43.067
Penny is still busy making preparations
for Princess Anne's flight.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.720
Now each passenger has their own
in-flight entertainment system

20:46.720 --> 20:50.520
that allows them to browse
genres and choose from all
of the latest releases.

20:50.520 --> 20:55.480
Princess Anne, the Princess Royal,
is extremely particular about
which actors she's willing to watch.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.440
A list of approved
actors is as follows.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.000
- Let me just get a pen.
- Quickly.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.327
- Yes? - Jason Statham.

21:02.327 --> 21:05.873
- Jet Li. - Yes.
- Dolph Lundgren. - Yes.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.372
- Arnold Schwarzenegger. - Yes.
- Sylvester Stallone.

21:08.372 --> 21:12.321
Oh, well, there is a film
with all those people in.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.720
I believe it's called
The Expendables.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.840
Maybe I could order that in
especially for the Princess.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.920
Princess Anne, the Princess Royal
has already seen The Expendables.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.075
- Did she like it?
- No, she did not.

21:22.075 --> 21:27.281
She said it wasn't nearly violent enough
and I quote, "It was for pussies".

21:28.000 --> 21:30.320
WishWings. If you'll pardon the pun.

21:30.320 --> 21:34.520
Moses has spent the afternoon
collecting money for his
charity, WishWings.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.520
Oh, thank you very much, that's
very generous. I'll make sure
most of that goes to the charity.

21:38.520 --> 21:42.360
And he's now on his way to meet a
very important passenger...

21:42.360 --> 21:43.600
Happy flighting.

21:43.600 --> 21:49.200
..who's come all the way from
Albert Square. Barbara Windsor MBE.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.040
Get out of my pub, please! Ha-ha!

21:52.040 --> 21:55.920
Miss Windsor, my name is Moses. I've
been asked to take you
through to the gate.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.680
- Oh, do we have to go now?
- No, not for another hour.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.720
Oh, right.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.280
Can I ask you
a question, Miss Windsor?

22:09.280 --> 22:11.160
Yes, course you can, darling.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.720
How on earth did you get an MBE?

22:15.360 --> 22:16.560
I beg your pardon?

22:16.560 --> 22:19.434
I've seen your bra flying off in
those Carry On films,

22:19.434 --> 22:20.770
and I've watched you shouting at people

22:20.805 --> 22:23.280
in EastEnders, and I thought
it can't have been for that.

22:23.280 --> 22:28.800
Well, I got it for services to
entertainment and, actually,
I do a lot for charity.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.080
- I do a lot for charity.
- Oh, really?

22:31.080 --> 22:35.680
Yes. I run a charity called
WishWings, if you'll pardon the pun.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.360
But I myself have never
been given an honour.

22:38.360 --> 22:41.818
- Oh, right. - A lot of people
say to me "Moses,

22:41.818 --> 22:43.682
you should really have an OBE

22:43.682 --> 22:48.880
"or a knighthood", but I don't do it
for that. I do it for the children.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.080
Well, yes, that has
to be the reason.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.200
Yes.

22:53.200 --> 22:57.520
But I still want one. Can you get me
one? Because you've managed
to wangle yourself one.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.360
No, sorry, I can't do that.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.200
Selfish.

23:04.600 --> 23:08.760
Oh, erm, Miss Windsor, can
I just have your autograph, please?

23:08.760 --> 23:11.680
Yes, of course you can.

23:14.640 --> 23:15.800
Excuse me, what's this?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.400
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.
-  No, no, no.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.720
Just sign at the bottom there.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.960
"Dear Queen, I'm writing on behalf
of my dear friend Moses Beacon.

23:23.960 --> 23:27.600
"His charity WishWings,
if you'll pardon the pun..."

23:27.600 --> 23:29.640
- But there's no pun there.
- Yes, there is.

23:29.640 --> 23:35.880
"..has helped literally three
children achieve the flight of their
lives, if you'll pardon the pun."

23:35.880 --> 23:37.560
There's no pun there either.

23:37.560 --> 23:42.720
- Yes, there is. - "You may like to
know that the Honorary President
of WishWings is Tania Bryer."

23:42.720 --> 23:45.400
- Now who's Tania Bryer?
- That's low.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.680
"You should definitely make him
a knight or at least an OBE.

23:49.680 --> 23:53.200
"Though not just an MBE that
would be a bit of an insult.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.880
"Yours sincerely, Barbara Windsor.

23:55.880 --> 23:59.560
"You know, that little old
common lady off the TV."

23:59.560 --> 24:01.200
Do you need a pen?

24:01.200 --> 24:03.120
Piss off.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.640
Back in the First Class cabin,

24:06.640 --> 24:08.480
Princess Anne's lady-in-waiting

24:08.480 --> 24:10.280
has completed her inspection.

24:10.280 --> 24:13.440
I very much look forward to
meeting the Princess on Tuesday.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.040
Don't look at her, don't talk to
her, don't make a lunge at her.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.080
I wasn't going to.

24:17.080 --> 24:21.760
I know a lunger when I see one. In
fact I shall make a personal request
that you are not on the flight.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.800
Good day.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.600
Ho-huh!

24:30.280 --> 24:35.040
What an awful snob that woman was.

24:35.040 --> 24:40.440
After Jackie's outburst on the
plane, she and Simon have some news.

24:40.440 --> 24:45.200
- Yes, I decided that the best thing
to do was for us to separate.
- Well, actually, I said it first.

24:45.200 --> 24:50.280
Yeah, but I thought of it before
you said it, so, technically
Simon, it was my decision.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.280
Yeah, I mean we're still
working together obviously.

24:53.280 --> 24:57.320
We're still living together,
we've only got one bedroom so
we're still sharing a bed.

24:57.320 --> 25:00.920
The only difference really
is that we're not physically
intimate with each other.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.200
Well, we haven't been
for five years anyway.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.480
No. So I've just started dogging.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.074
- Really?
- Yes, it's very nice.

25:09.074 --> 25:10.463
Where do you do that?

25:10.498 --> 25:16.160
- In the cul-de-sac. -  What, and other
people are there having sex? - Yes.

25:16.160 --> 25:19.080
- We're all having a gay old time.
- Anyone I know?

25:19.080 --> 25:21.920
I don't know, I've
only seen them from waist down.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.760
It's been a long week for the
Woods family

25:26.760 --> 25:29.280
who are still waiting
for their flight.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.000
It's been all right. We make do.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.720
Yeah, I mean you talk to the other
passengers and you make new friends.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.800
Then they have to fly away of course.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.400
Yeah, but then you see we're
here to greet them when they
come back, which is nice.

25:40.400 --> 25:45.040
It was our anniversary last night,
so we sat the kids in front of the

25:45.040 --> 25:47.938
departure boards and we took
the monorail down to Terminal 2

25:47.938 --> 25:49.629
and we went to the Cafe Rouge.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.000
Yeah, they gave us a lovely
little table outside, near Tie Rack.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.040
And on the weekend we took
the kids out for a treat,
down to Baggage Reclaim.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.360
Yeah, we played a little
game with them, didn't we?

25:58.360 --> 26:01.200
"Can you guess what colour
the next case is going to be?".

26:01.200 --> 26:04.200
- Sometimes they're black, sometimes
they're grey. - Ooh, the red one.

26:04.200 --> 26:08.600
Oh, yeah, we saw a red one the
other day. That was very amusing.

26:12.640 --> 26:17.320
We went to the Bureau de Change,
and we changed our money into
Turkish and then back again.

26:17.320 --> 26:20.040
That was a fun eight minutes. Hm.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.815
- Smoothies.
- Oh, yes.

26:28.815 --> 26:32.374
We've discovered that they give out
little samples of smoothies,

26:32.400 --> 26:37.200
and if you collect enough of them
during the day, by six o'clock
you got your own full-size smoothie.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.240
That's about it really.

26:42.920 --> 26:45.240
Been a quiet sort of week.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.560
- Oh, you won that Ferrari in the
raffle. - I did. That was nice. Yeah.

26:53.240 --> 26:58.560
Night falls, and another
day in the life of the
airport draws to a close.

26:58.560 --> 27:03.200
The Woods family ended up
missing their flight and are
still living in the terminal.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.000
- Move your fat arse.
- I'm moving my fat arse.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.800
Mickey and Buster added to
their portfolio of world leaders

27:09.800 --> 27:13.600
when they snapped Vladimir Putin
playing frisbee with Abi Titmuss.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.040
And Ian Foot remains vigilant.

27:16.040 --> 27:21.120
Well, I've actually got the
whole variety of disguises here.

27:21.120 --> 27:27.680
Got Australian, Rastafarian,
Russian, Lady Gaga

27:27.680 --> 27:30.480
and Scotch.

27:30.480 --> 27:35.520
Unfortunately these days there
are more and more Scottish people
trying to gain access to Britain.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.040
Keep 'em out, I say. Keep 'em out!
