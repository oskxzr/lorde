00:00.700 --> 00:04.680
This series looks at life in one
of Britain's busiest airports.

00:05.180 --> 00:09.800
On today's show, Flylo owner
Omar Baba takes on his rivals.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.040
British Airways, you are the
son of a whore. I spit on you.

00:13.040 --> 00:17.440
Fearghal's flight hits turbulence.
Is that your wee sick bag?

00:17.440 --> 00:18.880
OK, thanks for that.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.800
Someone had lasagne,
didn't they?

00:20.800 --> 00:24.240
And Friends' star David Schwimmer
has trouble at Customs.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.999
Check-In

00:35.000 --> 00:36.999
Passenger Liaison

00:37.000 --> 00:37.999
Steward

00:39.000 --> 00:40.999
Paparazzi

00:42.000 --> 00:43.999
Coffee Seller

00:44.000 --> 00:44.999
Immigration Officer

00:45.000 --> 00:45.999
Ground Crew

00:46.000 --> 00:46.999
Flight Attendant

00:48.000 --> 00:48.999
Airline Owner

00:49.000 --> 00:49.999
Burger Assistant

00:50.000 --> 00:50.999
Passengers

00:52.000 --> 00:52.999
Pilots

00:57.840 --> 00:59.320
Good morning, good morning...

00:59.320 --> 01:02.500
It's 8 am and airline
owner Omar Baba

01:02.501 --> 01:06.000
is launching an unbelievable
transatlantic deal.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.240
Today I announce the launch of
the Flylo £1 flight to New York!

01:11.240 --> 01:14.840
Yes, you are correct!
£1 to New York City.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.320
(With a small booking
fee of £480.)

01:19.320 --> 01:23.240
In an effort to make his service more
attractive to business passengers,

01:23.240 --> 01:28.010
Omar is introducing brand new
flat beds across his entire fleet.

01:28.020 --> 01:34.480
OK, it looks like normal seat, but is
a flat bed at the press of the button.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.040
Well, good night.

01:49.880 --> 01:53.560
Wake me up when we
get to Birmingham.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.960
The early morning Our Lady Air
flight from Cork has hit turbulence,

02:08.960 --> 02:14.320
but cabin crew member Fearghal is
quick to reassure his passengers.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.720
Hello, is your name Holly?

02:16.720 --> 02:20.480
Your mummy tells me you've been
feeling a wee bit scared, is that right?

02:20.480 --> 02:24.480
Yeah, she just gets a bit frightened,
especially with all the turbulence.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.350
Oh, you don't need
to worry about that.

02:26.460 --> 02:29.010
That's just like a wee
little pocket of air.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.200
Like driving along
a bumpy road.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.400
- You see?
- Yeah.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.399
I've got somebody who's
going to look after you,

02:34.400 --> 02:36.320
would you like
to meet him?

02:36.400 --> 02:37.320
Yeah?

02:37.320 --> 02:43.600
Hello, my name's Brandon O'Bear,
I'd like to be your best friend.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.400
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.960
35 euro.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.560
Next, please.

02:49.560 --> 02:54.880
Meanwhile, over at the Flylo check-in,
Melody is faced with a common problem.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.760
Oh, I'm sorry, madam, your case is
too heavy to go in the hold, madam.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.280
I'm going to have to ask you,
madam,

03:00.290 --> 03:03.280
to remove some items
from the case, please, madam.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.440
Madam.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.200
How's that now?

03:16.200 --> 03:17.880
Still over, I'm afraid, madam.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.900
'All we hear from passengers'

03:20.000 --> 03:22.840
'is that they don't like the
new baggage allowance rules,'

03:22.840 --> 03:25.840
but honestly, what do you
really need to take on holiday?

03:25.840 --> 03:28.680
Some Hawaiian Tropic, a couple
of pairs of bikini bottoms

03:28.680 --> 03:30.160
and a pregnancy testing kit.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.664
I'm very sorry, madam,
it's still too heavy.

03:34.664 --> 03:36.369
How much over is it?

03:36.404 --> 03:38.240
Five kilos.
New Flylo rules.

03:38.240 --> 03:42.240
New baggage allowance is outlined very
clearly on the Flylo website, madam.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.000
I was just about to
tell the lady that.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.700
What my colleague should
have informed you, madam,

03:45.750 --> 03:47.600
is that it does
state very clearly

03:47.600 --> 03:48.999
on the Flylo website
that before you travel

03:49.000 --> 03:51.560
you do need to check
the Flylo website, madam.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.280
- I didn't realise...
- www.Flylo.co.uk...

03:55.285 --> 03:58.280
- Right.
- .com.org.net.com.

03:58.281 --> 03:58.870
Right.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.000
Then .com again. It's very simple,

04:00.280 --> 04:04.600
www.Flylo.co.uk.com.org.net.com.com.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.200
Yes, thank you, Keeley.
Always happy to help, Melody.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.320
Still over, I'm afraid.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.860
Ah! That's fine now, madam.
Have a good flight.

04:20.770 --> 04:21.350
Next, please.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.440
Since they've both been up for
the job of check-in manager,

04:24.440 --> 04:27.160
tensions have arisen between
the two best friends.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.320
If I get promoted as
check-in manager, well,

04:30.320 --> 04:32.520
when I get promoted
as check-in manager,

04:32.520 --> 04:35.720
I'm going to use the extra money
to have a breast enhancement.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.480
I actually had mine
done when I was 12.

04:37.480 --> 04:41.080
I could only afford to get one done,
so I had this one done at Christmas.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.180
I went from a D to an F,
but if I get promoted,

04:43.190 --> 04:45.080
I can have this
one done as well.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.980
Yeah, see if you can do
a deal with the surgeon

04:46.985 --> 04:49.880
and get him to do your
face at the same time.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.820
On the other side of the airport,

04:51.830 --> 04:56.320
Flylo employee Taaj has just been
told of a serious plane malfunction.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.560
See what happened was was we was just
getting the plane out of the hanger

05:00.560 --> 05:01.480
and the wing fell off,

05:01.500 --> 05:04.880
so what they've got to do is
stick the wing back on the plane,

05:04.880 --> 05:08.040
but they've got to get themselves
some special aeroplane glue, isn't it?

05:08.040 --> 05:09.760
So there's going to be
a little bit of a delay,

05:09.770 --> 05:12.760
but thing is, I don't
want to tell passengers this

05:12.760 --> 05:14.760
because it might make
them tiny bit nervous,

05:14.770 --> 05:17.320
so I've just been thinking of other
things that I can tell them instead.

05:18.820 --> 05:19.750
Excuse me?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.360
Yes, boss? What's the delay?

05:21.360 --> 05:27.000
Erm, a volcano has erupted in Bradford
and is spewing out all ash and that.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.520
We've had a phone call from a
women who lives near the airport,

05:30.520 --> 05:34.440
and she's having a barbeque today,
and she says please can we have

05:34.440 --> 05:37.640
no planes flying overhead
because it's a bit noisy.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.000
We've run out of Appletize,
so it's not safe to travel.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.800
The pilot parked the plane and he
can't remember where he left it.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.250
One of the stewards has got eczema
so it would be a bit risky, isn't it?

05:46.260 --> 05:49.150
It's getting quite dark and the
pilot is worried about flying the plane

05:49.160 --> 05:51.000
at night in case he
can't see anything.

05:51.000 --> 05:51.980
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really!

05:52.000 --> 05:54.480
How would you like to
fly a plane at night?

05:54.480 --> 05:57.470
The pilot's still at home, Cos
he's watching Avatar on DVD

05:57.480 --> 05:59.000
and he didn't realise
how long it was.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.880
One of the stewards is a batty
boy and he's just found out

06:01.880 --> 06:03.375
his boyfriend's been
bumming someone else

06:03.380 --> 06:06.680
and he's just crying
and crying, so we can't fly.

06:06.680 --> 06:07.570
That's ridiculous.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.080
I want a full refund.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.199
But we cannot give a refund

06:10.200 --> 06:11.999
because it is an
act of God, isn't it?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.720
How is that an act of God?

06:13.720 --> 06:15.920
God made him batty.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.840
Come on, come on, boy.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.440
Mickey and Buster, the airport's
paparazzi, have just received

06:21.440 --> 06:25.240
a tip-off that a very important
passenger is about to touch down.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.720
Her Majesty the Queen.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.400
- Yeah, love the Queen.
- Lovely old Queen.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.000
Thing about the Queen is she's done
nothing but good for this country,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.240
and when you see her on a postage
stamp you can't help thinking,

06:37.240 --> 06:40.280
- "Oh! She's a fine looking woman."
I would. - I would an' all.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.680
- In fact, I'd take a photo of you
doing it. -That's very kind of you.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.075
Be lovely to have a memento.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.920
Yeah, I'm a traditional
royalist, you know what I mean?

06:47.920 --> 06:51.600
When the National Anthem comes on,
I'm always first on my feet. Yeah.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.200
# God save our gracious dum
Long live our noble dum

06:56.200 --> 06:58.320
# Dum dum dum Queen

06:58.320 --> 07:02.240
# Land of hope and dum dum.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.480
# Rule Bri-dum dum #
Britannia rules the dum... #

07:06.640 --> 07:08.240
Oh, hold up,
what's going on?

07:09.240 --> 07:10.200
- Who is it?
- Hello.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.200
- Who is it?
- Hello.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.200
- Who is it?
- Oh, you're joking.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.400
- Who's joking?
- Oh, you're joking!

07:14.410 --> 07:15.400
- Who's joking?
- You're having a laugh!

07:15.410 --> 07:16.390
Who's having a laugh?

07:16.400 --> 07:19.680
The Queen has got straight off
her plane into her Daimler.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.475
She's half way round the M25.
We're not going to get a picture now.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.480
She's gone right up herself.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.200
I can't help thinking this whole
Queen thing's has gone to her head!

07:27.210 --> 07:28.200
Cow!

07:28.200 --> 07:30.840
All we was going to do was get
a nice little shot of her,

07:30.840 --> 07:34.720
crown on her head, corgi either side,
showing a nice of bit of cleavage...

07:34.720 --> 07:36.920
Boom, 50 quid from
the Daily Star.

07:36.920 --> 07:40.960
And if she's showing a bit of leg, we
could flog it to Nuts Magazine. But no.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.440
No, she's forgetting the fans. People
like us who put her where she is today.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.380
These celebrities complain
about the paparazzi,

07:46.390 --> 07:48.080
but it's a two-way
street, ain't it?

07:48.080 --> 07:49.270
Yeah, it's a two way street.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.320
Would she still be Queen if
we didn't photograph her?

07:53.320 --> 07:53.990
Yeah.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.950
Yeah, I suppose
she would yeah...

07:55.960 --> 07:58.440
- she's the Queen.
- she's the Queen after all.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.040
Ian Foot is the airport's
chief immigration officer.

08:08.040 --> 08:12.760
His job is to prevent illegal
immigrants from entering the UK.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.600
Working in immigration,

08:14.600 --> 08:18.960
you do sometimes get
labelled with the racism tag.

08:18.960 --> 08:22.760
I do take my job very seriously,
but I'm not in any way racist.

08:22.760 --> 08:27.880
In fact, one of my best friends
is friends with a man who's black.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.960
And he's very black.

08:29.960 --> 08:33.080
Oh, yeah. Man, he's black, yeah.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.720
Earlier today, Ian stopped a
passenger at passport control

08:37.720 --> 08:41.680
whom he believes is trying to gain
unlawful access into the country.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.520
Do you understand

08:46.520 --> 08:50.120
why I have brought you here?

08:50.120 --> 08:52.360
No, I don't.

08:52.360 --> 08:57.200
Well, it's clear to me that
you've got a forged passport.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.600
- No, I haven't.
- Oh, it's a forgery, all right.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.480
A very good one,
I'll grant you that.

09:01.480 --> 09:05.080
- But, er, there is one slight giveaway.
- And what is that?

09:05.080 --> 09:11.400
- There is no such country as Liberia.
- Yes, there is, it's in Africa.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.760
Oh, in Africa, you say.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.880
It's on a map, look on a map.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.800
All right, I will look on a map.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.240
Yeah, I think I'm going to enjoy this.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.000
Right.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.360
Liberia, you say? Yes.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.320
We've got a new one,
Chris, Liberia.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.960
Africa. Africa.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.440
Africa... Africa, Right, OK.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.000
So, Mrs Mbutu,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.680
would you be so
kind as to point out

09:40.680 --> 09:44.840
the location of this so-called Liberia?

09:46.240 --> 09:47.760
There.

09:50.440 --> 09:53.840
Oh, yes. Just hidden
underneath Sierra Leone.

09:58.440 --> 10:01.720
What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to let you in this time,

10:01.720 --> 10:05.440
but I would advise you, in future,
to travel with a large atlas or globe

10:05.440 --> 10:08.640
so you can prove to people you haven't
made up your country. Good day.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.160
This is disgraceful.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.600
- Right.
- You are a very ignorant man.

10:13.100 --> 10:13.740
All right.

10:13.745 --> 10:16.240
I am disgusted by the way
that I have been treated.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.920
- OK.
- May I leave now?!

10:17.920 --> 10:20.680
Yes.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.280
You have insulted the
people of my country.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.480
Yeah, I'm actually on
my lunch break now,

10:24.490 --> 10:27.080
so anything else you say
doesn't really count.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.720
Oh!

10:31.240 --> 10:33.320
Don't know what
rattled her cage.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.800
People come from far and
wide to work at the airport.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.120
Tommy is obsessed with planes,

10:42.330 --> 10:46.120
and it's always been his dream
to work in the aviation industry.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.600
I really, really
want to be a pilot,

10:48.600 --> 10:52.760
but I found out that you have to have
passed lots of exam...examinin...

10:52.760 --> 10:56.640
tests to be one. So what
I've decided to do instead

10:56.640 --> 11:01.800
is to get myself a job at the airport
then work my way up to being a pilot.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.200
Er, cheeseburger.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.960
Press cheeseburger.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.440
Large chocolate milkshake.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.000
Press large chocolate milkshake.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.160
Chicken nuggets.

11:26.280 --> 11:29.160
Press chicken nuggets.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.720
Two apple pies.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.760
Press apple pie.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.800
Press it again.

11:39.800 --> 11:44.040
I found it quite complicated,
but now I've served my first customer,

11:44.040 --> 11:47.160
I think I'm definitely on
my way to becoming a pilot.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.480
Now ask, "Would you
like fries with that?"

11:49.480 --> 11:52.480
Would you like fries with that?
Yeah, not me. Him.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.780
So next time you're
on a plane, listen out

11:53.781 --> 11:56.880
because you might
just hear a voice saying,

11:56.880 --> 11:58.280
"Ladies and gentlemen,

11:58.285 --> 12:02.280
"welcome on board, this is
Captain Tommy speaking.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.080
"Would you like
fries with that?"

12:05.720 --> 12:10.120
Meanwhile, there have been reports
of a serious incident in duty free,

12:10.120 --> 12:12.920
and the police are on
site within minutes.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.830
We've had reports of a
gentleman who's very drunk

12:15.835 --> 12:18.160
and has been abusive
to members of staff.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.120
I'll have a can of whiskey.
I tell you what, give us a kiss.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.400
It's all right, Margaret, I'll deal
with it. Calm down, please, sir.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.200
I just want one bottle of whiskey.
What's the matter?

12:27.200 --> 12:30.080
You appear to be very drunk and you've
been abusive to members of staff.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.640
I'll admit I've had a drink.
I've had a drink. I won't fool you.

12:32.640 --> 12:32.990
I've had a drink.

12:32.991 --> 12:35.040
I need to escort you
out of the terminal.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.720
I'm not going.
Me plane goes in half an hour.

12:38.721 --> 12:39.260
We need to take you outside,

12:39.300 --> 12:41.760
get you some fresh air inside
you and some black coffee.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.800
All right. I'll go.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.920
I fly better when I've had a couple of
drinks, anyway, you know what I mean.

12:51.800 --> 12:56.080
Oh, I'll be all right, once I get
up there. I'll open the window.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.640
The Our Lady Air flight
to Dublin is boarding.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.240
Morning. Morning.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.720
And Fearghal is breaking
in a new steward.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.040
I'm really excited
about today as it goes,

13:06.040 --> 13:08.960
cos I just qualified as a steward
and this is my first ever flight

13:08.960 --> 13:11.560
and, you know, being a
steward is great, you know,

13:11.560 --> 13:14.520
and the money's not bad, you
get to travel a lot and, er,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.840
meet loads of birds. All right.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.880
'Lasagne or coq au vin?'

13:18.880 --> 13:21.120
Lasagne or coq au vin?

13:21.120 --> 13:23.080
Hah... I had coq
au vin last night.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.600
Oh, right? Yeah, my friend's
just bought a transit.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.720
Lasagne or coq au vin?

13:32.720 --> 13:35.840
'I might be wrong, but I got a feeling'

13:35.840 --> 13:38.200
that the guy I'm working
with could be gay.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.480
Get you!

13:39.480 --> 13:42.800
I ain't got nothing against 'em,
but I'm not one myself, so what

13:42.800 --> 13:46.200
I'm going to do is I'm going to
subtly mention that I'm straight

13:46.200 --> 13:47.760
and hope he gets the message.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.320
Any duty free for you today?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.960
Any duty free for you today?

13:50.960 --> 13:54.160
- Any duty free for you today?
- Any duty free for you today?

13:54.160 --> 13:56.680
- Any duty free for you today?
- Any duty free for you today?

13:56.680 --> 13:58.600
Any duty free for you today?

13:58.600 --> 14:00.560
Yes, some Chanel No. 5, please.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.720
Oh, certainly, madam,
there you go.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.160
That's what my girlfriend likes.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.280
- Oh, right?
- Yeah, I buy it for my girlfriend.

14:09.280 --> 14:13.120
Cos my girlfriend likes it,
cos I really love my GIRLFRIEND.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.800
Great.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.480
Girlfriend!

14:17.480 --> 14:19.120
'I don't know what it is about Lee,'

14:19.120 --> 14:21.400
but I'm getting quite
a gay vibe from him.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.240
Mind you,
you know what they say.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.480
What's the difference between
a straight man and a bisexual?

14:26.480 --> 14:27.520
Two pints of lager.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.640
- Another pint of lager?
- Yeah, all right.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.640
Before their return
flight tomorrow,

14:32.640 --> 14:36.296
Lee and Fearghal have been booked
into a hotel in Dublin.

14:36.296 --> 14:38.137
Bottoms up.

14:38.172 --> 14:41.920
Ain't you drinking? No,
I like to stay in control.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.440
# You raise me up

14:47.440 --> 14:53.600
# So I can stand on mountains

14:53.600 --> 14:57.000
# You raise me up

14:57.000 --> 15:01.960
# To walk on stormy sea... #

15:04.560 --> 15:09.040
It's 8 am and back at the airport,
coffee kiosk employee Precious

15:09.040 --> 15:10.880
is faced with the
morning rush...

15:10.880 --> 15:12.160
Come on! Shoo!

15:12.160 --> 15:15.040
..but she's having
to close early.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.560
Problem today,
we got no paper cup.

15:17.560 --> 15:22.440
We got coffee, we got milk, we got
water, we got fire, we got sugar,

15:22.440 --> 15:26.760
we got sweetener, we got chocolate
sprinkle but we got no paper cup.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.600
Well, we suppose we got no option but
to spend the rest of the day playing

15:30.600 --> 15:34.000
on the fruit machines with
the petty cash from the till.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.600
Praise the lord for
the £30 jackpot.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.920
Closed. Oh, don't worry, me going to
give all me winnings to the church.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.760
On the third day he rose again.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.520
Hallelujah.

15:46.520 --> 15:51.800
# Kumbaya my Lord Kumbaya

15:51.800 --> 15:55.960
# Kumbaya my Lord Kumbaya

15:57.720 --> 16:02.000
# Kumbaya my Lord Kumbaya

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
# Oh Lord Kumbaya. #

16:05.000 --> 16:09.280
Over at the check-in desks,
Melody and Keeley are hard at work.

16:09.280 --> 16:13.360
To be honest, I really took this
job because I wanted to travel.

16:13.360 --> 16:17.360
I felt I needed to broaden my horizons,
and this year I've already

16:17.360 --> 16:21.400
flown to Birmingham,
Manchester and had a week in Luton.

16:21.400 --> 16:25.320
Since the opportunity for promotion
has arisen, Keeley has been keeping

16:25.320 --> 16:27.315
a close eye on her friend's
performance.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.520
Thank you.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.040
Melody, you didn't ask
the security questions.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.995
Oh, sorry, sir. I forgot to ask
you the security questions.

16:33.999 --> 16:34.720
OK.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.995
Did you pack the
case yourself?

16:36.000 --> 16:36.675
No.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.820
Could anyone have interfered with
your luggage at any point?

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
Yes.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.060
Did anyone ask you to bring
anything onto the aircraft?

16:42.080 --> 16:42.960
Yes.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.440
Does your bag contain any lighters,
aerosols or any sharp objects?

16:46.440 --> 16:47.620
Yes, all of those.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.360
Good.
Enjoy the flight.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.760
Yes, I think what happened earlier
with the security questions

16:53.770 --> 16:56.260
does show that whichever one
of us does get Helen's job,

16:56.280 --> 16:59.520
it's probably better if
it's someone with experience.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.040
I think experience is
important, but I know

17:02.040 --> 17:05.920
in my short time at the company I
have already made a big impact.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.640
I don't know if
you've seen this.

17:07.640 --> 17:11.280
This is the Flylo Hotties calendar
that was brought out last year.

17:11.280 --> 17:15.600
Omar Baba personally selected all the
sexiest girls who work for the airline.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.360
And I was actually Miss October.

17:18.360 --> 17:20.680
You weren't asked to do that,
were you, Keeley?

17:20.680 --> 17:23.720
No, I wasn't, Melody, but I
probably wouldn't get involved

17:23.720 --> 17:26.520
with something like that because
I think it's quite down market.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.600
You posted that video of you
and your boyfriend on You Porn.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.960
That was artistic.

17:30.960 --> 17:36.400
Simon and Jackie Trent are Britain's
first husband and wife pilot team.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.040
Five years ago Simon
had an affair,

17:39.040 --> 17:42.120
but the couple are keen to
put the incident behind them.

17:42.120 --> 17:47.680
Having re-trained as a pilot, Jackie now
accompanies Simon on all his flights.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.960
Yeah, well, obviously
it can be stressful.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.080
You live together, you work together.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.480
I don't find it stressful.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.720
What I'm saying is, you know,
sometimes there is that danger

17:56.720 --> 17:59.560
that you've had a row at home
and you bring it into work.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.360
No. Not a problem for me.

18:02.960 --> 18:07.520
'Swiftbird. 240 degrees
to intercept the ILS.'

18:07.520 --> 18:11.800
240 to intercept the ILS.
Swiftbird.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.160
'Swiftbird. When established,
clear to descend on the ILS,

18:15.160 --> 18:18.920
'runway 27, right.
Report at four Delta.'

18:18.920 --> 18:21.800
Clear to descend
on the ILS, Swiftbird.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.720
Can I just say you've got
a really lovely voice?

18:26.720 --> 18:28.360
'Er, thank you.'

18:28.360 --> 18:32.480
Yeah, you've just got
really lovely velvety tones.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.600
'Thanks.'

18:33.780 --> 18:37.000
I'm First Officer
Jackie Trent, by the way.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.160
'Oh. Um. I'm Nigel Stowe.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.520
'Nice to speak to you,
Jackie. Out.'

18:43.040 --> 18:44.720
Are you on Facebook?

18:46.240 --> 18:49.280
- 'Repeat that. Over.'
- Are you on Facebook? Over.

18:49.280 --> 18:49.860
Jackie...

18:49.880 --> 18:52.360
I just really want to
see what you look like.

18:53.240 --> 18:58.000
'Er, for the record, I'm tall,
I've got black hair and a moustache.'

18:58.000 --> 18:59.520
You sound hot. Over.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.420
Jackie, we've begun our descent.
I need you to concentrate.

19:02.420 --> 19:07.400
Oh, excuse me, Simon! I'm not the
one who screwed someone else!

19:13.400 --> 19:15.600
'Just to say you're
clear for final approach.'

19:15.600 --> 19:16.520
Thank you.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.200
- Did you Sky+ 'Strictly'?
- Yes.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.660
Back in the terminal, Taaj is
helping Flylo passengers

19:25.660 --> 19:27.560
check-in as quickly as possible.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.840
Is you travelling with
just hand luggage?

19:29.840 --> 19:32.440
- Is you travelling with
just hand luggage? - No.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.880
- Is you travelling with
just hand luggage? - No.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.840
Is you travelling with
just hand luggage?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.080
Is you travelling with just
hand luggage?

19:38.140 --> 19:39.380
- Yes.
- You is?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.480
OK, come with me madam
because we can now check you in

19:41.480 --> 19:44.360
electrono-logically, isn't it?

19:44.360 --> 19:48.120
But I do need to make sure that your
bag fits into the overhead locker.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.720
Well, it's not going
to fit in there, is it?

19:51.720 --> 19:56.760
Oh. Oh, no. Well, you better join
the back of the queue then, isn't it?

19:56.760 --> 19:59.040
This is ridiculous!
You couldn't get anything in there.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.240
No, I know. Me and my mates
was mucking about last night.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.000
I couldn't even get me cock in it.

20:07.440 --> 20:11.560
Moses looks after first and business
class passengers for Great British Air.

20:11.560 --> 20:15.120
He's just been alerted that there's
a very nervous flyer on board

20:15.120 --> 20:18.400
this flight to Budapest,
which is ready for take off.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.640
- Are you my frightened lady?
- Yes.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.320
Do you mind if I just perch
my little bottom down here?

20:25.320 --> 20:28.520
Have you been offered a small
glass of fresh orange juice

20:28.520 --> 20:30.480
and a complimentary
browse of the Daily Mail?

20:31.020 --> 20:32.280
Yes, thank you.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.400
OK, my love.

20:33.400 --> 20:37.000
Now I'm going to give you a
few facts about flight safety

20:37.000 --> 20:39.960
just to put your mind at rest,
if you'll pardon the pun?

20:39.960 --> 20:42.400
Please.

20:42.400 --> 20:46.480
Do you know how many planes
actually went down last year?

20:46.480 --> 20:48.600
I don't know.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.520
- Have a guess.
- I don't really want to think about it.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.960
- Go on.
- Five?

20:54.960 --> 20:58.040
- More than that.
- Ten?

20:58.040 --> 20:59.640
More than that.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.240
50?

21:01.240 --> 21:03.600
- A lot more than that.
- 150?

21:03.600 --> 21:05.320
- Little bit less.
- 140?

21:05.320 --> 21:07.200
122.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.720
That's all.

21:08.720 --> 21:12.200
And do you know how many
planes were lost at sea last year?

21:12.200 --> 21:13.840
I don't know.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.053
Nine.

21:15.053 --> 21:16.997
Ok, this is a fun one.

21:16.997 --> 21:18.320
No, thank you. I don't
want to do this any more.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.720
No, no, no.
This is a nice one.

21:19.720 --> 21:20.820
Do you know how many planes

21:20.830 --> 21:25.120
were accidentally shot
down in military exercises?

21:25.120 --> 21:26.700
I wouldn't want to
think about that.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.120
Four.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.160
OK? So I hope those little facts
have put your mind at rest.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.680
Happy flighting.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.880
'Ladies and gentleman if you could
just make sure your seatbelts

21:38.880 --> 21:43.280
'are fastened as we've just been
given clearance of take off.'

21:43.280 --> 21:48.160
Budget airline Flylo have
recently started selling holidays.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.960
Judith and Peter were among the first
customers to enjoy a Flylo cruise.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.160
We'd like to make a
formal complaint, please.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.920
- Excuse me, Peter.
- Sorry, Judith.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.040
We'd like to make a
formal complaint, please.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.360
We have had the
cruise from hell!

22:00.360 --> 22:01.550
- When we boarded...
- Peter!

22:01.560 --> 22:03.120
Sorry, Judith.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.720
When we boarded
the Flylo cruise liner,

22:05.720 --> 22:09.240
we were shown to our quarters
in the bowels of the ship.

22:09.240 --> 22:13.280
Only to discover that our cabin was
flooded waist-deep with seawater.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.720
But we thought, "Ho hum,
let's get on with it.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.300
"It's only our bottom halves
that are going to get wet."

22:18.520 --> 22:19.320
So we set sail...

22:19.520 --> 22:21.440
Peter, I'm talking.
It's very rude.

22:21.445 --> 22:22.440
Sorry, Judith.

22:22.440 --> 22:26.760
We set sail and we'd only just left
the port at Athens when it emerged

22:26.760 --> 22:30.880
that all 780 passengers on board the
vessel had contracted dysentery.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.520
You had to queue for 14 hours...

22:32.520 --> 22:35.560
Peter, you and I are going
to come to blows in a minute.

22:35.560 --> 22:38.560
You had to queue for 14
hours to use the lavatories.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.840
Well, we'd been waiting 13 hours
and it was very nearly our turn

22:41.840 --> 22:45.840
when we heard gunshots and discovered
the boat had been boarded by pirates.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.340
They rounded up all the
pass...

22:47.340 --> 22:49.080
Peter!

22:49.080 --> 22:53.080
They rounded up all the passengers
on deck and singled out Peter and I

22:53.080 --> 22:56.000
and took us hostage,
which meant we missed the buffet.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.160
We were then taken to a
room and told that one of us

22:59.160 --> 23:02.880
was going to have to perform sexual
acts upon the pirates at gunpoint.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.240
Well, I popped my hand in the
air and volunteered Peter,

23:06.240 --> 23:09.720
but before my husband had a chance
to engage in anything other than

23:09.720 --> 23:11.700
mild foreplay with
three of the men

23:11.720 --> 23:14.080
the boat was stormed
by the Greek coast guard.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.600
There was a shoot-out. Bodies
everywhere and just as I thought,

23:17.600 --> 23:20.040
"Surely this cruise
can't get any worse,"

23:20.040 --> 23:23.600
we discovered that the cabaret
that night was John Barrowman.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.560
That's when I broke down.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.760
It's 4 pm and although it's been
several hours since Precious

23:32.760 --> 23:36.240
was forced to close the coffee kiosk,
she's still at the airport.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.560
Oh, a very bad thing
just happened.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.200
I was playing on me Deal
Or No Deal fruit machine.

23:42.200 --> 23:46.080
You know the television show with
that nice Christian boy Noel Edmonson?

23:46.080 --> 23:47.860
Well the Devil must've
got inside Noel

23:47.880 --> 23:51.560
Cos he just thieved £180
of the petty cash from me.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.840
Well, don't worry because I'm
going to win all the money back.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.640
Have you got change
of a £10 note?

23:56.640 --> 23:58.960
Quick as you can, my love.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.840
I don't have £10,
I've only got £5.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.920
There's a place
for you in heaven.

24:03.920 --> 24:07.600
Hey! Get away from that fruit machine!
I've got my money in there!

24:07.600 --> 24:10.600
Gambling is the Devil's work.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.800
Come on, Noel.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.760
Our Lady Air cabin
crew Fearghal and Lee

24:15.800 --> 24:18.560
are working the return
flight from Dublin.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.320
Croissant or muesli?
Croissant or muesli?

24:21.320 --> 24:22.920
Croissant or muesli?

24:22.920 --> 24:25.640
Croissant or muesli?
Croissant or muesli?

24:25.640 --> 24:28.240
What happened last night
was very much a one-off.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.000
I've told Fearghal that.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.120
I think just cos you have sex
with a guy don't make you a gay.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.360
Lee certainly knows
how to please a man.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.600
It was mind-blowing. He threw me
round the room like a rag doll.

24:39.600 --> 24:44.120
It was the most intense, animalistic,
erotic encounter of my life.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.720
Hope me girlfriend
don't see this.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.240
David Schwimmer has been stopped
and searched at Customs.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.240
The Friends star was attempting
to smuggle a large number of

25:03.240 --> 25:05.400
illegal items into the country.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.800
One copy Chicks With Dicks.

25:08.800 --> 25:12.040
One copy She-male Orgy.

25:12.040 --> 25:15.600
- One copy Tranny Mania.
- Tranny Mania.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.240
One copy She-male Orgy 3.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.840
One copy Lady Boy Lick Fest.

25:21.840 --> 25:25.720
Final item - one copy
She-male Sandwich.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.680
Right. You're aware these
items are illegal in the UK.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.730
In which case would you
care to explain to me why

25:32.730 --> 25:35.760
you have attempted to
bring them into the country?

25:35.760 --> 25:38.800
Well, this is very,
very difficult for me because

25:38.800 --> 25:42.400
I don't want to
get someone else in trouble.

25:42.400 --> 25:49.240
But...they're actually
a present for a friend.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.440
- Which friend?
- Matt Le Blanc.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.120
Matt Le Blanc?

25:54.120 --> 25:56.680
That's correct.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.120
It's sad, but erm,

26:00.120 --> 26:06.640
he really can only become aroused
when watching this sort of material.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.760
Have you watched
any of these films?

26:09.920 --> 26:14.040
I have and I found it
absolutely disgusting.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.000
Which of the DVDs did
you watch, Mr Schwimmer?

26:16.140 --> 26:17.360
All of them.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.400
All of them.

26:19.400 --> 26:26.920
I was very curious as to what kind of
films Matt had asked me to buy for him.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.880
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

26:29.880 --> 26:34.560
You know the stories actually
do kind of drag you in.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.040
You know, will the
pool get cleaned?

26:38.040 --> 26:39.100
You do realise that we have

26:39.100 --> 26:40.900
no option but to
confiscate these items?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.400
Yeah, I do, I do.

26:42.400 --> 26:47.800
And actually I'm glad.
Because when Matt sees this on TV

26:47.800 --> 26:51.920
he will understand that what he asked
me to do is utterly unacceptable.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.680
In fact, can I,

26:54.680 --> 26:57.320
can I just address the
camera for a second?

26:57.320 --> 27:01.520
Matt, this is your
friend David Schwimmer.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.960
You've got a problem, buddy,

27:03.960 --> 27:06.200
and I'm...

27:06.200 --> 27:09.360
I mean you... Look,
you're sick and you need help

27:09.360 --> 27:14.320
and I will do everything within
my power to help you get help.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.040
Thank you.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.800
Thank you.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.840
Thank you all.

27:19.840 --> 27:23.560
You guys are doing an excellent,
an excellent job here

27:23.560 --> 27:26.800
- and I really appreciate it.
- Sit down, sir.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.320
They're for Jennifer Anniston.

27:32.200 --> 27:37.880
And so another eventful day at
the airport draws to a close.

27:37.880 --> 27:42.120
Captain Stirick had a strong coffee
and flew the airbus to Vienna.

27:43.960 --> 27:47.240
Omar's flatbeds scheme went
down like a cup of cold sick.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.760
And David Schwimmer was
admitted to a clinic in Arizona

27:52.760 --> 27:56.097
to treat his addiction to
transsexual pornography.
