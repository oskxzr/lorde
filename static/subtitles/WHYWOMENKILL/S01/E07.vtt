<i>Previously on</i> Why Women Kill..

00:10.343 --> 00:12.137
You can cheat on your wife
all you want,

00:12.220 --> 00:13.763
but you're not
touching mine.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.432
I am in love with you.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.225
You knew the rules.
I will never...

00:17.308 --> 00:18.560
leave my wife.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.103
So I can tell Rob is still mad

00:20.186 --> 00:21.104
about the other night.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.564
He hasn't called in days.

00:22.647 --> 00:25.734
Why would he even be with me
if he was so happy with her?

00:25.817 --> 00:27.318
<i>Maybe she did
something to hurt him</i>

00:27.402 --> 00:29.487
<i>and he needs time
to forgive her.</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:31.281
This project
I've been involved with,

00:31.364 --> 00:33.283
it's almost over.
I'll be home in time for dinner.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.242
Every night.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.327
It's Hector.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.121
He was the best hairdresser
I ever had.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.124
I've known for some time
about Karl's indiscretions.

00:41.207 --> 00:45.420
I saw his car parked
at some seedy motel.

00:47.046 --> 00:49.257
What in God's name?

00:49.340 --> 00:50.633
We haven't seen each
other in years.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.635
Hector was the only person

00:52.719 --> 00:54.596
who ever saw me
for the man I truly am.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.849
Stop romanticizing
your grubby little fling.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.267
Do you love him?

00:59.350 --> 01:00.643
I do.

01:00.727 --> 01:01.811
- Hey.
- Hmm?

01:01.895 --> 01:02.979
You fell asleep.

01:03.062 --> 01:04.439
- Take this.
- Uh...

01:04.522 --> 01:05.565
I don't think I should.

01:06.691 --> 01:07.859
<i>While I was away,</i>

01:07.942 --> 01:09.027
did you two fuck?

01:09.110 --> 01:12.030
We absolutely fucked.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.239
Okay.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.491
This was bound to happen, right?

01:14.574 --> 01:16.826
Since we're
all together now.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.495
All right, let's talk
about my script.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.872
I'm expecting offers in
the high six-figure range.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.334
Be good to Jade.
She's your muse.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.669
His muse?
I am the one who spent

01:26.753 --> 01:30.590
the last two years cleaning up
the mess he made of our lives.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.383
- What did he do?
- What didn't he do?

01:32.467 --> 01:33.885
Speed, cocaine.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.970
He's an addict.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.139
One of the producers
wants a rewrite.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.725
And if I can get it to them
on time, then... I'm back.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.311
And the money that will follow,
Jade, I can take care of you.

- Bethany.
- Oh.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.187
Thank you
for meeting me.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.356
Yeah. I was... I was
a little surprised

04:33.439 --> 04:34.524
to get your text.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.275
It's, um, it's
been a minute.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.027
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry about that.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.238
I know I kind of
disappeared there.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.699
Yeah. Thought maybe you had,
uh, found someone else.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.076
No, no, nothing like that.
I just, you know...

04:45.159 --> 04:47.078
Took a different path
for a while.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.371
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.706
All right, Tanya,

04:49.789 --> 04:51.207
listen to me.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.543
You're gonna go play
with your friends while Mommy

04:53.626 --> 04:54.711
talks to her friend, okay?

04:54.794 --> 04:56.004
- Okay.
- Oh, big girl.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.255
I see them on
the playground.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.756
You better go.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.508
Oh, my God.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.218
She's so big.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.053
- I know.
- In my head, I still think of her

05:04.137 --> 05:05.680
- as a baby.
- Yeah, well,

05:05.763 --> 05:07.598
24 months is like a
lifetime in kid-years.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.392
Yeah.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.774
Okay, so I got this
shit from Mexico.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.443
It's stepped on a little
bit, but it's good.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.111
Just, like,
15% baby laxatives.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.363
It'll definitely
get you high.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.574
But this shit

05:24.657 --> 05:27.452
just fell off the back of a
fucking boat from Colombia.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.287
Okay, all I did was
chop it up and bag it,

05:29.370 --> 05:30.788
and I swear to God, Eli,

05:30.872 --> 05:34.083
the second you open it,
your entire face goes numb.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.460
Okay, how much?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.545
Give you an eight
ball for 300?

05:37.628 --> 05:39.255
Or I can do two for five.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.757
That's the best
I can do, though.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.633
I'm trying to save for
Tanya's college fund.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.385
Well, you're a good mom.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.928
Mm.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.138
All right, I'll take two.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.890
Okay.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.437
Nice to have you back.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.489
Karl.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.117
We need to talk.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.791
Bloody hell,
it's 7:00 in the morning.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.044
I was so angry
with you last night.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.629
The way you spoke to me.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.505
Look, Simone...

06:20.588 --> 06:23.132
I was up all night
thinking to myself,

06:23.216 --> 06:26.469
"I wish I'd never
married that man.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.721
He's stolen the last
ten years of my life."

06:28.805 --> 06:30.264
All right, I'm sorry.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.683
Here, put that on.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.352
Why?

06:34.435 --> 06:35.812
Just do it.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.730
All right.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.485
Then I started thinking
about our time together.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.696
You taught me how to ski...

06:46.948 --> 06:49.325
...how to tango.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.619
Hmm. How to speak French.

06:51.702 --> 06:55.665
Asking for more chardonnay
is not really speaking French.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.875
Most importantly,

06:57.959 --> 07:00.670
you taught me how
to laugh at myself.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.842
The truth is, you haven't
stolen anything from me.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.177
If anything,

07:08.261 --> 07:09.971
you've given me more
than I deserved.

07:10.054 --> 07:14.183
I'm sorry, the suspense is
slightly killing me now.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.018
Where is this going?

07:17.061 --> 07:18.563
Follow me.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.817
Just to be clear, I still think
we should get a divorce.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.777
Uh, yes, I assumed as much.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.196
But just because I can't
have you as a husband

07:27.280 --> 07:29.073
doesn't mean I can't
have you as a friend.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.576
And I do like to
keep my friends happy.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.914
Hector.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.791
Hello, Karl.

07:41.752 --> 07:46.257
I have never loved you more
than I do in this moment.

07:46.340 --> 07:49.385
Please, Karl, not in front
of the boyfriend.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.399
Hello.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.735
Sheila.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.404
Your apartment manager told me
you were down here.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.239
- I was hoping we could get lunch.
- Ugh.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.866
Sorry, I just got
called into work.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.576
Two waitresses are sick.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.203
I have to clean my uniform
and get over to Glendale.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.455
It's fine.
We can catch up another time.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.248
Well, there's certainly
a lot to catch up on.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.709
Has something happened?

08:24.462 --> 08:25.504
Mrs. Persky...

08:27.798 --> 08:28.925
I need you to leave.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.051
Why?

08:30.134 --> 08:31.427
I need to talk
to my friend.

08:31.510 --> 08:32.720
What about?

08:32.803 --> 08:33.930
It's private.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.933
So sex, huh?

08:37.016 --> 08:39.018
Just go!

08:44.232 --> 08:46.275
You seem irritable.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.446
Rob dumped me.

08:50.529 --> 08:52.740
He did?

08:52.823 --> 08:54.742
Yeah, he sent roses
with a note

08:54.825 --> 08:58.246
saying, "I can't keep seeing
you, please forgive me."

08:58.329 --> 09:01.958
Oh, well, you knew
this day was coming.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.626
Yeah. I just thought
he would be man enough

09:03.709 --> 09:05.586
to tell me to my face.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.965
You know, I phoned him at his
work yesterday ten times.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.384
His secretary, Claire,
won't put me through.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.969
Well, honey,
it is time to move on.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.845
- You don't want to embarrass yourself.
- Well...

09:14.929 --> 09:16.722
Yeah.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.144
What are you doing back here?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.479
I brought my husband.

09:23.562 --> 09:25.147
I want him to see
how you talk to me.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.358
I should go.
I'll call you later.

09:27.441 --> 09:28.985
- Thanks.
- Sorry...

09:29.068 --> 09:32.196
Aw, why the long face?

09:32.280 --> 09:33.739
Did your fella dump you?

09:35.324 --> 09:37.660
Your wife is a horrible person.
Do you know that?

09:37.743 --> 09:40.288
Yeah, I'm aware.

09:41.622 --> 09:45.459
I thought we were excited
about the offer.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.546
No, no.

09:48.629 --> 09:51.048
Look, of-of course I trust you.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.175
Yeah. I mean,
do your thing. Okay.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.385
All right, bye.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.554
Oh, shit.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.349
Is everything all right?

10:00.433 --> 10:04.186
Hey. Uh, yes.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.522
Yeah, there's-there's an offer
on the table for the script.

10:06.605 --> 10:09.150
But Lamar wants to hold out
for more money,

10:09.233 --> 10:10.818
which, you know,
makes me kind of nervous.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.905
What are you on right now?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.200
What? Nothing.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.202
Oh, yeah? Then
what's this, then?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.163
Hmm?

10:22.246 --> 10:24.874
It-it...
it's a heavy pollen year.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.500
Dude...

10:26.584 --> 10:27.877
It's been on the news.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.378
We are on the same team.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.006
I cannot cover for you if you're
gonna be stupid about it.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.844
All right, I'm sorry.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.554
The addy wasn't cutting it
for me anymore,

10:38.637 --> 10:40.056
so I just... I needed something
a little bit stronger.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.017
Why? The script is done.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.560
Guys?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.228
Yeah, we're in here.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.772
Get your hand
out of your face.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.231
- All right.
- Sorry.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.566
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:50.649 --> 10:51.901
I need to talk to you both.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.028
- Yeah, what's on your mind?
- Look,

10:54.111 --> 10:57.031
I know I said I was okay with
what went on with you two,

10:57.114 --> 10:58.866
but clearly, I wasn't.

10:58.949 --> 11:01.202
I felt like I went away
for the night, and you two

11:01.285 --> 11:03.871
had suddenly become
this little team without me.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.082
And it's not fair
to blame you,

11:06.165 --> 11:07.708
because I'm the reason
we're all together

11:07.792 --> 11:08.584
in the first place.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.252
I just feel like
I talked you into this

11:10.336 --> 11:12.755
with absolutely no idea of
how we would make it work.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.715
Well, that's okay.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.551
- Yeah. I mean, we will figure it out.
- We will.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.303
But we're gonna need some help,
and I think I found

11:19.387 --> 11:20.596
just the place to start.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.811
"Amour the Merrier
Events, Limited"?

11:26.894 --> 11:28.062
Events?

11:28.145 --> 11:29.605
You want us to
go to an orgy?

11:29.688 --> 11:30.940
Oh, it's not an orgy.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.566
It's a polyamory retreat.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.985
Isn't that just a fancy
way of saying "orgy"?

11:35.069 --> 11:36.112
Stop saying orgy.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.780
- All right.
- This is a three-day event

11:37.863 --> 11:39.615
at a hotel in San Diego.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.992
They have workshops, lectures, all designed

11:42.076 --> 11:44.120
to help people who are new
to the polyamorous lifestyle.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.121
The whole thing is designed

11:45.204 --> 11:47.289
by experts who know how to
make a relationship

11:47.373 --> 11:49.291
like ours work.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.793
Oh, look, so here's
one of the seminars.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.586
"Negotiating Boundaries
and Polyamorous

11:52.670 --> 11:54.922
Relationship Agreements."

11:55.005 --> 11:57.633
- Doesn't that sound helpful?
- Yeah, it really does.

11:57.716 --> 11:58.968
- Um, let me... let me see.
- See?

11:59.051 --> 12:00.428
So, I'll go make
the reservations.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.805
- We'll leave tomorrow.
- All right.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.807
- Yeah, wonderful. - Yeah.
- Yep.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.144
You okay, babe?

12:08.227 --> 12:11.313
Yeah, yeah, just,
you know, allergies. Oof.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.274
It is a heavy pollen year.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.986
It was on the news.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.737
Huh.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.205
Here comes the bubbly.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.207
Pour like there's
no tomorrow.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.169
You are getting
your husband back.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.879
I'm so happy.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.589
Of course,
I feel bad for April.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.966
Why? She should've known
what was coming.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.301
This is how the movie

12:40.384 --> 12:42.553
always ends: the man
slinks back to his wife,

12:42.636 --> 12:45.097
and the whore ends up drunk
and alone.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.183
Actually,
now that I got four kids,

12:47.266 --> 12:48.809
it doesn't sound so bad.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.855
I was thinking of taking April
to a restaurant next week.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.857
You know, to cheer her up.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.692
Beth Ann, the war is over.

12:56.775 --> 13:00.196
You won. Let the enemy
limp away in defeat.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.656
April and I grew very close
these last few weeks.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.241
It's a true friendship.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.202
She thinks your name is Sheila.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.205
I admit, it's a complicated...

13:12.541 --> 13:14.376
Honey! What's wrong?

13:14.460 --> 13:15.878
April is in my driveway.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.383
Shit.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.511
What is she doing here?

13:23.594 --> 13:25.054
Why the fuck
should I know?

13:25.137 --> 13:26.305
We can't open the door.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.556
I think we're
gonna have to.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.849
I think she saw me.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.519
You have to be me.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.895
Are you crazy?

13:32.978 --> 13:34.563
Please. I'm begging.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.232
Fine.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.441
Christ on a cracker.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.609
Don't swear.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.778
And be nice.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.408
May I help you?

13:46.492 --> 13:49.370
Are you Mrs. Robert Stanton?

13:49.453 --> 13:50.412
Yes.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.581
And who might you be,
pray tell?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.250
I'm April.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.586
I'm... a-a waitress at
Jansen's Diner in Glendale.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.755
Your husband is one
of my regulars.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.257
Is he?

14:01.340 --> 14:02.925
Yes.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.718
Um...

14:04.802 --> 14:06.720
I don't mean to rush you, dear,

14:06.804 --> 14:10.432
but I have curtains to hem
and croutons in the oven.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.601
Yes, I just wanted

14:12.685 --> 14:15.229
to come by to say that I think
your husband might have left

14:15.312 --> 14:16.939
his coat at the diner.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.567
Well, mercy me.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.444
I-I'm not even sure

14:22.528 --> 14:24.113
if it's his, but...

14:24.196 --> 14:26.282
if you wouldn't mind just
telling him that I stopped by

14:26.365 --> 14:27.825
and asking him to call me.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.827
He knows your number...

14:29.910 --> 14:31.453
number?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.622
At the diner.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.708
He could just give me
a call at the diner.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.293
I'll tell him.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.836
- Bye now.
- Goodbye.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.131
I have never said "mercy me."

14:42.214 --> 14:43.841
But you do bake
your own croutons.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.343
I can't believe April
actually came to the house.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.470
Got to say,
I'm impressed.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.681
That tramp, she ain't going down
without a fight.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.100
Well, this tramp isn't either.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.729
You know what I mean.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.316
I have to leave in ten minutes,
and I have got

15:00.399 --> 15:02.359
absolutely no idea
what to wear.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.194
You're so cute,
all aflutter

15:04.278 --> 15:06.155
over your dinner
with your new beau.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.115
Is this pastel too gay?

15:08.198 --> 15:09.825
Have you ever seen
a straight pastel?

15:09.908 --> 15:12.911
Will you please put
the paper down and help me?

15:12.995 --> 15:15.122
I'm trying to find a nice
place for you to live.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.292
Oh, what about a condo
at Sanford Palms?

15:18.375 --> 15:19.793
Sanford Palms?

15:19.877 --> 15:22.713
That's only about five blocks
away from here.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.006
Well, I still want us
to have our movie nights.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.090
You wouldn't have to drive home

15:25.174 --> 15:26.508
after cocktails.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.927
Our friends are going
to despise us.

15:29.011 --> 15:29.887
Why?

15:29.970 --> 15:31.180
When people split up,

15:31.263 --> 15:34.183
they prefer venom
and fireworks,

15:34.266 --> 15:35.809
tears and accusations.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.519
So childish
and petty.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.563
- Besides, we did that last week.
- Right.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.023
I've narrowed it down
to these two.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.024
Which do you prefer?

15:42.107 --> 15:43.317
The linen.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.318
Are you sure?

15:44.401 --> 15:46.028
Why do you care
which suit?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.279
How long is it gonna be on,
really?

15:47.363 --> 15:50.574
Oi! I'm a good girl, I am.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.326
I don't let
no gentleman touch me

15:52.409 --> 15:54.495
what ain't
bought me lobster first.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.497
Oh, that's Tommy.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.831
Don't do Eliza for him.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.166
He won't understand
the reference,

15:59.249 --> 16:00.834
and he'll think
you're having a stroke.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.337
Yes. Much humor is lost
on the younger generation.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.463
Trousers!

16:06.965 --> 16:09.385
Tommy. Come in.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.719
Where's Mr. Grove?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.596
He has a date
tonight.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.348
With a guy?

16:14.431 --> 16:15.724
Yes.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.435
I've lost a husband, but
I've gained a gay sidekick.

16:18.519 --> 16:19.436
I'm glad.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.813
Because now...

16:20.896 --> 16:22.940
we don't have to hide
when we do this.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.526
Mmm.

16:25.609 --> 16:28.529
I'm feeling
something interesting.

16:28.612 --> 16:29.905
Can you blame me?

16:29.988 --> 16:33.158
Not down there... up here.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.203
Oh! Is this for me?

16:36.286 --> 16:38.414
I was saving that
for after dinner.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.665
Do you think you can wait?

16:39.748 --> 16:42.084
What a question.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.086
Of course not.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.881
It's stunning.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.384
Your taste is improving.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.760
Mm.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.595
A woman like you
deserves the best.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.932
And I-I want you to see
that I can give that to you.

16:57.015 --> 16:59.226
Tommy!

17:00.686 --> 17:01.979
He hasn't left yet?

17:02.062 --> 17:04.231
Thank God
I caught you.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.274
I need fresh eyes
on an outfit.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.443
Uh, Simone
prefers the linen,

17:07.526 --> 17:09.445
but I think the navy's
more slimming.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.654
Thoughts?

17:10.738 --> 17:12.614
Y-You're not fat.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.783
Yes. As a straight man,
I am boyishly slim.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.536
However, as a homo, I could
afford to lose a few. So...

17:17.619 --> 17:19.329
See what Tommy
gave me.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.456
Ooh.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.832
Hark at you.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.584
Diamond Jim Brady Bunch.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.335
Anyway,

17:25.419 --> 17:26.462
which one?

17:26.545 --> 17:27.671
Just pick one.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.964
Navy.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.424
Navy it is.
Thank you.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.469
I'm terribly sorry
to interrupt,

17:33.552 --> 17:34.970
but, as you know,

17:35.053 --> 17:37.431
it's very important
to get the costume right

17:37.514 --> 17:39.183
when you're coming out.

17:39.266 --> 17:42.895
We don't care if you come out,
just as long as you get out.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.313
I can always take a subtle hint,
Simone.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.315
Perhaps, one day,
you'll give me one.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.275
Oh, tell Hector you
won't sleep with him

17:48.358 --> 17:50.277
unless he does my hair
for the wedding!

17:50.360 --> 17:51.737
You got it! Goodbye!

17:54.406 --> 17:56.700
You have
a very interesting marriage.

18:01.914 --> 18:02.873
Sheila.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.833
Um, what are you doing here?

18:04.917 --> 18:07.169
Our visit was cut short
yesterday, so I just...

18:07.252 --> 18:09.338
Now's not really a good time;
I'm feeling under the weather.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.465
Do you want me to run
to the drugstore for you?

18:11.548 --> 18:12.841
Oh, no, no. I just...

18:12.925 --> 18:14.468
need a couple of aspirin.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.178
Sit. I'll get them for you.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.638
Oh, you don't
have to do that.

18:17.721 --> 18:18.806
It's no trouble.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.475
Besides,
I have some good news.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.685
Oh. That's nice.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.021
I could use some.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.773
I've found you a man.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.151
His name's Eldon Ratzinger.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.070
Eldon Ratzinger.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.905
He's my butcher. Very nice.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.865
On the short side,
but you wouldn't notice

18:36.949 --> 18:38.700
if you're wearing flats.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.035
Thanks, but...

18:40.118 --> 18:42.871
I can't meet anyone for a while.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.749
You won't forget about Rob
if you sit around pouting.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.086
Trust me, I won't be forgetting
about Rob anytime soon.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.587
You've got to get over this obsession

18:50.671 --> 18:52.714
with another woman's husband.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.760
You're going to end up
angry and sad.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.805
You are right
about that.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.726
You know,
flowers aren't the only thing

19:04.810 --> 19:05.853
that Rob left me with.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.355
What are you
talking about?

19:11.191 --> 19:12.568
I'm pregnant.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.824
Sheila,
are you hurt?

19:19.825 --> 19:21.076
Yes.

19:21.159 --> 19:23.370
- Yes, I am.
- Let me get you a bandage.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.095
Oh.

19:40.178 --> 19:41.763
Let me get that for you,
my lady.

19:41.847 --> 19:42.639
Oh.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.266
And my other lady.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.642
How chivalrous of you.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.644
Thank you.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.396
All right.

20:11.209 --> 20:13.086
You want me
to drive for a bit?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.172
Hmm?

20:17.507 --> 20:19.426
Sorry.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.303
I think I'm just nervous

20:21.386 --> 20:22.554
about the script, you know?

20:22.638 --> 20:24.765
Actually, do you guys mind if
we pull off so I can call Lamar?

20:24.848 --> 20:26.767
Will that stop you
from playing the steering wheel

20:26.850 --> 20:27.809
like a bongo drum?

20:27.893 --> 20:28.936
Almost definitely.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.103
Then by all means.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.522
Okay, great.
Here we go.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.406
Oh, great.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.539
I wonder if they
have a bathroom.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.376
Uh, we can ask
inside the mini-mart.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.336
Do you want anything?

20:54.419 --> 20:55.545
Uh, potato chips.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.381
And chocolate milk.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.216
And gummy worms,
if they have 'em.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.343
What are you, 12?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.053
I know you are, but what am I?

21:03.136 --> 21:06.181
The polyamorists
will hear about this.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.717
Fuck!

21:41.800 --> 21:43.343
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.345
Bad news, Eli!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.100
They were out of worms.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.226
No.

21:51.309 --> 21:52.769
So I got you bears.

21:52.853 --> 21:53.895
Oh.

21:53.979 --> 21:54.938
Thank you.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.314
What are you doing in the trunk?

21:56.398 --> 21:59.026
Uh, looking for my baseball cap.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.736
Ah. So, where is it?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.738
Forgot to pack it.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.197
Fuckin' Eli.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.699
All right.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.284
Let's hit the road.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.748
Darling, is there any chance
you can watch the gallery

22:12.831 --> 22:13.915
for me this morning?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.125
Where will you be?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.460
Uh, I have an
appointment.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.086
Oh.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.213
And would this appointment
involve

22:20.297 --> 22:21.798
your new boyfriend Hector?

22:21.882 --> 22:24.885
He may tag along, yes.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.471
Look at you, proud gay man.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.264
You know I'd do anything
to support you.

22:29.347 --> 22:32.893
Short of canceling
my training session at the gym.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.479
Are you sure
<i>you're</i> not a gay man?

22:37.355 --> 22:38.565
Naomi.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.734
I thought we were meeting
at the club.

22:40.817 --> 22:41.735
You never know
who's eavesdropping there.

22:41.818 --> 22:44.654
And what I have to say
is for your ears only.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.990
Mm. Hello, Naomi.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.784
My ears and I
were just leaving.

22:48.867 --> 22:49.910
Thank you.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.247
You seem upset.

22:54.331 --> 22:57.584
Remember when I told you
that Tommy was hiding something?

22:59.419 --> 23:01.296
I know his secret.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.632
You do?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.926
He's on drugs.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.260
Oh, thank God.

23:08.011 --> 23:11.598
That you finally figured it out.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.975
It's the only thing that
makes sense... the secrecy,

23:14.059 --> 23:17.104
the long hours, the lock
on his bedroom door.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.481
Not to mention
the missing money.

23:19.564 --> 23:20.690
What money?

23:20.774 --> 23:23.318
He cashed in
his savings bond.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.278
They became his
when he turned 18.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.280
And I'm not supposed
to know,

23:27.364 --> 23:29.449
but my friend
at the bank tipped me off.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.701
I ask you, Simone,

23:31.785 --> 23:34.996
what else could he have bought
that cost $10,000?

23:36.039 --> 23:37.916
He spent $10,000?

23:40.043 --> 23:41.920
I knew you'd understand.

23:42.921 --> 23:43.964
Oh.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.424
You're such a good friend.

23:47.425 --> 23:50.137
I know we've had
our squabbles.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.304
But in a crisis like this,

23:51.388 --> 23:54.266
there is no one else
I can turn to.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.852
No one?

23:56.935 --> 23:59.312
What do you think
he's doing?

23:59.396 --> 24:01.523
Heroin?

24:01.606 --> 24:02.983
This is Tommy
we're talking about.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.860
I seriously doubt
he's on heroin.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.528
What? That's a beautiful brooch.

24:06.611 --> 24:07.821
Is it new?

24:07.904 --> 24:09.948
Then again, it could be heroin.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.994
All right.

24:14.077 --> 24:16.663
- Oh, look at this place. It's cute.
- Yeah.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.000
Here we go, come on.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.084
- Oh...
- Oh, man.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.211
Why are they
stopping everyone?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.005
Who knows?

24:25.088 --> 24:27.215
Look at all these cars.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.842
Who knew polyamory
was so popular?

24:31.344 --> 24:33.638
Oh, my God.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.725
Vice President Pence
is speaking here tonight.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.560
At a polyamory seminar?

24:38.643 --> 24:39.769
- That's surprising.
- Odd choice.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.229
No.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.439
He's in a different ballroom.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.275
He's talking
to "local Republicans."

24:45.358 --> 24:47.444
- Oh...
- Ugh. Well, that's the reason for the holdup.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.571
It's extra security.

24:49.654 --> 24:53.575
Oh, security...

24:59.789 --> 25:01.082
They're opening
people's trunks.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.918
That's gonna take forever.

25:04.794 --> 25:06.922
Um...

25:11.218 --> 25:12.761
You know what, guys?

25:12.844 --> 25:16.223
- Uh, we-we, we need to turn around. Yeah.
- What?

25:16.306 --> 25:18.934
- Why?
- Uh... I-I got to, I got to pee, guys. I'm so sorry.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.602
- I just...
- No, honey, I was kidding.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.229
The hotel is just
up the street.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.563
- We'll be there in, like...
- Nope.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.732
Can't do it. Dam's
gonna burst. Here-here we go...

25:25.815 --> 25:27.651
No, honey, wait,
what are you doing? What are you doing?

25:27.734 --> 25:28.777
- Oh!
- I'm flipping a bitch.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.403
Wait... Eli, what...

25:30.487 --> 25:31.363
You can't make a U-turn here.

25:31.446 --> 25:32.489
Yeah, well, now it's turning

25:32.572 --> 25:33.740
into a bit more
of a three-point thing.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.993
- Eli...
- Eli, no!

25:37.077 --> 25:37.953
- Or four.
- Oh, my God!

25:38.036 --> 25:39.871
Eli! Stop!

25:39.955 --> 25:41.957
Oh, my God.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.750
Eli, what are you doing?

25:43.833 --> 25:46.294
They're gonna think that
we're terrorists or something.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.171
Five.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.881
See that? Smooth sailing.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.800
- Have you lost your fucking mind? Jesus...
- Smooth sailing.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.344
Eli, slow down!

25:54.427 --> 25:55.679
You're gonna get us all killed.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.138
Oh, wha... everyone,
just calm down, okay?

25:57.222 --> 25:58.682
There's a Taco Bell
a couple miles down the road.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.100
Right? We'll stop there,
it's gonna be fine.

26:00.183 --> 26:02.143
All right?
Everything is gonna be fine.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.609
What?

26:09.693 --> 26:13.488
Stop the car. Now.

26:13.571 --> 26:16.032
All right.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.792
What... Why are you
opening the trunk?

26:25.875 --> 26:27.877
Because I want to know
what's in there.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.921
Taylor!

26:33.258 --> 26:34.509
Shit.

26:34.592 --> 26:36.177
Eli, your nose.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.179
Oh...

26:38.263 --> 26:40.307
Fuck.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.766
Wait.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.859
Oh, my God. Eli.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.861
I-I know that it looks bad.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.071
Get in the car.
We're going home.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.656
W-What about the retreat?

26:56.740 --> 26:59.034
Oh, fuck the retreat.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.884
Pregnant? Jesus.

27:15.967 --> 27:19.220
She's not only a tramp,
she's a stupid tramp.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.431
- I don't want to drink right now.
- Oh, honey.

27:21.514 --> 27:24.601
This is all for me.
I find your life very stressful.

27:24.684 --> 27:28.521
At least we know why April was
so desperate to speak to Rob.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.567
How do you think he'll react?

27:33.777 --> 27:36.029
I think he will be thrilled.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.406
Really?

27:38.490 --> 27:41.910
Rob loved being a father.

27:41.993 --> 27:47.082
When we lost Emily...
that was our daughter's name...

27:47.165 --> 27:49.292
That's a beautiful name.

27:52.337 --> 27:55.090
When we lost Emily,
he couldn't accept it.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.509
Rob begged me
to have another child.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.594
Why didn't you?

27:59.677 --> 28:03.765
We tried and tried, but...

28:03.848 --> 28:06.434
Did you ever think
about adoption?

28:06.518 --> 28:08.603
Rob said he didn't want
to raise another man's baby.

28:08.686 --> 28:10.271
He wanted a child

28:10.355 --> 28:11.648
of his own.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.485
And now he's going to get one.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.904
God, I hate this guy.

28:17.987 --> 28:20.907
Ugh, please,
he's still my husband.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.620
What do I do now?

28:25.703 --> 28:28.623
Come clean.

28:28.706 --> 28:30.834
Tell him you know about
the affair, and the baby.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.795
- No.
- It's time to put it all on the table.

28:33.878 --> 28:34.963
But how will that help?

28:35.046 --> 28:36.339
It will force him

28:36.423 --> 28:37.799
to make a choice.

28:37.882 --> 28:40.802
You or her.

28:40.885 --> 28:45.181
What if... he doesn't choose me?

28:45.265 --> 28:47.809
Well, then you'll finally hate
the fucking bastard

28:47.892 --> 28:50.019
just as much as I do.

28:54.566 --> 28:58.319
No, I won't. That's the problem.

28:58.403 --> 29:02.782
Look, I don't know
what he's gonna do.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.826
Maybe he'll choose you.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.287
But whatever happens,

29:07.370 --> 29:10.081
aren't you done
with all the lies?

29:13.209 --> 29:15.670
Oh...

29:22.427 --> 29:23.970
Okay, team, let's go. Heads up!

29:24.053 --> 29:26.306
Defense, north side
of the field.

29:26.389 --> 29:29.934
Offense, south side.
Let's go...

29:34.272 --> 29:36.191
Hey. What are you doing here?

29:36.274 --> 29:38.485
Why didn't you tell me
these diamonds were real?

29:38.568 --> 29:41.321
Yea... of course they're real.
I thought you knew that.

29:41.404 --> 29:42.739
Well, I didn't. Take this back.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.240
No. Why would I do that?

29:44.324 --> 29:46.159
The bank told your mother
you sold a bond.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.369
She now thinks you're on drugs,
and knowing

29:48.453 --> 29:50.705
what you spent on this,
I'm wondering if she's right.

29:50.788 --> 29:52.207
- I'm not taking it back.
- Tommy.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.417
I should be able to buy diamonds
for the woman I love.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.922
Relax. I don't expect you
to say it back.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.382
I gave you that so you'd see
that I'm not just some kid

30:01.466 --> 30:03.009
who can't play in your league.

30:03.092 --> 30:05.386
The diamonds are real
because my feelings are.

30:06.971 --> 30:09.098
You know I adore you,

30:09.182 --> 30:12.227
but I just don't see how we can
have that kind of relationship.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.229
Because of what people
would say?

30:14.312 --> 30:16.523
- They'd be brutal.
- So, you're not embarrassed

30:16.606 --> 30:18.399
that Karl dates men,
but you are embarrassed by me?

30:18.483 --> 30:19.943
I am not embarrassed at all.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.195
Oh, dear God.

30:22.278 --> 30:25.740
Hey, Tommy!
Who's your girlfriend?

30:25.823 --> 30:27.575
I-I can't stay here.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.245
- Here, take this, please.
- No.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.915
It's yours.
I'm not ashamed to love you.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.764
- Taylor...
- Don't.

30:49.847 --> 30:52.642
I need for no one
to speak right now.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.738
How long?

31:07.323 --> 31:09.450
Sorry?

31:09.534 --> 31:12.704
How long have you
been using again?

31:13.997 --> 31:15.915
Not that long.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.917
- I mean, it started...
- Don't tell me.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.794
I don't want to know how long
I missed the signs.

31:19.877 --> 31:21.254
How long this has been happening

31:21.337 --> 31:23.339
right in front
of my own stupid face.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.133
Babe, please, you...

31:25.216 --> 31:27.135
You... shut up.

31:27.218 --> 31:30.138
I was distracted before.

31:30.221 --> 31:33.349
You'd better believe my eyes
are wide fucking open now.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.327
Hello?

31:52.410 --> 31:54.704
Tommy's dealing drugs.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.623
What?

31:56.706 --> 31:58.541
Kay Randall's son Bradley

31:58.625 --> 32:02.670
saw him today with a customer.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.339
A customer?

32:04.422 --> 32:08.217
He saw him making a deal
in the middle of P.E.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.803
with some seedy,
middle-aged woman

32:10.887 --> 32:13.640
- in dark glasses.
- Middle-aged?

32:13.723 --> 32:15.016
Anyway,

32:15.099 --> 32:17.018
do you have a screwdriver?

32:17.101 --> 32:19.145
I want to break
into Tommy's room.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.064
Why? I'm sure he doesn't keep
drugs in there.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.483
Maybe not, but at least
I could read his journal.

32:24.567 --> 32:26.486
His journal?

32:26.569 --> 32:28.655
I think I found one.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.907
W-Well, what do you mean,
he keeps a journal?

32:30.990 --> 32:32.867
I-I have to go.

32:32.950 --> 32:35.745
Naomi. Uh...

32:57.975 --> 33:00.353
- Naomi?
- Up here!

33:08.820 --> 33:11.072
Naomi.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.241
I'm so glad you're here.
You can help me look.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.035
I am only here to stop you
from making an awful mistake.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.413
If Tommy finds out
you read his journal,

33:18.496 --> 33:19.747
you could lose him forever.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.916
He won't find out.
He's at track until 6:00.

33:21.999 --> 33:23.918
You trashed his room. You won't
have time to clean it up.

33:24.001 --> 33:25.878
And the journal
may not even be here.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.922
Found it.

33:28.005 --> 33:29.424
Simone.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.092
When Amy was ten,
I read her diary.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.885
She didn't speak to me
for a year.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.930
- Hand it over.
- If she had been Tommy's age,

33:36.013 --> 33:37.724
she'd have moved out.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.976
Do you really want to risk that,
just to get an intrusive look

33:40.059 --> 33:42.979
at Tommy's most
private thoughts and...

33:43.062 --> 33:44.939
- Jesus Christ. Nothing!
- What?

33:45.022 --> 33:46.607
Give me that.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.735
As your friend, I am
begging you, don't read that.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.862
Why are you so emotional?

33:53.030 --> 33:54.699
Karl is gay.

33:56.033 --> 33:57.994
- What?
- He sleeps with men.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.371
Uh... can we just focus
on my problems for a moment?

34:00.455 --> 34:01.497
No wonder you're so distraught.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.124
I mean,
I wanted to tell you,

34:03.207 --> 34:05.626
but then I thought,
"No, Naomi has her own problems.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.837
She doesn't want to hear
my tawdry tale."

34:07.920 --> 34:09.714
Oh, but I do.

34:23.436 --> 34:24.645
<i>You mean to tell me</i>

34:24.729 --> 34:26.773
that when I saw Karl's
car at the motel,

34:26.856 --> 34:29.317
he was there with a man?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.819
I can't talk about this
without a drink.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.279
Maybe we could
go downstairs and,

34:33.362 --> 34:34.614
you know,
open up a bottle?

34:34.697 --> 34:36.324
Of course.
But how did you find out?

34:36.407 --> 34:38.326
Did you catch him with
one of his lovers?

34:38.409 --> 34:39.786
No, it was Wanda.
You were right.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.204
She despises me.

34:41.287 --> 34:42.955
- She found out...
- What are you doing in my room?

34:48.085 --> 34:49.837
Is that my journal?

34:49.921 --> 34:51.672
Uh, she just found it,

34:51.756 --> 34:53.466
but she hasn't read it yet.

34:53.549 --> 34:56.052
I'm so sorry, Tommy.

34:56.135 --> 34:58.387
I just wanted to make sure
that you weren't doing drugs.

34:58.471 --> 35:01.015
So you broke into my room?

35:01.098 --> 35:03.184
Well, you've been
so distant lately.

35:03.267 --> 35:06.020
Mrs. Grove,
if you wouldn't mind...

35:06.103 --> 35:09.482
Yes, I should go, as this
doesn't involve me at all.

35:11.984 --> 35:14.445
Jesus. Mom...

35:20.785 --> 35:22.537
You looking for these?

35:22.620 --> 35:24.997
Oh, good, you found them.
Thank you.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.207
How'd it go in there?

35:26.290 --> 35:28.000
Eh, just told Mom
that I'm gonna

35:28.084 --> 35:30.837
cash in another bond so I can
hike through Europe this summer.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.213
She felt so guilty
about breaking

35:32.296 --> 35:33.881
into my room that she agreed.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.551
You turned the situation
to your advantage.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.094
Good for you.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.891
I, uh, leave for Paris
two days after graduation.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.018
Care to join me?

35:47.019 --> 35:48.938
Are you crazy?

35:49.021 --> 35:50.648
We don't have to leave
at the same time.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.567
I'll go first,
then you take a vacation

35:52.650 --> 35:53.693
and meet me there.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.779
No one's gonna know
that we're together.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.030
Your mother's watching.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.494
That is why we
need to do this.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.538
Someone is <i>always</i>
watching us here.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.082
We will never know who we can be
as a couple until we get away

36:08.165 --> 36:09.500
from my mom, your friends,

36:09.584 --> 36:11.919
and everyone else whose
opinions you're scared of.

36:16.465 --> 36:17.967
Can I think about it?

36:19.343 --> 36:20.803
Sure.

36:45.494 --> 36:47.413
Wow.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.790
Look at this.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.792
Someone went to
a lot of trouble.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.419
Oh, not so much.

36:53.502 --> 36:56.047
I just put out a few flowers,
and the good silver,

36:56.130 --> 36:57.632
and the candlesticks
your mother bought us.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.509
Would you like a mai tai
before dinner?

37:00.593 --> 37:03.137
You made mai tais?

37:03.221 --> 37:04.764
Hold it.
Did you wreck the car?

37:04.847 --> 37:06.807
Why would you think that?

37:06.891 --> 37:09.769
You only make mai tais
before giving me bad news.

37:09.852 --> 37:11.354
- That's silly.
- Huh.

37:11.437 --> 37:12.647
Now drink your mai tai.

37:38.589 --> 37:39.840
Where do you think you're going?

37:40.883 --> 37:42.009
Upstairs.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.469
Not alone, you're not.

37:43.552 --> 37:44.637
In fact, this is what's

37:44.720 --> 37:45.972
gonna happen right now.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.974
You and I are gonna
take a tour of this house,

37:48.057 --> 37:50.059
and you're gonna show me where
you've been hiding your stash.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.355
- There's no stash. I just...
- And you know what, Eli,

37:54.438 --> 37:55.731
put all that shit down,

37:55.815 --> 37:57.858
because you have absolutely
no reason to unpack.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.444
You're going to rehab
first thing in the morning.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.363
Are you kidding? Rehab?

38:02.446 --> 38:03.531
Come on.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.658
I want your wallet.
And your phone.

38:05.741 --> 38:07.368
You are cut off.

38:07.451 --> 38:11.539
No cash, no cards,
no PayPal, no Venmo.

38:11.622 --> 38:13.457
Do you understand?

38:17.712 --> 38:19.505
You know, I understand
why you're upset,

38:19.588 --> 38:20.673
but you don't have to
humiliate me

38:20.756 --> 38:22.008
- in front of Jade, too.
- Wrong.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.926
You should be humiliated.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.053
After what we went through
last time,

38:26.137 --> 38:28.097
the idea that you would even
put us through this again...

38:29.807 --> 38:31.225
- Eli, give it to me.
- It's Lamar.

38:31.308 --> 38:32.560
- He'll leave a message.
- Just... It could be

38:32.643 --> 38:33.728
about the script.
Just...

38:33.811 --> 38:35.688
please let me
take the call.

38:35.771 --> 38:37.606
Fine.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.735
Stay where I can see you.

38:40.818 --> 38:41.777
Hey.

38:41.861 --> 38:44.905
- Yeah...
- Tay...

38:44.989 --> 38:47.616
I want to help.
Just tell me what I can do.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.868
How much?

38:48.951 --> 38:53.330
- Just... be with me.
- Yeah.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.416
Back me up. This is
gonna be really hard.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.251
But it's the only way.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.920
Hey, you got it. Of course.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.839
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

39:06.552 --> 39:07.720
What did Lamar say?

39:07.803 --> 39:11.265
He-he was able to start
a bidding war...

39:12.850 --> 39:15.227
...and he sold it for a lot more
than we expected.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.063
How much more?

39:17.146 --> 39:18.731
One-point-two.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.608
- One-point-two?
- Million.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.902
1.2 million.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.404
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

39:25.488 --> 39:26.822
Oh, my God.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.157
Oh, my God!

39:28.240 --> 39:31.452
Are you serious? Oh, my God.

39:31.535 --> 39:34.580
- Eli, congratulations.
- Oh, my God, thank you. Thank you.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.415
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

39:36.499 --> 39:37.792
Honey, this is
such great news, okay?

39:37.875 --> 39:39.585
Your career
is back again.

39:39.668 --> 39:41.921
This is all the more reason
to get you to rehab.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.925
You-you know what?

39:46.008 --> 39:47.843
I-I don't, I don't think
it's the best time for me,

39:47.927 --> 39:48.886
right now.

39:48.969 --> 39:52.765
Buddy... you don't really
have a choice here.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.477
I just sold a script
for $1.2 million.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.979
You know? I think
I got a lot of fucking choices.

39:59.063 --> 40:02.691
Eli... I am not gonna stand by
and watch you kill yourself.

40:02.775 --> 40:05.986
Oh, God.
Come on.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.863
This is not like
last time, all right?

40:07.947 --> 40:09.824
- I'm in a completely better place now.
- Eli!

40:09.907 --> 40:12.701
This is nonnegotiable.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.203
- Taylor...
- Do you know what...?

40:14.286 --> 40:16.664
You're so fucking desperate
to control me, aren't you?

40:16.747 --> 40:18.165
- I mean, it's fucking pathetic!
- Okay. No, Eli,

40:18.249 --> 40:21.293
- this is the drugs talking. You know that, right?
- No. No. No, it's not.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.004
This is me, okay? I am clear
as a fucking bell right now.

40:24.088 --> 40:27.633
And from now on...
I make my own decisions.

40:27.716 --> 40:30.845
Okay, Eli.
Well, here's one for you:

40:30.928 --> 40:35.391
either you go to rehab,
or I walk out that fucking door!

40:35.474 --> 40:37.184
- Whoa. Hold on. Hold on.
- Really?

40:37.268 --> 40:38.853
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Really? You just walk on out?

40:38.936 --> 40:42.022
- If you push me, yeah.
- Okay. Well, Taylor,

40:42.106 --> 40:44.191
you know, I really
wish you wouldn't go.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.486
But if you want to,
that's your choice.

40:49.238 --> 40:52.741
See? I would never force
you to do anything.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.996
Come on, Jade.

41:01.458 --> 41:03.169
Jade...

41:05.171 --> 41:08.883
I... I think maybe
we shouldn't go.

41:10.676 --> 41:13.929
- You what?
- Eli needs help.

41:14.013 --> 41:16.599
I think maybe the best way
to help him is to

41:16.682 --> 41:19.852
stay here and-and,
you know,

41:19.935 --> 41:22.062
just keep
an eye on him.

41:23.105 --> 41:24.607
You're choosing him.

41:24.690 --> 41:27.401
I'm choosing us.
I'm choosing all of us.

41:27.484 --> 41:31.405
Fuck you.
Fuck you both.

41:42.249 --> 41:44.043
Mmm.

41:45.502 --> 41:48.214
I can't believe
you made peach cobbler.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.925
- I know it's your favorite.
- Mmm.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.677
You must've been
cooking since noon.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.638
I didn't start
all that early.

41:55.721 --> 41:59.516
Well, thanks for this.
It was a beautiful night.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.145
You're welcome.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.733
Aw, geez.

42:07.816 --> 42:09.443
I knew it.
Something's going on.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.612
Robert?

42:11.695 --> 42:14.949
And you're calling me Robert?
Ah, this is gonna be bad, huh?

42:15.032 --> 42:17.117
We definitely need
to have a talk.

42:17.201 --> 42:18.953
Ah, boy.

42:19.036 --> 42:20.538
First...

42:20.621 --> 42:23.415
I just want to say...

42:24.917 --> 42:27.544
...I love you so much.

42:27.628 --> 42:30.422
- Mm.
- And more importantly,

42:30.506 --> 42:35.094
I love us.
And the life we've had.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.263
You're starting to scare me.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.306
I'm scared, too.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.982
What's going on?
What's wrong?

42:48.065 --> 42:50.359
Just tell me.

42:53.237 --> 42:55.614
Once I tell you...

42:57.533 --> 43:00.661
...everything is going
to be different.

43:00.744 --> 43:04.331
Oh, my God.
Are you sick?

43:10.587 --> 43:12.381
Yes.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.509
I'm sick.

43:15.592 --> 43:17.636
Baby, what's wrong?

43:19.638 --> 43:21.849
I have cancer.

43:23.934 --> 43:27.980
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

43:28.063 --> 43:30.524
Oh... oh, my God.

44:09.146 --> 44:10.939
Oh, nice flowers.

44:11.023 --> 44:13.025
Are they from Hector?

44:13.108 --> 44:15.277
How many men
do you think I'm juggling?

44:15.361 --> 44:17.571
Oh, glad one of us
is having a good day.

44:17.654 --> 44:21.742
Oh, God,
I look like a raccoon.

44:21.825 --> 44:24.745
I cannot tell you what
I've been through today.

44:25.788 --> 44:28.040
I'm guessing you'll try.

44:28.123 --> 44:29.750
You know the pin
Tommy gave me?

44:29.833 --> 44:32.628
Well, it turns out
the diamonds were real.

44:32.711 --> 44:35.089
Naomi was
furious, because

44:35.172 --> 44:38.050
he cashed in one of his
savings bonds to buy it.

44:38.133 --> 44:41.261
Anyway, she decided
he was on drugs.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.638
And that she had
to read his journal...

44:42.721 --> 44:45.057
<i>Mr. Grove. How can I help you?</i>

44:45.140 --> 44:46.558
<i>Well, I was with my friend,</i>

44:46.642 --> 44:48.602
<i>and he-he spotted
this thing on my back.</i>

44:48.685 --> 44:49.978
<i>I mean, it's probably nothing,</i>

44:50.062 --> 44:52.481
<i>but he-he suggested
I see a doctor.</i>

44:52.564 --> 44:55.609
<i>You were right to come see me.</i>

44:55.692 --> 44:59.238
I am just relieved that
Naomi didn't find out.

44:59.321 --> 45:00.447
Anyway...

45:00.531 --> 45:04.743
before I left, Tommy ran out,

45:04.827 --> 45:06.578
and said something
that I definitely need

45:06.662 --> 45:07.746
to talk to you about.

45:07.830 --> 45:10.958
Oh, dear.
Am I going to need

45:11.041 --> 45:13.669
more wine... Oh!

45:13.752 --> 45:14.962
Damn it!

45:17.256 --> 45:18.590
- Oh, is it bad? Let me see...
- No!

45:18.674 --> 45:22.636
No, no. No, no, sorry.
Um, uh, it-it's not deep.

45:22.719 --> 45:26.140
Um... Can you just
get me a Band-Aid?

45:26.223 --> 45:27.683
Of course.

45:28.725 --> 45:31.687
Uh, uh, so, uh,
what did Tommy say?

45:31.770 --> 45:34.481
Well, he's going to
Europe for the summer,

45:34.565 --> 45:36.358
and he wants me
to join him.

45:36.442 --> 45:38.485
Oh.

45:42.364 --> 45:43.490
I know it sounds crazy,

45:43.574 --> 45:46.785
but I thought it might be nice
to spend time with him...

45:46.869 --> 45:48.912
and not have to sneak around.
What do you think?

45:52.082 --> 45:54.001
You should go.

45:54.084 --> 45:57.838
Really? I mean, it's a hectic
time, with Amy's wedding,

45:57.921 --> 45:59.006
- and the gallery...
- Listen,

45:59.089 --> 46:00.048
listen.

46:00.132 --> 46:02.509
I have spent my entire life
putting off things

46:02.593 --> 46:04.720
that I thought there'd be
time for later.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.849
Open doors
don't stay open forever.

46:10.809 --> 46:14.897
So please... go.

46:16.106 --> 46:18.233
You'll be okay?

46:20.277 --> 46:22.321
I'll be delightful.

46:22.404 --> 46:25.616
I'll bet.

46:25.699 --> 46:29.703
Judging from those flowers,
Hector must be smitten.

46:29.786 --> 46:32.206
