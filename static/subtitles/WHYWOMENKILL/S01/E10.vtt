- <i>Previously on</i> Why Women Kill...
- TAYLOR: <i>She was kicked</i>

00:11.010 --> 00:13.430
out of her third home because
her foster mother accused her

00:13.513 --> 00:14.764
of trying to seduce
her husband.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.391
A week later,
that house burned down.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.143
- You did those things?
- You can't believe

00:18.226 --> 00:19.644
- a fucking word he says!
- Jade, watch out!

00:19.728 --> 00:21.229
- (tires screech)
- (car crashes)

00:21.312 --> 00:23.106
NURSE:
Before we put him out,

00:23.189 --> 00:24.399
he wrote you this note.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.443
Said it was
important.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.111
- Did you talk to him?
- DUKE: No.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.738
Taylor came to see me in jail.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.740
You really fucked me this time!

00:35.535 --> 00:37.996
Your membership to the club
has been revoked.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.748
It's because I'm ill.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.958
It was you.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.710
You seduced

00:43.793 --> 00:45.253
<i>my child.</i>

00:45.336 --> 00:47.046
<i>Do you think
that I would be satisfied</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:49.299
just getting you kicked
out of a country club?

00:49.382 --> 00:52.761
I am just getting started,
bitch.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.345
Dad always said
that you were vindictive.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.972
I am still your mother.

00:56.055 --> 00:59.100
No, from now on, you're just
some lady that I used to know.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.186
- You pulling out?
- Not yet.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.813
<i>I'm waiting for someone.</i>

01:03.897 --> 01:05.982
MARY: <i>My husband likes to
threaten me with a loaded gun</i>

01:06.065 --> 01:08.193
he keeps in his bedside drawer.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.570
BETH ANN: Our daughter
died because of me.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.947
I'm the one who's responsible.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.991
The last time I slept
with your husband

01:15.074 --> 01:16.659
<i>was the day your child died.</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:18.328
<i>While you were coming
in the front door,</i>

01:18.411 --> 01:21.164
<i>I ran around the side
of the house.</i>

01:21.247 --> 01:23.458
Did Rob know
you had not closed the gate?

01:23.541 --> 01:26.002
I called him that
night and I told him.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.337
What can I do for you?

01:27.420 --> 01:28.797
I need to buy a gun.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.419
So, what do you think?

02:49.502 --> 02:51.921
(exhales) It's impressive.
Square footage?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.423
5,000.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.757
Give or take.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.217
Four big bedrooms upstairs.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.052
Got kids?

02:58.136 --> 02:59.554
We had a little girl.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.306
Her name was Emily.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.099
Was?

03:03.182 --> 03:05.393
Could you excuse us a moment?

03:10.899 --> 03:15.111
You've got to stop telling total
strangers our daughter died.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.821
He asked me a question.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.823
It's been over a year.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.159
How are we gonna
move forward in our lives

03:21.242 --> 03:23.202
if we keep talking
about what happened?

03:23.286 --> 03:24.829
I don't even understand
what we're doing here.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.456
The house we have now is fine.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.916
It's got
too many memories.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.001
We need a fresh start.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.254
I mean, this could be
good for us.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.423
Don't you want to find a way
to be happy again?

03:35.506 --> 03:37.383
Of course I do.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.260
Well, then let me buy this
for you.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.346
If you do that,
I'll spend every day

03:41.429 --> 03:44.307
just trying to put the smile
back on your face.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.310
The one I fell in love with.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.106
I guess we could be happy here.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.192
Of course we can.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.655
Now where's that smile I love?

03:59.697 --> 04:01.240
I bought a gun yesterday.

04:02.241 --> 04:04.160
What?

04:04.243 --> 04:06.162
I'd left an appointment
at my cancer doctors,

04:06.245 --> 04:08.456
and I passed the most
adorable gun shop.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.085
And I bought this
little revolver.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.337
Why do we need a gun?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.172
There have been robberies
in the neighborhood.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.840
Mrs. Betz on the corner?

04:17.924 --> 04:20.510
Some thief smashed her
window, reached in,

04:20.593 --> 04:22.887
and took her new purse
right off her end table.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.722
- Have I met her?
- Anyway,

04:24.806 --> 04:26.224
I don't feel safe.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.518
So I got this gun, and
I'm storing it here.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.603
And I've already
put in the bullets.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.066
You're keeping the gun loaded?

04:35.149 --> 04:36.859
If someone attacks us,
I don't think

04:36.943 --> 04:40.530
we'd want to waste time
looking for bullets. Do you?

04:40.613 --> 04:42.198
This is a nice street.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.867
Nothing bad is going
to happen to us.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.995
You never know.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.211
So...

04:55.294 --> 04:56.838
what do you think?

04:56.921 --> 04:58.715
You were right
to bring us here.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.591
So many possibilities.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.051
Yes, the floor plan's good,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.053
but really,
the color of the walls...

05:04.137 --> 05:06.055
Before we go any
further, state law

05:06.139 --> 05:08.933
compels me to disclose
that a murder took place here.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.727
Someone was murdered
in this house?

05:10.810 --> 05:12.186
Was it the decorator?

05:12.270 --> 05:13.688
- Oh. (laughs)
- (door opens)

05:15.273 --> 05:16.566
Simone!

05:16.649 --> 05:18.943
- Naomi!
- (exclaims)

05:19.027 --> 05:21.529
I saw your car out front.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.740
Tell me that you are
buying this place.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.825
I live a block away.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.410
We would be neighbors.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.705
Karl, this is my friend
Naomi from the country club.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.749
You must be
the dashing new boyfriend

05:32.832 --> 05:34.250
I keep hearing about.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.626
Not <i>just</i> the boyfriend.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.546
- I've, uh, been promoted.
- Stop.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.548
You're engaged?

05:40.631 --> 05:43.051
Oh, well, now you definitely
need a bigger house.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.720
- And who's this charming young man?
- Tommy.

05:45.803 --> 05:50.433
This is my son Tommy.

05:50.516 --> 05:54.562
Tommy, this is Simone.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.773
You're pretty.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.107
- Oh.
- (laughs)

05:58.191 --> 05:59.734
Kids say the
cutest things.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.278
Oh, hands off, young man.
She's spoken for.

06:02.361 --> 06:05.281
Oh, Simone, please tell me
you'll take the house.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.785
I'd absolutely kill
to have you here.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.453
Oh, it would be fun,
wouldn't it?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.538
Being close to my best friend.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.260
(tires screeching)

06:26.344 --> 06:27.970
Simone!

06:33.601 --> 06:34.977
(engine hissing)

06:35.061 --> 06:37.105
(both panting)

06:39.232 --> 06:40.858
Are you all right?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.485
Oh, my God.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.320
What happened?

06:44.403 --> 06:45.863
(bystanders clamoring)

06:45.947 --> 06:47.865
My mother tried
to kill you.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.867
What?

06:49.951 --> 06:52.328
Oh, my God, is she alive?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.957
Tommy.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.960
Someone call a doctor!

06:59.043 --> 07:00.878
- Okay.
- And the police!

07:13.474 --> 07:16.185
So... what do you think?

07:17.937 --> 07:21.149
I mean... I love it.
I say, let's do it.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.152
- What?
- I want to buy this house.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.738
Can I talk with my husband for
a moment in private, please?

07:27.822 --> 07:30.575
Take your time.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.910
What?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.537
Dude, are you crazy?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.747
Are you cra...? Did
you not see that pool?

07:36.831 --> 07:38.374
And that kitchen is huge.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.835
Yeah, and it needs a complete
remodel. We can't afford that.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.211
D-Don't worry about
the money, all right?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.213
My career is taking off.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.340
The reviews for <i>Jenny from
Yesterday</i> are through the roo.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.718
Yeah, I know,
but even so, it's still risky.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.554
Risky? Are you hearing
yourself right now?

07:51.637 --> 07:53.556
- Do you know who you sound like?
- Who?

07:53.639 --> 07:56.058
Me... when we were talking
about having an open marriage?

07:56.142 --> 07:57.518
Okay, that's not
the same thing.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.395
No. I was...
I was nervous.

07:59.478 --> 08:01.230
I was unsure that we could make
it work, but you convinced me.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.025
And now our life is so
much more exciting for it.

08:04.108 --> 08:06.527
Now think about how much even
more exciting our life would be

08:06.611 --> 08:08.738
- with that fucking kitchen, right?
- (both laughing)

08:08.821 --> 08:10.781
Oh, sweetie,
you still have that cold?

08:10.865 --> 08:12.533
It's fine. I'm good. I'm good.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.452
Just, Taylor, trust me.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.204
Okay? Believe in me.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.123
I promise you
I will not let you down.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.459
Take it slow.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.086
- God, everything hurts.
- (sighs)

08:24.170 --> 08:25.755
Well, here's something
to ease the pain.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.382
I went by the house.
All of Jade's stuff is gone.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.093
That was fast.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.554
Yeah. Well, she knows
we're onto her.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.307
She can't just stick around,
waiting for the cops to show up.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.268
Oh, speaking of the house,

08:39.352 --> 08:41.771
I, uh, got you
a little something.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.272
A business card?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.816
Yeah. For Lamar's Realtor.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.486
If it's okay with you,
I want to sell the house.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.905
Really?

08:50.988 --> 08:52.490
Yeah, it just
feels like

08:52.573 --> 08:54.242
every wrong turn
we've made can be traced back

08:54.325 --> 08:56.118
to the moment where I talked you
into buying it.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.620
No house...
wouldn't have

08:57.703 --> 08:59.997
met Jade. No Jade, no relapse.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.334
I mean, we'd lose
a lot of stress.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.044
The mortgage payments alone.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.505
(laughs)

09:07.588 --> 09:09.924
- Look at that smile.
- (laughs)

09:10.007 --> 09:13.094
All right. So how much
downsizing are we up for?

09:13.177 --> 09:15.930
Townhouse? Condo?

09:16.013 --> 09:18.307
Fuck it. Let's just buy a field.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.850
We can pitch a tent.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.644
- Love it.
- (laughs)

09:21.727 --> 09:23.479
Tent in a field.
We'd be living the dream.

09:23.562 --> 09:27.275
And the best part about moving...
Jade won't be able to find us.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.527
Where do you think she went?

09:29.610 --> 09:31.362
I don't know.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.031
Let's just hope she's
a thousand miles away by now.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.161
Who's Duke?

09:39.245 --> 09:41.372
My grandfather.

09:41.455 --> 09:45.001
Grammy Sue gave that to him for
their first wedding anniversary.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.169
He wore it every day,
but he never wound it.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.796
He always used
to say that

09:48.879 --> 09:53.592
"When I met my Susie, it
was like time stood still."

09:53.676 --> 09:56.137
Sweet.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.180
Give you 35.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.140
Hundred?

09:59.223 --> 10:00.891
No. Dollars.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.060
It's worth much more than that.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.520
Sentimental-wise, maybe.

10:04.603 --> 10:07.523
Cash-wise, it's worth $35.

10:07.606 --> 10:09.692
- Well, I need more.
- All right.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.321
I'll throw in
an extra five for the story.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.574
And 'cause I like your... face.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.416
How about a grand?

10:25.499 --> 10:26.876
I don't like
your face that much.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.210
Okay, well, then
a couple hundred.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.004
- Honey, I told you...
- Please.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.256
You don't understand
what I've been through lately.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.508
I've lost everything,
and I just need a little...

11:19.929 --> 11:21.806
No, not at all. Ralph
just left for work.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.474
I know. I waited for him to go.

11:23.557 --> 11:24.975
I need to speak
to you privately.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.144
- What's going on?
- I've thought of a way

11:27.228 --> 11:29.313
to solve our respective
marital difficulties.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.108
You have?

11:32.191 --> 11:35.027
I've come up with a plan
on how to kill our husbands.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.989
Please invite me in.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.492
This is the sort of thing
we should discuss over coffee.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.464
That's the plan.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.466
Any thoughts?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.093
It's crazy.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.345
- We'd never get away with it.
- But we would.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.305
Think about it.
Technically speaking,

12:03.389 --> 12:05.433
we wouldn't be doing
anything illegal.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.268
How could we be sure
that Rob and Ralph

12:07.351 --> 12:08.436
would even swallow the bait?

12:08.519 --> 12:10.104
That's the beauty of the plan.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.480
It's tailor-made to fit

12:11.564 --> 12:14.066
their horribly predictable
personalities.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.988
What if someone discovers
what we've done?

12:19.071 --> 12:21.282

on telling anyone.

Do you?

12:22.533 --> 12:23.451
I don't know.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.453
Ralph deserves to die.

12:25.536 --> 12:29.206
And... after everything
Rob's put you through,

12:29.290 --> 12:31.834
he's just as bad.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.961
But the Bible says,

12:34.044 --> 12:36.338
"Thou shalt not kill."

12:37.298 --> 12:39.258
God might not understand.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.801
Maybe not.

But I'm sure God's wife will.

I'm going to the farmers market.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.078
Wearing that?

22:51.161 --> 22:52.746
Well, just because
I have to shop with the frumps

22:52.829 --> 22:54.623
doesn't mean I have
to dress like them.

22:54.706 --> 22:55.916
Can I get you anything?

22:55.999 --> 22:59.795
Oh, yes, actually,
um, I could use

22:59.878 --> 23:01.797
a hundred sleeping pills
to replace the ones

23:01.880 --> 23:03.757
you took out of my dresser.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.759
You noticed.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.177
That was fast.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.137
Yes, last year you
were angry with me

23:09.221 --> 23:11.431
because I didn't take
enough pills to kill myself,

23:11.515 --> 23:13.475
and now you won't
let me have any.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.186
You need to choose a policy
and stick to it, my girl.

23:16.269 --> 23:19.815
We have to fight this disease.
We can't give into it.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.109
Have you really forgotten
how bad my last bout

23:22.192 --> 23:23.693
of pneumonia was?

23:23.777 --> 23:27.197
I wasn't sure I was
leaving the hospital.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.782
But you did,
and now you're fine.

23:28.865 --> 23:32.619
Darling, I'm not fine.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.039
If my T cells were people,

23:36.123 --> 23:37.666
I couldn't get up a bridge game,

23:37.749 --> 23:42.045
so please, <i>please</i>
give me the pills back.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.173
I already washed them
down the sink.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.383
Well, then, you'll just force me

23:46.466 --> 23:48.009
to do something more gruesome.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.846
So, hang myself
or blow my brains out.

23:50.929 --> 23:51.847
You choose.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.641
So help me, if you do
anything disfiguring,

23:54.724 --> 23:56.351
I will give you an
open-casket funeral

23:56.434 --> 23:59.146
with no makeup and
fluorescent lighting.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.858
Dear God,

24:02.941 --> 24:06.069
I married the devil herself.

24:08.321 --> 24:12.367
Oh, I know we won't be
together always,

24:12.450 --> 24:16.121
but why subtract even a day
we could share?

24:20.959 --> 24:24.379
Fine. Fine.

24:24.462 --> 24:25.755
You win.

24:29.134 --> 24:32.053
Actually, um, I'm going
to a birthday party

24:32.137 --> 24:33.221
this afternoon.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.264
Maybe you'd like to join me.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.765
- It's for Jimmy Loftus.
- (gasps)

24:35.849 --> 24:37.767
Oh, I'd love to see him again.
He's always a hoot.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.227
How is he doing?

24:39.311 --> 24:41.021
Well, I'm afraid he's
had a bit of a setback.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.230
He's in the hospital.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.940
Oh, no.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.400
Yes, the party's
in his room.

24:45.483 --> 24:48.778
If you come, I'm sure it
would lift his spirits.

24:48.862 --> 24:51.114
Oh, I'd love to come.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.576
I'm so glad.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.875
ELI:
Oh, thank God.

25:04.669 --> 25:05.587
- All right.
- Honey...

25:05.670 --> 25:08.340
Come here, you.

25:08.423 --> 25:09.299
Mmm.

25:09.382 --> 25:10.759
- Ow. Ooh, my ribs.
- Oh.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.093
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no. No, no.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.762
Don't stop, don't stop.
I can take it.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.722
(laughs)

25:20.018 --> 25:22.020
(panting)

25:25.523 --> 25:27.150
I thought you said Jade
took the dog when she left.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.110
She did.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.112
(clattering)

25:36.368 --> 25:37.744
Hey.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.955
(quietly):
Hey.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.791
- What are you doing here?
- I'm making dinner.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.751
Oh.

25:44.834 --> 25:48.255
Okay.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.131
I think you need to leave.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.759
I know things got a little funky
for a minute there,

25:52.842 --> 25:54.302
but there's no reason
that we can't go back

25:54.386 --> 25:55.762
to the way we were before.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.514
Oh, I think there are
a lot of reasons.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.641
- Yeah, Jade, please...
- Her name's not Jade.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.017
Who cares?

26:01.101 --> 26:02.936
Am I not allowed
to reinvent myself?

26:03.019 --> 26:04.062
I mean, fuck.

26:05.897 --> 26:09.317
Okay, you know what,
let's just all settle down.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.654
You guys act like
everything that happened

26:12.737 --> 26:14.322
is my fault; it's not.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.657
I could have gone
to Europe,

26:15.740 --> 26:17.659
but you begged me
to stay.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.786
You pretended to love me,

26:19.869 --> 26:24.499
and you promised that you would
always take care of me.

26:24.582 --> 26:27.002
(voice breaking):
It's not fair.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.629
You're right.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.798
You're right,
it's not fair.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.301
Okay, just stop.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.344
I don't believe
one thing about you.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.513
Least of all your tears.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.348
I didn't pretend
to love you, I <i>did.</i>

26:40.432 --> 26:42.517
But that's because I didn't know
who you really are.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.185
You tried to trick us.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.354
You played us, and you lost.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.814
It's done.

26:47.897 --> 26:49.441
Now get out.

26:51.735 --> 26:54.904
I'll go...

26:54.988 --> 26:56.614
but you have to pay me first.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.700
You think you can shake us down?

26:58.783 --> 26:59.826
- Honey.
- It costs money

26:59.909 --> 27:01.202
to start over.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.704
We're not aiding
and abetting a criminal.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.997
You owe me.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.708
Eli sold our script
for a million dollars.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.501
Give me ten grand, and I'll go.

27:08.585 --> 27:12.005
I'm not gonna pay you to leave.
I'm just gonna call the cops.

27:16.426 --> 27:17.927
All right, you know what,
let's just hold on a second.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.721
Okay? You know what
I'm gonna do?

27:19.804 --> 27:21.389
I'm gonna go talk to her.
We're gonna work this out.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.932
I mean, after all,
you've been through a lot,

27:23.016 --> 27:24.392
but you're not a bad person.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.727
Right? No, no, okay.

27:25.810 --> 27:26.936
(whispers harshly):
How could you leave me alone

27:27.020 --> 27:27.937
with that psychopath?

27:28.021 --> 27:29.397
I can't find my fucking phone.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.399
Where is it?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.193
(smoke alarm beeping)

27:33.276 --> 27:34.527
Smoke alarm.

27:34.611 --> 27:37.447
She's burning down
the goddamn house.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.995
(sighs)

27:45.663 --> 27:49.084
Hey.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.339
So what, exactly,
is Jimmy's prognosis?

27:54.422 --> 27:56.257
Well, whatever it is,
this is a party,

27:56.341 --> 27:57.759
so please try to smile.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.553
Darling, I can smile
through anything.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.392
Karl, Simone, you made it.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.727
Hello, hello.
Oh, let us through,

28:07.811 --> 28:09.062
we want to see
the birthday boy.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.147
(monitor beeping steadily)

28:15.568 --> 28:17.487
KEN:
Jimmy, look who's here.

28:17.570 --> 28:18.822
It's Karl and Simone.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.782
Happy birthday, Jimmy.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.118
And you should see
what Simone is wearing.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.577
I think it's Lagerfeld.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.621
Uh, Karl, Simone,

28:26.704 --> 28:29.624
I wanted you to meet Jimmy's mom
and his sister Terry.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.626
They just got in
from Iowa.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.503
It is so lovely
to meet you both.

28:33.586 --> 28:34.671
I can't tell you how
comforting it's been

28:34.754 --> 28:36.423
to find Jimmy here
surrounded by

28:36.506 --> 28:38.133
such loving friends.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.676
KEN: Oh, you ain't seen nothing
yet, honey.

28:39.759 --> 28:41.803
I made my famous
carrot cake.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.638
You are having
a piece, Mr. Jim,

28:43.721 --> 28:47.684
even if they have to puree it
and drip it into your arm.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.020
Can he hear us?

28:51.104 --> 28:52.772
Of course he can.

28:52.856 --> 28:56.192
Everyone's here now.
Time to sing.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.820
Here we go.

28:58.903 --> 29:02.866
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

29:02.949 --> 29:06.786

29:39.694 --> 29:43.948
I don't understand how
he got so sick so quickly.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.367
This is the disease.

29:47.994 --> 29:51.372
I've watched it happen
to Clive, to Harry,

29:51.456 --> 29:53.541
to Alistair...

29:53.625 --> 29:56.503
It's just horrifying.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.380
You know, Jimmy
once told me

29:59.464 --> 30:01.925
he was scared of
ending up like this.

30:03.259 --> 30:07.305
Connected to tubes,
wasting away.

30:09.807 --> 30:13.811
- But here he is.
- (gasps weakly)

30:15.980 --> 30:17.440
You know what
I'm driving at.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.234
You're not that sick.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.277
Yet.

30:23.696 --> 30:26.324
But we've seen my future.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.080
I would rather choose life,

30:32.163 --> 30:36.167
but life is...

30:37.335 --> 30:39.337
...off the table.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.216
The only thing
I can choose

30:43.299 --> 30:47.095
is when to die and...

30:47.178 --> 30:49.556
how.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.225
I brought you here today

30:52.308 --> 30:54.811
because I needed
you to understand.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.774
Do you?

30:59.857 --> 31:02.318
(sobs)

31:11.995 --> 31:14.455
Thank you.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.762
Rob.

31:29.846 --> 31:30.763
You're home.

31:30.847 --> 31:34.058
And starving.
Is dinner ready?

31:34.142 --> 31:35.810
The day got away from me.

31:35.893 --> 31:38.313
I had to order Chinese takeout.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.523
But it's Thursday.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.817
I was looking forward
to meatloaf.

31:42.900 --> 31:45.820
If it helps, I made you
a shaker of martinis.

31:45.903 --> 31:47.947
You could have a few
while we wait.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.325
Now you're talkin'.

31:50.408 --> 31:53.286
Thanks.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.177
Hi.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.678
Are you Taylor Harding?

32:10.762 --> 32:13.514
Yeah. Wow, you got here fast.
Come on in.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.558
Eli, the police are here.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.518
Already?

32:18.895 --> 32:21.314
I'm sorry, were you
expecting us?

32:21.397 --> 32:23.316
Yeah, we reported
a break-in.

32:23.399 --> 32:24.525
That was, like,
ten minutes ago.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.694
We're not here about
any break-in.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.197
We came to talk about
Duke Riley.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.407
What about Duke?

32:31.491 --> 32:32.742
You filed a police report
six weeks ago

32:32.825 --> 32:34.077
accusing him of assault.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.537
- Yes.
- And then four days ago,

32:36.621 --> 32:37.705
you posted his bail.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.041
I did. Why are you asking?

32:40.124 --> 32:41.668
Duke Riley was murdered
yesterday.

32:41.751 --> 32:44.712
His landlord found his body
in his apartment.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.382
He had been repeatedly stabbed.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.010
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

32:52.595 --> 32:55.264
I think we do.

32:58.267 --> 33:01.688
Whoa, this'll be
my third one.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.523
Oh, who's counting?

33:05.692 --> 33:08.236
Mrs. Stanton, are you trying
to get me drunk?

33:08.319 --> 33:11.072
I just wanted you
to be relaxed

33:11.155 --> 33:13.032
so we could have
a little chat.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.118
About what?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.871
About the day our daughter died.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.423
This will do it?

33:28.506 --> 33:31.926
Yes, just the one dose.

33:32.009 --> 33:36.264
And you won't feel any pain,
you'll just... sleep?

33:36.347 --> 33:38.349
So I'm told.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.602
Are you sure you don't
want Hector here?

33:41.686 --> 33:45.064
No, no. We've, um,
we've said our goodbyes.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.066
I-I mean,
he wanted to be here, but...

33:47.150 --> 33:48.818
well, he's so bloody emotional.

33:48.901 --> 33:52.238
The mere mention of my death, he
starts wailing like a car alarm.

33:52.321 --> 33:56.033
Be nice. He loves you.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.786
I know.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.955
But to be honest, uh,

34:01.038 --> 34:03.750
I just wanted it
to be the two of us.

34:03.833 --> 34:07.754
You deserve to have
more than just me.

34:07.837 --> 34:11.674
You should have a huge, glorious
party to send you off.

34:11.758 --> 34:16.596
You are a glorious party,
all by yourself.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.016
I knew that the first moment

34:20.099 --> 34:22.518
I laid eyes on you.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.651
You'll always be
the love of my life.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.824
So, what happens now?

34:36.908 --> 34:39.827
Well, uh, firstly, I...

34:39.911 --> 34:42.538
I'd like you to change
into the red gown

34:42.622 --> 34:44.540
I bought you in Venice.

34:44.624 --> 34:47.001
(scoffs)
What's wrong with this one?

34:48.127 --> 34:49.587
I prefer the red.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.507
All right.

34:52.590 --> 34:56.969
But this is the last time
I'll let you edit my wardrobe.

34:57.053 --> 35:00.890
When you've changed,
come down to the living room.

35:00.973 --> 35:03.017
I have a nice surprise for you.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.481
I don't want
to talk about Emily.

35:08.564 --> 35:12.235
Well, I do. I've been thinking
about that day a lot lately.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.945
And I've remembered something.

35:14.028 --> 35:15.363
What's that?

35:15.446 --> 35:18.741
I absolutely locked the gate

35:18.825 --> 35:21.077
after I brought in
the trash can.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.246
Huh.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.498
Well, you must not have.

35:25.581 --> 35:28.292
How else did Emily
get out into the street?

35:28.376 --> 35:32.380
Perhaps you could come up
with another explanation.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.090
Think.

35:37.510 --> 35:38.970
I'm not feeling well.

35:40.304 --> 35:42.223
My darling.

35:42.306 --> 35:47.687
You can't possibly imagine how
important this moment is to me.

35:47.770 --> 35:50.773
Please.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.902
Did anything happen that day
you haven't told me?

36:07.790 --> 36:10.918
No.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.006
Thank you.

36:15.089 --> 36:17.091
For what?

36:17.174 --> 36:20.928
You've made this all
so much easier.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.930
Well, she's obviously dangerous.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.724
You might want to think
about staying someplace

36:24.807 --> 36:26.434
for a few days
until we locate her.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.394
We'll check into
a hotel tonight.

36:28.477 --> 36:31.063
FEMALE DETECTIVE: And we'll put a car
on the street outside until you leave.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.648
Don't worry.
She won't get past us.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.442
- Good night.
- TAYLOR: Night.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.486
(exhales)

36:37.570 --> 36:38.779
Okay, I was trying to be cool
in front of the detectives,

36:38.863 --> 36:40.781
but oh, my God,
Jade killed Duke.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.783
- I know. I know.
- Wait, do you think she's actually gonna come back here?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.744
TAYLOR: We can't stick around
long enough to find out.

36:44.827 --> 36:46.579
- What about the dog?
- We'll take it with us.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.623
You feed her first,
I'll go start packing.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.124
- Okay. All right. Come on, Teacup.
- Okay.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.484
Mary, I'm home.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.569
(sighs)

37:18.653 --> 37:20.571
Bring me a beer!

37:20.655 --> 37:23.324
And I want it
in a mug this time.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.749
Mary?

37:34.043 --> 37:36.045
Mary?

37:43.052 --> 37:46.514
MARY: <i>Dearest Ralph.
I haven't been happy for quite some time.</i>

37:46.597 --> 37:49.141
<i>But that's not why
I've decided to leave you.</i>

37:49.225 --> 37:52.979
<i>I've met someone else.
A man who makes me happy.</i>

37:53.062 --> 37:55.356
<i>So I'm leaving you
for Rob Stanton.</i>

37:55.439 --> 37:57.858
<i>He loves me in a way
you never could.</i>

37:57.942 --> 38:00.361
<i>Your ex-wife, Mary.</i>

38:08.786 --> 38:10.746
- (quietly): Shit.
- (drawer shuts)

38:25.636 --> 38:27.638
(gun clicks)

38:39.150 --> 38:41.652
(footsteps receeding)

38:48.993 --> 38:51.912
(rings)

38:51.996 --> 38:54.457
Aren't you gonna get that?

38:54.540 --> 38:56.959
Must have been a wrong number.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.130
Well, when's the Chinese food
getting here? I'm hungry.

39:01.213 --> 39:03.799
I'm sure it'll arrive
any second.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.926
(pounding on door)

39:06.010 --> 39:07.219
See?

39:08.471 --> 39:10.222
Wait.

39:10.306 --> 39:13.017
Are you sure that's the delivery
guy? He sounds angry.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.937
Who else could it be?

39:29.867 --> 39:32.119
You are so beautiful.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.497
Look who's talking.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.627
Are you ready?

39:42.046 --> 39:45.424
Not just yet.

39:45.508 --> 39:46.926
Have you changed your mind?

39:47.009 --> 39:49.136
No. No.

39:49.220 --> 39:53.849
But I would love
just one more dance.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.977
A tango?

39:57.061 --> 39:59.063
What else?

40:01.524 --> 40:03.150
ELI: Babe, what should I pack?

40:03.234 --> 40:05.319
Just the essentials.

40:08.405 --> 40:10.574
How is this essential?

40:10.658 --> 40:11.659
Look, just 'cause
we're going into hiding

40:11.742 --> 40:12.660
doesn't mean we can't look good.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.120
Hey, have you seen my laptop?

40:14.203 --> 40:15.871
I think it's downstairs.
Check the dining room table.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.456
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- All right.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.833
So it's true.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.501
What are you doing here?

40:20.584 --> 40:22.670
I won't be here long.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.046
I just want to know why.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.173
Now is not a good time.
You have to go.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.550
What the hell?

40:27.633 --> 40:28.551
I'm sorry, Rob.

40:28.634 --> 40:32.346
Uh... honey, this is...

40:32.429 --> 40:34.515
Don't bother lying. She knows
that we were having an affair.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.016
- What?
- BETH ANN: Please.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.144
- You have to go!
- You know how I always talk to you

40:38.227 --> 40:39.812
about my friend Sheila?

40:39.895 --> 40:41.105
This is Sheila.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.191
(groans)

40:44.275 --> 40:46.652
Uh, okay...

40:46.735 --> 40:50.197
I came to the diner that day
to confront you.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.409
But you were so nice. And you
said we could be friends.

40:53.492 --> 40:54.660
Hold on.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.328
You're friends with my mistress?

40:56.412 --> 40:57.663
Fiancée.

40:57.746 --> 40:59.248
Can we talk about this later?

40:59.331 --> 41:00.541
What could you have
been thinking?

41:00.624 --> 41:02.585
Oh, you're a fine one to talk.

41:02.668 --> 41:04.503
You've been having
an affair for months.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.172
You've been planning
on leaving me.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.674
Oh, my God.
Do you even have cancer?

41:08.757 --> 41:10.926
Cancer? You have cancer?

41:12.136 --> 41:13.596
Well, this is just awkward.

48:40.208 --> 48:41.376
Hi there.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.170
You must be Beth Ann?

48:43.253 --> 48:44.838
You must be Simone.
Come in.

48:44.921 --> 48:48.008
- It's nice to finally meet you.
- Likewise.

48:48.091 --> 48:50.177
I have the keys
around here somewhere.

48:50.260 --> 48:52.012
Let me look.

48:52.095 --> 48:53.847
One of the reasons
I wanted to meet

48:53.930 --> 48:56.016
was because I had a question.

48:56.099 --> 48:57.392
It's a bit awkward.

48:57.476 --> 48:59.019
What would you like to know?

48:59.102 --> 49:00.437
The realtor told me

49:00.520 --> 49:02.856
that someone was murdered
in this house?

49:02.939 --> 49:04.858
It's true.
My husband was killed...

49:04.942 --> 49:06.026
right where you're standing.

49:06.109 --> 49:08.028
- Oh, dear.
- Our neighbor broke in

49:08.111 --> 49:09.738
and accused Rob of
sleeping with his wife.

49:09.821 --> 49:11.323
Shot him dead.

49:11.406 --> 49:13.492
He was executed last year.
So sad.

49:15.160 --> 49:17.245
Aunt Beth, I'm packed.
Can we go?

49:17.329 --> 49:19.331
In a sec.
Elsie, this is Simone,

49:19.414 --> 49:21.333
- the woman who bought our house.
- Hi, there.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.710
You're so pretty.
She's your niece?

49:23.794 --> 49:26.171
The daughter of my friend,
April Warner.

49:26.254 --> 49:28.674
But I've been helping take care
of her since she was a baby.

49:28.757 --> 49:30.509
April is a singer, you know.

49:30.592 --> 49:32.052
My mom's gonna be on Broadway.

49:32.135 --> 49:34.179
That's why we sold the house.
We're moving to New York.

49:34.262 --> 49:35.430
Oh, how exciting.

49:35.514 --> 49:36.890
Here are your keys.

49:36.973 --> 49:40.936
I hope to have a very
happy life in this house.

49:41.019 --> 49:43.063
A happy life
isn't hard to come by.

49:43.146 --> 49:46.650
The trick is
to not regret the choices

49:46.733 --> 49:49.403
you made along the way.

49:49.486 --> 49:51.363
Yes.

49:51.446 --> 49:53.365
Well...

49:53.448 --> 49:55.242
good luck with everything.

49:55.325 --> 49:57.786
Likewise.
Take care of my house.

49:58.995 --> 50:00.956
I'll give it lots of love.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.251
There you go.

50:04.334 --> 50:07.087
Thank you.

50:07.170 --> 50:08.922
I just know that we're
gonna love living here.

50:09.005 --> 50:10.590
I certainly hope so.

50:10.674 --> 50:12.467
So when did you
buy the house?

50:12.551 --> 50:14.136
'74.

50:14.219 --> 50:17.013
But after my husband died,
I rented the house out.

50:17.097 --> 50:20.767
Then it was the headquarters
for my foundation.

50:20.851 --> 50:23.061
I raise money for AIDS research.

50:23.145 --> 50:24.438
Yeah, we've read up on you.

50:24.521 --> 50:25.981
You've done such
amazing work.

50:26.064 --> 50:28.608
I ended up living
a very rich life,

50:28.692 --> 50:30.777
once I stopped worrying
about money.

50:32.362 --> 50:34.322
Paulo, I'm ready.

50:35.824 --> 50:37.284
Is that a Thomas J. Harte?

50:37.367 --> 50:40.287
- Oh, you know his work?
- TAYLOR: Sure.

50:40.370 --> 50:42.581
- Yeah, we saw a show of his at the Whitney last year.
- That's right, yeah.

50:42.664 --> 50:45.751
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

50:45.834 --> 50:47.836
I always hoped Tommy
would go far.

50:47.919 --> 50:51.590
Tommy?
Is he a friend of yours?

50:51.673 --> 50:55.635
A friend?
You could say that.

50:55.719 --> 50:58.889
My face is tattooed on his ass.

51:00.891 --> 51:03.477
Paulo, push.

51:08.023 --> 51:10.984
(sighs) Well, it's been
lovely to meet you, Taylor.

51:11.067 --> 51:12.694
And just know that
Andrew and I will

51:12.778 --> 51:14.780
take wonderful care
of your home.

51:14.863 --> 51:17.115
Aw, well, I hope
you'll enjoy it.

51:17.199 --> 51:19.159
We will.

51:19.242 --> 51:23.038
And I'm sorry for everything
that happened to you here.

51:23.121 --> 51:25.791
Can't imagine what
you went through.

51:25.874 --> 51:27.959
It was an awful night.

51:28.043 --> 51:29.461
But it could have been worse.

51:29.544 --> 51:31.838
So you really have
a rifle collection?

51:31.922 --> 51:34.174
Yeah. They're all
in that box over there.

51:34.257 --> 51:36.718
Hey, check this out.

51:36.802 --> 51:39.721
This is me on safari
in Africa.

51:39.805 --> 51:42.015
- Look at that.
- No way.

51:42.098 --> 51:44.518
Well, I-I never knew there were
Jews that were into hunting.

51:44.601 --> 51:46.853
We exist. But it's not
as cruel to the animals,

51:46.937 --> 51:48.563
because we miss so frequently.

51:50.148 --> 51:52.984
TAYLOR:
Oh, before I forget,

51:53.068 --> 51:54.486
here are your keys.

51:54.569 --> 51:57.239
Thank you.

51:57.322 --> 51:58.657
So, what about
the two of you?

51:58.740 --> 52:00.033
Found a new place to live?

52:00.116 --> 52:01.660
- Uh, yeah. Well, actually...
- (phone buzzing)

52:01.743 --> 52:04.037
...we're moving back
to our old condo.

52:04.120 --> 52:06.915
After living in a mansion.
That is some serious downsizing.

52:06.998 --> 52:09.709
Yeah. For us, it turns out...

52:09.793 --> 52:11.837
Less is more.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.213
Well, best of luck
to both of you.

52:13.296 --> 52:15.090
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

52:18.677 --> 52:20.220
They seem like nice people.

52:27.811 --> 52:29.563
Are you gonna miss the house?

52:29.646 --> 52:32.357
It's just a building.

52:32.440 --> 52:34.526
Home is where my family is.

52:53.712 --> 52:56.423
Back to the hotel?

52:56.506 --> 53:00.510
Yes. I'm ready
for my massage now.

53:02.470 --> 53:05.348
(chuckles)

53:15.358 --> 53:17.777
All right.
Condo, here we come.

53:17.861 --> 53:21.615
It's gonna be nice.
Just the three of us.

53:21.698 --> 53:24.159
(barks)

53:32.709 --> 53:33.877
Honey?

53:36.671 --> 53:38.673
(gunshot)

53:44.140 --> 53:49.140
