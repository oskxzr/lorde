00:09.217 --> 00:10.927
<i>Previously on</i> Why Women Kill..

00:11.010 --> 00:12.679
They pumped my stomach.

00:12.762 --> 00:14.139
I'm not paying for that.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.932
Not when a good burp
would've saved you.

00:16.015 --> 00:16.933
<i>I've known for some time</i>

00:17.016 --> 00:18.601
about Karl's indiscretions.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.770
I was picking up
my dry cleaning,

00:20.854 --> 00:23.231
and there was his car,
parked across the street

00:23.314 --> 00:24.983
at some seedy motel.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.151
You still want
to make love to me?

00:26.234 --> 00:27.861
- Yeah.
- I'm free today at 4:00.

00:27.944 --> 00:28.820
Where should we go?

00:28.903 --> 00:31.072
You're a man now;
figure it out.

00:33.324 --> 00:36.035
There's no way I'm getting
into your mobile sex den.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.498
You seem, uh... energized.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.958
Do I?

00:42.041 --> 00:44.210
Have you embarked on
a new exercise regimen?

00:44.294 --> 00:48.131
I plan on working out
as often as I can.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.007
<i>The other day,
she was going on and on</i>

00:49.090 --> 00:50.133
<i>about how much
she liked my movie.</i>

00:50.216 --> 00:52.594
You know what? We've already
got an open marriage...

00:52.677 --> 00:54.053
I'll ask her for a three-way.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.638
If she says no...

00:55.722 --> 00:57.974
She says yes.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.476
Oh, my God.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.810
<i>You in love with her?</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:02.604
<i>You've been insecure lately</i>

01:02.687 --> 01:04.481
- because of your career.
- Are you in love with her?

01:04.564 --> 01:05.607
No.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.150
<i>Has your married man</i>

01:07.233 --> 01:08.526
<i>ever told you</i>

01:08.610 --> 01:09.861
why he feels the need to cheat?

01:09.944 --> 01:11.529
He was bored with his wife.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.490
It's a manual.
For married couples.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.657
These are dirty pictures.

01:14.741 --> 01:15.784
They're scientific.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.869
I have to concentrate.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.040
Ow, ow, ow!

01:23.750 --> 01:25.126
Rob, please don't go.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.337
This has been
an awkward night.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.130
I need to make an appearance.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.132
They must be important clients.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.467
Don't wait up.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.588
It begins quite slowly.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.381
With a look.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.216
Or a gesture.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.635
And once the invitation
is accepted...

02:58.678 --> 03:00.597
The tango begins.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.770
It is a dance of anticipation.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.149
- Seduction.
- Desire.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.194
And love.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.414
You know, some say
it takes two to tango.

03:26.497 --> 03:30.793
But sometimes,
lurking in the dark...

03:30.877 --> 03:32.670
Is a third.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.976
Now, if you choose
to dance with him,

03:47.060 --> 03:49.646
be prepared to deal
with the consequences.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.316
For passion can
turn to jealousy.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.027
Love can become violent.

04:04.243 --> 04:07.830
Yes. The tango exists
to remind us

04:07.914 --> 04:10.500
the greatest love stories...

04:10.583 --> 04:14.337
End in death.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.348
Just a reminder,

04:25.431 --> 04:27.642
I've got that project
due tomorrow.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.686
So you'll be working late again?

04:29.769 --> 04:30.979
Afraid so.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.731
Sorry, honey.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.567
What are your big
plans for the day?

04:36.651 --> 04:39.320
Oh, nothing interesting.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.073
Need to drop by
the dry cleaners.

04:42.156 --> 04:45.952
After that, I'll go
to the market for some shopping.

04:46.035 --> 04:49.038
And then I might have lunch
with a new friend.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.336
This is your phone number.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.671
Oh, I thought
you should have it,

04:56.754 --> 04:58.006
now that we're getting
to be chums.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.008
This way,
if you ever need someone

05:00.091 --> 05:01.342
to go with you to the movies...

05:01.426 --> 05:03.177
I can call you up. Got it.

05:03.261 --> 05:07.056
Now, I rent a room
from a lovely couple.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.725
The wife's name

05:08.808 --> 05:10.059
is also Sheila.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.394
- Oh.
- So,

05:11.477 --> 05:13.271
if you call and she answers...

05:13.354 --> 05:15.064
Then I'll ask
for the other Sheila.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.025
Exactly. Busy this week?

05:17.108 --> 05:20.611
Uh, my schedule is pretty open,
except for tonight.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.740
I have a date.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.409
With your married man?

05:26.492 --> 05:28.703
He finished some big project
at work. To celebrate,

05:28.786 --> 05:32.415
he got us reservations
at this really fancy night club.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.084
He's taking you out?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.919
In public?

05:37.003 --> 05:40.256
For the first time.
It's like an actual boyfriend.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.801
Isn't that nice?

05:48.347 --> 05:49.640
What are you smiling about?

05:49.724 --> 05:51.142
Oh, the absurdity of it all.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.894
I'm having the best sex
of my life

05:52.977 --> 05:55.563
in the back of a catering van.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.275
Well, maybe when Mr. Grove
moves out,

05:59.358 --> 06:02.320
we could start
doing this in your bed.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.946
Yes...

06:04.030 --> 06:05.948
So, about that...

06:06.032 --> 06:11.037
Karl may be staying in my home
longer than we discussed.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.293
How much longer? A week?

06:17.376 --> 06:19.128
Longer.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.130
Two weeks?

06:21.214 --> 06:24.342
He won't be leaving until
after my daughter's wedding.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.469
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.514
That's two months away.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.433
Well, I don't mind the van.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.768
No, that's-that's not the point.

06:33.851 --> 06:36.813
Simone, he cheated
on you with men.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.648
Why would you let him stay
for five more seconds?

06:38.731 --> 06:40.525
Well, I tried to throw him out.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.069
- And he wouldn't go?
- He said that if I made him leave,

06:43.152 --> 06:44.904
he would tell all my
friends he was gay

06:44.987 --> 06:47.156
and embarrass me
before the wedding.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.616
So he's threatening you?

06:48.699 --> 06:52.328
No, it's just
a little light blackmail.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.999
All right.
I'll take care of this.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.001
What does that mean?

06:59.085 --> 07:02.505
Nothing. I'm just gonna convince
him that he's making a mistake.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.132
That's adorable.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.341
Hey, I'm serious.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.009
Please, let me help.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.303
Absolutely not.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.055
I'm not gonna break any bones.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.143
I'm just gonna
bend some stuff.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.813
Tommy, how do you expect our
secret affair to remain secret

07:18.896 --> 07:20.356
once you've been
arrested by the police

07:20.439 --> 07:22.358
for beating up my husband?

07:22.441 --> 07:24.193
I was just spitballing.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.612
Well, I appreciate
the passion,

07:26.696 --> 07:29.448
but save it for the van.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.037
I'd still love
to meet Karl alone

07:35.121 --> 07:36.831
in a dark alley some night.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.541
Careful.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.460
He might enjoy that.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.304
Yes. Um, no, I understand,

07:51.387 --> 07:53.723
it's just that I've been through
the deposition twice

07:53.806 --> 07:55.641
and I couldn't
find anything useful.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.768
Eli.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.730
Eli.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.565
- Oh, hey.
- Yes.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.233
I will check again.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.236
Sure.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.071
What's that?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.449
Got it this morning.
It's pretty sweet, right?

08:11.532 --> 08:13.659
Uh, don't you already
have a guitar?

08:13.743 --> 08:16.412
Yeah, no, honey, this is a bass.

08:16.495 --> 08:19.081
Five strings, it sounds
totally different. Check it out.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.378
- Very cool.
- Yeah.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.672
- Oh, are you going to the kitchen?
- Yeah.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.798
Could you grab me a soda?

08:27.882 --> 08:28.966
Sure.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.801
With the, the crushy ice?

08:30.885 --> 08:32.887
- Mm-hmm.
- Love you.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.935
Hey.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.395
Hey. Did you hear the big news?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.105
Eli bought a bass.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.024
Oh, I heard.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.443
He thinks it's gonna help him
work through his writer's block.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.946
Great. That's how he ended up
with his other guitar,

08:50.029 --> 08:51.739
the Xbox and the elliptical.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.157
Got it.

08:53.241 --> 08:56.285
So, how was your day?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.246
Mm.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.957
It was crazy busy. I didn't
even get a chance to eat lunch.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.000
Oh, God, you have to try this.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.460
Here.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.629
It's hot. Careful.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.631
Mmm.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.633
- That's amazing.
- It's good, right?

09:10.716 --> 09:15.137
Yeah. So, did Eli get
any work done today?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.973
I'm not sure.
I was running errands.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.141
- Why don't you ask him?
- No.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.102
If I ask Eli,
"Did you get any writing done?"

09:21.185 --> 09:23.813
what he hears is,
"nag, nag, nag, nag, nag."

09:23.896 --> 09:27.400
- Ah.
- I'm just gonna say nothing and be supportive.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.860
This is my supportive smile.
Tell me what you think.

09:31.779 --> 09:32.863
It's terrifying.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.327
Hey, I have an idea.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.997
After dinner, let's go dancing.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.665
- Tonight?
- Yeah. There's this new club

09:42.748 --> 09:45.543
in Silver Lake
I've been dying to check out.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.461
I have a lot of reading
to do for work.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.088
Oh, come on.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.507
You've been so stressed,
and I can't remember

09:51.591 --> 09:53.718
the last time
we went dancing together.

09:53.801 --> 09:57.680
I could use some alone time,
just you and me.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.140
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.058
So we can go clubbing?

10:01.142 --> 10:04.228
- Clubbing?
- Eli.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.896
Thought you were
playing your bass.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.523
Thought you were
grabbing me a soda.

10:07.606 --> 10:08.733
I was getting to it.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.484
So you guys
are going clubbing, huh?

10:12.069 --> 10:13.571
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.239
All right. I'm in.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.283
Eli, you don't dance.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.161
I dance. In my way.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.205
When you dance, you're
in everyone's way.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.208
Oh...

10:26.292 --> 10:28.461
What? You guys really
don't want me to come?

10:29.462 --> 10:30.880
No. No, no, no.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.715
We'd love for you
to come. Right?

10:32.798 --> 10:34.842
Absolutely.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.764
Whoa. Creepy smile.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.897
Karl?

10:47.980 --> 10:50.066
There she is.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.902
Naomi.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.237
Did we have plans?

10:55.321 --> 10:56.614
No, I just popped in
with a question.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.074
Karl said you went
to the post office,

10:58.157 --> 10:59.325
and so I waited.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.576
For an hour.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.787
Yes. We need
to talk about

11:02.870 --> 11:04.372
the entertainment
for the benefit.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.582
Benefit.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.542
For the burn victims.

11:08.626 --> 11:09.877
Oh, my God.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.212
I forgot all about it.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.381
Simone, you're in charge
of the decorations.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.216
It's fine. I ordered
everything weeks ago.

11:15.299 --> 11:18.636
My mind's been elsewhere
because of recent events.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.513
Are you still up
for your number?

11:20.596 --> 11:23.849
Simone promised the two of
you would reprise your dance.

11:23.933 --> 11:24.934
From the country
club's talent show.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.228
Oh, did she?

11:27.311 --> 11:31.065
I'm not sure I'm up for it now,
given recent events.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.441
Well, if you don't
do something,

11:32.525 --> 11:35.236
Ida Ford is threatening
to sing opera.

11:35.319 --> 11:38.280
Oh, darling. Haven't the burn
victims suffered enough?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.448
All right.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.617
We'll perform.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.952
I'm so glad.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.246
And remember:

11:45.329 --> 11:48.749
if you ever need
to talk about anything,

11:48.833 --> 11:51.752
I am always here.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.588
Yes. You certainly seem to be.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.093
Why did you let her inside?

11:59.176 --> 12:00.970
I'm the one
who should be miffed.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.431
Why didn't you tell me
Naomi saw my car at a motel?

12:03.514 --> 12:04.682
We're lucky that's all she saw.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.766
If she knew
you were having

12:05.850 --> 12:07.643
anonymous sex
with strange men...

12:07.726 --> 12:09.645
It was never anonymous.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.439
And only a few of them
were strange.

12:12.898 --> 12:15.484
I am not the audience
for that joke.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.197
- What <i>are</i> you doing?
- Benefit's in two days.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.365
We need to rehearse.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.324
Ugh, what was I thinking?

12:22.408 --> 12:24.285
I can't dance with you,
I'm still furious.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.370
You'll forget all about that

12:26.454 --> 12:27.538
when we're the center
of attention,

12:27.621 --> 12:28.998
drowning in applause.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.291
Stop trying to charm your way
back into my heart.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.709
It won't work.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.169
Now, you see,
I think you've forgotten

12:33.252 --> 12:34.795
how much fun we have together.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.797
And I am determined
to remind you.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.884
Why are you trying so hard
to hold onto me?

12:39.967 --> 12:41.844
Because I love you, my darling.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.637
Well, I'm not sure that's enough.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.348
Well, try this on
for size.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.267
I actually like you.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.561
How many of your husbands
can say that?

13:02.948 --> 13:04.992
Oh, hey. Ooh, thanks.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.995
Oh, crap.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.538
What? What's wrong?

13:09.622 --> 13:10.873
I think I just saw
my agent.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.542
Lamar's here?
Why don't you go say hi?

13:13.626 --> 13:14.752
No, he's just gonna
give me a hard time

13:14.835 --> 13:15.794
about finishing the script.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.380
There's an easy way
to get him off your back.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.175
- What's that?
- Finish your script.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.052
This kind of attitude is why

13:23.135 --> 13:25.429
I introduce you to people
as my first wife.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.015
Yeah, that's funny.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.558
Is everything okay?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.061
Yeah. I just really want
to dance with you right now.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.395
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.856
- Come on.
- Jade!

13:35.940 --> 13:37.399
Oh, my God!

13:37.483 --> 13:38.859
Wischa! Oh, my God!

13:40.694 --> 13:42.696
Did she say "Wischa"?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.281
- I think so.
- You guys.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.367
These are my friends,
Willow and Mischa.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.578
Wischa. Ah, I get it.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.247
This is, uh, Taylor and Eli.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.831
How do you two know Jade?

13:52.915 --> 13:54.792
Oh...

13:54.875 --> 13:56.085
We met her last year.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.087
Oh, and it was
love at first sight.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.005
Oh, my God, you guys!

14:00.089 --> 14:02.633
Girl, you look
fucking amazing.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.427
Mmm, when fucking
doesn't she?

14:05.511 --> 14:07.179
Fucking never.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.271
I'm getting the feeling that we
weren't Jade's first threesome.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.397
Mm-hmm.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.694
I don't get it.
Why would you want

14:21.777 --> 14:23.571
to start palling around
with this tramp?

14:23.654 --> 14:26.282
Because I want to stop her
from seeing my husband.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.284
And how is buying her
popcorn at the Rialto

14:28.367 --> 14:29.451
gonna make that happen?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.161
I'm trying to
establish trust.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.747
If a stranger came up and
said your dress was ugly,

14:33.831 --> 14:35.124
what would you say?

14:35.207 --> 14:37.126
I'd say fuck off.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.752
But if a dear friend
gently suggested

14:38.836 --> 14:40.754
orange is not
your best color?

14:42.381 --> 14:43.799
I'd get rid of the dress.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.468
If I'm to convince April

14:46.552 --> 14:48.637
it's not in her
best interest

14:48.721 --> 14:49.888
to date a married man,

14:49.972 --> 14:52.141
first I must become
her confidant.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.518
Her close advisor.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.313
Okay.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.981
So when does this
new friendship

14:59.064 --> 15:01.150
- begin to blossom?
- Tonight.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.193
I thought Rob was taking her
to the club tonight.

15:03.277 --> 15:07.239
Do you honestly think I'm
going to let that happen?

15:15.914 --> 15:17.791
You all right?

15:17.875 --> 15:20.294
- No, I'm nervous.
- Why?

15:20.377 --> 15:23.005
Everyone we know
will be in this room tonight.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.382
You've dazzled them all
a hundred times.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.760
Because I knew how much
they envied me.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.304
They'd laugh in my face if
they knew the truth about us.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.349
Here's a thought.
Don't tell them.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.184
People will be able
to figure it out.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.062
Do you honestly believe
we're the only couple here

15:38.145 --> 15:39.730
pretending to be something
that we're not?

15:39.813 --> 15:42.191
- No.
- Trust me,

15:42.274 --> 15:43.734
there is not a woman
here tonight

15:43.817 --> 15:45.486
who wouldn't trade
all of her problems for yours

15:45.569 --> 15:46.695
if she looked
half as beautiful

15:46.779 --> 15:48.697
as you do right now.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.366
But what good is
other people's envy

15:50.449 --> 15:52.242
if it's all based on a lie?

15:52.326 --> 15:54.536
I'm not sure.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.538
Let's find out.

15:58.666 --> 16:02.002
Simone!
You look stunning.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.379
And you look like a teenager.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.382
- How do you get your skin so soft?
- Oh!

16:06.465 --> 16:07.883
It's called a chemical peel.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.718
I know. One more
and she'll be

16:09.802 --> 16:11.595
the Phantom of the Opera.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.223
- Simone!
- Darling. Hello, Barclay.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.226
Sandy, you're out of rehab.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.187
Don't worry, I'll be back.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.398
- Maybe I should go and find our table.
- No need.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.899
I've arranged for us all
to sit here.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.693
Together? What fun.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.736
I think this is a good time
to find the bar.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.197
Liquor's on it's way,
Simone, brought to you by

16:30.280 --> 16:32.991
the most adorable waiter
at the party.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.079
Wine, Mrs. Grove?

16:37.162 --> 16:40.416
Tommy.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.750
You're our waiter?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.585
Yes, Mrs. Grove.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.254
Mr. Grove.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.423
Hello.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.465
Shall we, darling?

16:50.342 --> 16:54.388
So, Mischa, what do
you guys do for a living?

16:54.471 --> 16:56.098
Oh, uh, we're influencers.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.725
Influencers?

16:57.808 --> 16:58.976
On Instagram.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.477
We're sort of famous.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.812
Are you?

17:01.895 --> 17:03.605
Yeah, it's called
@UnderwearEverywhere.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.399
All these underwear brands
pay us stupid money

17:05.482 --> 17:08.318
to post pictures wearing their stuff.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.113
At famous landmarks,
like, all over the world.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.364
Yo, check it.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.243
Oh, wow.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.746
And the Taj Mahal people,
they were okay with that?

17:18.829 --> 17:20.622
Ah, we were in and out
lickety-split.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.666
We had the best time.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.962
We've missed you,
little Jade.

17:27.045 --> 17:29.256
Oh, I missed you.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.300
So, um, how long
are you guys here?

17:31.383 --> 17:34.762
We leave tomorrow night
for Venice.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.972
- No.
- Oh, so soon.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.640
Oh, that sucks.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.101
I was hoping I'd have more time
to hang out with you guys.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.436
Yeah, it sucks.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.188
- Wait, Mischa.
- What?

17:44.271 --> 17:45.814
I just had an idea.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.650
I know what you're thinking,
and it's fucking brilliant.

17:50.068 --> 17:51.361
What are you thinking?

17:51.445 --> 17:52.696
Come with us to Venice tomorrow.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.783
- Oh, my God.
- Tomorrow? Really?

17:55.866 --> 17:57.451
Yeah, it would be so much fun.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.535
Well...

17:58.619 --> 18:00.162
She doesn't have
a plane ticket.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.122
Our assistant can
take care of that.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.832
- You guys have an assistant?
- Yeah.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.043
Guys, come on,
it's such short notice.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.419
That'll cost a fortune.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.505
Oh, please, we've got
tons of miles.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.006
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.341
Do you have
a current passport?

18:12.424 --> 18:13.509
I think so, yeah.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.344
Oh, my God.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.637
Um, hold on.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.056
You can't just leave
the country on a whim.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.683
It's irresponsible.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.854
Okay, Mom.
Geez, calm down.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.606
Excuse me?

18:28.941 --> 18:30.025
Oh, my God!

18:30.108 --> 18:33.737
Oh... this song is my jam!

18:33.821 --> 18:36.240
Guys, let's dance.
Come on.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.825
- Yeah, let's dance.
- All right, let's do it.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.368
Come on.
Let's go, bro.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.494
- Me? Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.455
- Let's do it.
- All right.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.415
I'm going with him. So...

18:53.507 --> 18:54.424
Stanton speaking.

18:54.508 --> 18:55.801
Rob, it's me.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.512
Well, this is a nice surprise.

18:58.595 --> 18:59.972
I don't mean to bother,

19:00.055 --> 19:01.932
but I'm making tuna casserole
for dinner.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.560
Do you prefer bread crumbs
or not?

19:04.643 --> 19:06.228
Honey, I told you
I'm working late tonight.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.897
Oh. Did I forget?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.899
Yeah, our deadline for

19:10.983 --> 19:12.067
the project is
tomorrow morning.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.277
Right.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.571
What was the name of that again?

19:15.654 --> 19:16.947
The Delphi Project.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.491
Of course.
Of course, well,

19:19.575 --> 19:20.742
I'll let you get back to work.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.035
Now, remember, don't wait up.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.580
I won't be home
till the wee hours.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.416
Oh, poor baby.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.667
Well...

19:45.517 --> 19:47.102
Hello, Claire.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.979
Mrs. Stanton.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.063
Your husband didn't tell me
you were gonna stop by.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.065
Oh, Rob isn't expecting me.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.567
This is something of a surprise.

19:56.194 --> 19:58.071
I am desperate
for a cup of coffee.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.448
Could you be so kind?

19:59.531 --> 20:02.951
Well, I'm-I'm not supposed
to leave my desk.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.955
Claire, how often do I
ask you for favors?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.291
Sure, Mrs. Stanton.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.500
I'll be back in a jif.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.169
Don't rush, dear.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.796
Take your time.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.178
Hi there.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.848
Beth Ann.
What are you doing here?

20:24.932 --> 20:26.308
I couldn't bear
the thought of you

20:26.391 --> 20:28.143
getting your dinner
from a vending machine.

20:28.226 --> 20:32.147
Wow, that's thoughtful.

20:32.230 --> 20:33.815
I know you have a kitchen
around here somewhere.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.984
You can pop it in the fridge
until you're ready to eat.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.819
Sure.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.738
Claire, can you come
in here for a second?

20:44.034 --> 20:46.787
Claire?

20:46.870 --> 20:49.164
Ah, she must have wandered off.

20:49.247 --> 20:51.166
I'm sure she'll be back soon.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.001
Now, Robert,

20:53.085 --> 20:55.671
I went to all the trouble
of making this casserole.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.214
I don't want the tuna to spoil.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.222
I will put it
in the fridge.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.537
Mrs. Stanton,
here's your coffee.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.539
Oh, you're so sweet.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.249
It's very hot. You might
want to give it a moment

21:32.332 --> 21:34.209
- to cool off.
- Oh, I don't have time to wait.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.210
I have things to do.

21:35.293 --> 21:36.336
Oh, it'll just take a sec.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.588
You're a treasure. Tell Rob
I'll see him back home.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.886
Who said you could have
a coffee break?

21:55.480 --> 21:56.982
I was so flattered.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.401
Usually when Tommy's company
caters one of my events,

21:59.484 --> 22:00.861
he refuses to wait on me.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.863
But tonight, he asked
for this table.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.072
Did he?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.907
The theme
of this evening

22:05.991 --> 22:07.284
is "South of the Border."

22:07.367 --> 22:09.286
- Yes.
- So, who chose

22:09.369 --> 22:11.204
the flamenco outfits
for the waiters?

22:11.288 --> 22:13.540
I did. Why?

22:13.623 --> 22:15.042
Flamenco is Spanish.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.211
Isn't that what
they speak down there?

22:18.295 --> 22:20.130
Spanish, as in Spain.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.424
Yes, but it still counts
as south of the border.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.093
Yes, if the border
is with France.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.970
Oh, do you see what
I have to live with?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.722
Such a know-it-all.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.098
Yes, I'm forever
flouting my knowledge

22:30.182 --> 22:32.017
that Spain is in Europe.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.477
Naomi,

22:33.560 --> 22:35.103
can I just say I'm stunned

22:35.187 --> 22:36.938
at how handsome
your son's become.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.316
I'm stunned he can
breathe in those pants.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.320
Karl...

22:43.403 --> 22:45.072
you're making
Tommy uncomfortable.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.115
Me? I'm not the one
who dressed him up

22:47.199 --> 22:49.576
as a backup dancer
to Liza Minnelli.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.119
Another scotch,
please, young man.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.121
Yes, Mr. Grove.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.498
Very good.
Thank you.

22:54.581 --> 22:56.625
Hurry back, Tommy.

22:56.708 --> 23:00.170
Can you believe how she's
flirting with my son?

23:00.253 --> 23:01.963
Oh, Sandy is just being playful.

23:02.047 --> 23:05.008
He's 18. She's 32.

23:05.092 --> 23:08.678
Don't you think
that's pathetic?

23:08.762 --> 23:12.599
Excuse me.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.727
Vodka rocks, please.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.687
You have to switch tables.

23:17.771 --> 23:18.980
I can't.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.273
Then at least
stop glaring at Karl.

23:20.357 --> 23:21.650
He's such a jerk.

23:21.733 --> 23:22.943
He's just trying
to be funny.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.569
He's insulting
your dignity.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.323
You can't say that
in those sleeves.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.616
Ah, vodka rocks.

23:29.699 --> 23:33.411
Thank you. Mmm.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.705
You've found
your calling.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.671
Hey!

23:42.754 --> 23:44.172
There you are.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.842
- Here I are.
- Why aren't you dancing?

23:46.925 --> 23:48.510
I'm tired.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.846
- Are you about ready to go?
- Now?

23:50.929 --> 23:53.098
- Yeah.
- I'm having so much fun with Wischa.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.017
Well,
it's after midnight,

23:56.101 --> 23:57.477
and I got to
be up early

23:57.561 --> 23:59.187
and go to my job

23:59.271 --> 24:03.400
that requires me to, you know,
wear clothes, so...

24:05.068 --> 24:06.862
How many of those
have you had?

24:06.945 --> 24:08.572
A couple.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.658
Maybe two couples.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.410
You seem angry.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.370
I'm not angry.

24:15.453 --> 24:18.874
Unless you're going to Venice
with those low-rent Kardashians.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.835
Hey. Taylor, be nice.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.211
Those are my friends.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.172
Yeah, and I'm just
the person who saved you

24:25.255 --> 24:28.550
from an abusive relationship
and let you live in my house,

24:28.633 --> 24:30.594
but fuck me, right?

24:30.677 --> 24:34.890
Okay. Um, I think maybe
you should go home,

24:34.973 --> 24:36.933
and I will...

24:37.017 --> 24:39.060
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.355
- Okay?
- Yeah.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.566
Hey.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.277
Are you going to Venice?

24:49.279 --> 24:50.572
I don't know yet.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.742
Fine. Go!

24:53.825 --> 24:55.702
Have the best time.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.920
- Come on.
- What? Now?

25:05.003 --> 25:07.047
- Yeah, now.
- Okay.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.549
Stanton residence.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.426
Honey, thank God you're there.

25:11.509 --> 25:12.719
Rob.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.763
You sound upset.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.264
Listen, when you were
in my office earlier,

25:16.348 --> 25:18.225
did you happen to move
any papers?

25:18.308 --> 25:19.935
What are you talking about?

25:20.018 --> 25:21.519
The final draft
of the Delphi Project.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.772
It was here on my desk
and now it's gone.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.774
Did you look under your desk?

25:25.857 --> 25:27.442
Yes, I've looked everywhere.

25:27.525 --> 25:29.444
Now, this is
incredibly important.

25:29.527 --> 25:31.947
Are you sure
you didn't touch it?

25:32.030 --> 25:34.407
I know better than
to touch your things.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.159
Damn it.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.287
If I don't find this thing, I'll
have to stay late and redo it,

25:39.371 --> 25:41.289
the whole goddamn thing.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.458
I thought you were
working late anyway.

25:43.541 --> 25:47.837
Uh... that was on
something else.

25:47.921 --> 25:51.007
It doesn't matter. I have to go.
I-I have to go.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.435
Yeah?

26:02.519 --> 26:03.270
Hi, I'd like to speak to Sheila.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.355
You're talking to her.
Who's this?

26:05.438 --> 26:08.275
I think I mean your roommate,
the other Sheila.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.485
Um, this is April
from the diner.

26:10.568 --> 26:12.487
Oh, oh!

26:12.570 --> 26:15.615
Oh, uh, Jesus,
all right, hold on.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.513
You-know-who

26:38.596 --> 26:41.141
is on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.

26:41.224 --> 26:44.519
Hm. I thought she might.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.147
April?

26:47.230 --> 26:49.357
Hi. I know this is late notice,

26:49.441 --> 26:52.527
but would you like to come
with me to the club tonight?

26:52.610 --> 26:53.820
Rob cancelled on me.

26:53.903 --> 26:56.072
I'm a mess
right now, but

26:56.156 --> 26:58.033
I guess I could
throw myself together.

26:58.116 --> 26:58.950
Oh, good.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.535
It's the White Diamond Bar
in Burbank.

27:00.618 --> 27:01.786
I'll meet you there in an hour.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.079
I'll be there.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.876
- What's going on?
- Show some respect, kids.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.253
You're in the presence
of greatness.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.673
Careful, everybody.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.883
- These bowls are hot.
- Ooh!

27:14.966 --> 27:16.426
Tortilla soup.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.887
You can't say this isn't
"South of the Border."

27:18.970 --> 27:20.347
Given Simone's grasp
of geography,

27:20.430 --> 27:22.057
I'm surprised we're
not having clam chowder.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.519
By the way,

27:26.603 --> 27:29.397
have you all heard the latest
news about Larry and Sue?

27:29.481 --> 27:30.565
What about them?

27:30.648 --> 27:32.233
They've separated.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.944
- No!
- Are you really that surprised?

27:35.028 --> 27:36.404
They fought constantly.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.531
In my day, people stayed married

27:38.615 --> 27:40.533
and found a way
to work things out.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.744
Well, that's not
always possible.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.412
Simone's right.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.706
People can care deeply
for one another,

27:46.790 --> 27:48.625
it doesn't always mean that
they should stay married.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.251
You see, this is where
I think commitment

27:50.335 --> 27:52.253
becomes essential.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.130
Everyone
makes mistakes,

27:54.214 --> 27:56.049
but if love is there,

27:56.132 --> 27:57.467
then there's a path
to redemption.

27:57.550 --> 27:58.760
Easy for you to say.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.762
You and Simone
have the perfect marriage.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.222
Oh, hardly.

28:02.305 --> 28:05.725
There are days
when Simone regrets marrying me.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.811
Am I right,
my darling?

28:07.894 --> 28:10.271
- More than a few.
- Yes, I imagine she dreams

28:10.355 --> 28:12.107
of stifling me
with a pillow

28:12.190 --> 28:13.817
or casting me aside
like an old shoe.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.944
Oh, honey, you know
I'd never throw away a shoe.

28:16.027 --> 28:19.114
But you don't get rid of me that
easily. You see, she gave me

28:19.197 --> 28:20.448
her hand in marriage.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.826
- Karl...
- And I'm never

28:22.909 --> 28:24.619
going to let it go.

28:24.702 --> 28:26.996
Oh!

28:27.080 --> 28:28.289
Bloody hell!

28:28.373 --> 28:29.749
Tommy, how could you
be so clumsy?

28:29.833 --> 28:32.127
Sorry, Mr. Grove.

28:32.210 --> 28:35.588
Let me get you some napkins.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.010
Clearly, he did that on purpose.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.012
No, he just wasn't
paying attention.

28:43.096 --> 28:46.182
You know how
teenagers are.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.484
Okay, sober person, here we go.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.153
Give me this.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.363
Stop. Hey.
Eli, don't rush me.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.991
I'm not rushing you. There.

29:03.074 --> 29:06.661
You know what? I don't get it.

29:06.744 --> 29:08.079
What's that?
What don't you get?

29:08.163 --> 29:09.873
I don't get what Jade sees
in those people.

29:09.956 --> 29:11.708
- Wischa?
- Yeah.

29:11.791 --> 29:13.543
They're fake as shit.

29:13.626 --> 29:16.004
Yes, they are.
Okay, legs, pants.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.006
And you know what?

29:18.089 --> 29:20.800
Why would anyone want to see
them in their underwear?

29:20.884 --> 29:22.010
Ugh.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.679
'Cause they're not even
that pretty.

29:24.762 --> 29:26.014
Do you think they're pretty?

29:26.097 --> 29:28.558
Only their bodies
and their faces.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.897
And now Jade's going with them
to Venice?

29:33.980 --> 29:35.857
- Mm-hmm.
- Fuck her.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.692
What's funny?

29:37.775 --> 29:41.362
You. You're funny 'cause
you're drunk and ridiculous,

29:41.446 --> 29:42.864
and that's a nice
change of pace.

29:42.947 --> 29:43.865
From what?

29:43.948 --> 29:46.201
Well, usually you're the one
taking care of me

29:46.284 --> 29:47.744
when I'm doing something stupid.

29:47.827 --> 29:49.662
- I do take care of you.
- Yes, you do.

29:49.746 --> 29:52.499
- I take care of everybody.
- Okay.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.252
Hey, don't feel bad
in the morning, okay?

29:56.336 --> 29:57.879
Why would I feel bad?

29:57.962 --> 30:00.006
'Cause you'll remember
how rude you were to Jade.

30:02.258 --> 30:03.885
Don't worry, she'll forgive you.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.345
Mm, fuck you.

30:05.428 --> 30:07.805
And so will I.

30:09.766 --> 30:13.561
I am so happy you came.
You look amazing.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.355
It was very kind
for you to invite me.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.065
I never go to places
like this.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.025
Well, if you hadn't come,
I would've had to stay home,

30:19.108 --> 30:21.694
and where is
the fun in that?

30:23.780 --> 30:25.907
It's a shame your fella
couldn't make it.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.701
Yeah, he said he had
to work late, but who knows?

30:28.785 --> 30:31.079
Married men who cheat

30:31.162 --> 30:32.747
also know how to lie.

30:32.830 --> 30:35.917
It must be frustrating.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.378
Never knowing if Rob

30:38.461 --> 30:40.380
is going to stand you up
for his wife.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.590
It can be annoying,

30:42.674 --> 30:44.592
but it's a trade-off.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.262
So what do you get
out of the deal?

30:47.345 --> 30:49.556
Freedom.

30:49.639 --> 30:50.974
See, I don't want
to get married.

30:51.057 --> 30:54.102
So this is just a...

30:54.185 --> 30:55.937
casual fling?

30:56.020 --> 30:58.648
Yeah. Rob's wife will get him
back when I'm done with him,

30:58.731 --> 30:59.899
good as new.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.901
And if he keeps
working late,

31:01.985 --> 31:04.112
it's going to be
in a couple of weeks.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.282
Oh, good. For you.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.617
I mean, good for you.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.580
Where is our waiter?

31:13.663 --> 31:16.833
So, April, why don't you want
to get married?

31:16.916 --> 31:19.919
Because I want to have a career.

31:20.003 --> 31:22.755
Doing what?

31:24.716 --> 31:25.967
I want to be a singer.

31:26.050 --> 31:29.137
Really?

31:29.220 --> 31:31.973
That's kind of why
I wanted to come here.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.183
They have girls that sing
with the combo on the weekends,

31:34.267 --> 31:35.977
so I'm gonna introduce myself
to the manager,

31:36.060 --> 31:40.940
and then I am going
to audition for him.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.483
I had no idea you sang.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.153
I started in the church choir
back at home.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.988
Folks there think
I'm pretty talented.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.325
I'm gonna be somebody someday.

31:50.408 --> 31:53.119
You just watch.

31:56.414 --> 31:59.042
I love music.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.336
I used to play the piano.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.378
No kidding.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.963
Yeah, I took
lessons for years.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.173
Well, do you
still play?

32:05.256 --> 32:07.508
The truth is,

32:07.592 --> 32:11.679
my husband didn't care
for my playing.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.515
I made the mistake of telling
him I wanted to give a recital,

32:14.599 --> 32:15.975
and he just laughed.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.853
He said I wasn't as good
as I thought I was.

32:18.936 --> 32:20.980
That sort of

32:21.064 --> 32:23.524
took the wind out of my sail.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.818
Oh, honey.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.490
Your husband's dead.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.159
Don't you think it's time
you stopped listening to him?

32:36.913 --> 32:41.542
Can I just say I am very happy
to be here tonight?

32:41.626 --> 32:44.420
Well, here's to us.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.388
Taylor, what are you doing?

32:53.471 --> 32:55.848
You were right.
I have to go find Jade.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.101
It's 4:00 in the morning.

32:58.184 --> 33:02.063
I was such a bitch,
and now she's going to Venice,

33:02.146 --> 33:05.024
and it's all my fault,
and I have to fix this.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.151
All right, well, you don't
even know where she is.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.946
Yes, I do, okay?
I-I... She's at their hotel.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.865
- How do you know that?
- I put Find My Friends on her phone.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.618
- You're tracking her?
- I got to go.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.287
Oh, my God.

33:18.371 --> 33:21.749
Hey, what the fuck
has gotten into you?

33:21.833 --> 33:23.292
I can't lose her.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.378
Well, you can wait until
she gets home to talk to her.

33:25.461 --> 33:26.921
What if she
doesn't come back?

33:27.004 --> 33:28.923
What if she's already
on a plane to Venice

33:29.006 --> 33:30.091
and I never see her again?

33:30.174 --> 33:31.884
You just said
she's at the hotel.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.553
I need her.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.639
If she leaves, this whole
fucking thing falls apart.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.270
No...

33:42.353 --> 33:43.730
No.

33:43.813 --> 33:44.897
Stop the car.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.276
What does that mean?

33:48.359 --> 33:50.111
What whole thing falls apart?

33:50.194 --> 33:51.612
Eli, get off.

33:51.696 --> 33:52.447
No, you're gonna get out

33:52.530 --> 33:53.614
and you're gonna
talk to me right now,

33:53.698 --> 33:54.824
Taylor.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.285
Really?

34:03.416 --> 34:05.293
Just talk to me, Taylor.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.921
What's going on?

34:09.005 --> 34:10.423
Come on.

34:10.506 --> 34:13.676
I asked you before
if you were in love with her.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.011
I-I know, I know.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.846
- You lied to me.
- Not exactly.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.973
Then what the hell
are we doing in the driveway?

34:19.056 --> 34:20.975
Eli, come on, please.

34:21.058 --> 34:22.310
This is, this is too hard!

34:22.393 --> 34:24.145
- What?
- I-I don't know.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.065
- What?
- My life, my l... my life is so hard!

34:27.148 --> 34:30.526
I-I... The hours I work,
the cases I take.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.946
And then I come home
to this house.

34:34.030 --> 34:37.658
This big, fucking house
that we can't afford!

34:37.742 --> 34:39.327
And I have
to pay for it

34:39.410 --> 34:42.246
because you haven't sold
a script in two years.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.999
But I can't
bring that up

34:45.082 --> 34:47.293
because then I'm a bitch.

34:47.376 --> 34:50.213
So I say nothing.

34:53.758 --> 34:56.803
And Jade is the only thing
in my life that is easy.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.180
'Cause she
doesn't take.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.307
She only gives.

35:04.101 --> 35:06.354
If she leaves,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.399
Why didn't you tell me
any of this before?

35:12.443 --> 35:14.570
Come on.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.697
I don't want to hurt you.

35:17.824 --> 35:20.409
Oh, well, great call.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.745
'Cause it hurts.

35:25.331 --> 35:27.250
So, I mean...

35:27.333 --> 35:29.085
Do you want me to go?

35:29.168 --> 35:30.545
No.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.171
Eli, I love you.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.423
But you want her to stay.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.555
I mean...

35:40.638 --> 35:42.640
How does that even work?

35:44.642 --> 35:46.811
I don't know.

35:47.812 --> 35:48.938
I don't.

35:49.021 --> 35:51.858
But it has to.

35:51.941 --> 35:55.278
Because otherwise, it's just
too hard to be married to me.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.740
No. Eli...

36:22.847 --> 36:24.265
I got fired.

36:24.348 --> 36:27.059
I'm not surprised.
What you did was childish.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.770
- He was grabbing you.
- He was holding my hand.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.272
- Why do you keep defending him?
- I'm not.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.065
He's lied to you,
he's cheated on you

36:33.149 --> 36:35.276
and he won't
leave your home.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.236
The situation is complicated.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.405
Well, yeah, it must be,
because it makes no sense.

36:39.488 --> 36:41.616
- You should hate him.
- I know, I know, it's just...

36:41.699 --> 36:43.784
He's my husband.

36:45.494 --> 36:49.332
He puts up with my extravagance
and my nonsense.

36:50.750 --> 36:54.629
He tells me I'm beautiful when I
need to hear it the most and...

36:54.712 --> 36:57.798
he makes me laugh
in a way that no one else can.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.592
Simone...

36:59.675 --> 37:01.260
One day, I will divorce Karl,

37:01.344 --> 37:03.304
but I will
never hate him,

37:03.387 --> 37:06.015
because I can't.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.937
Where does that leave me?

37:11.020 --> 37:14.482
In the back of a van

37:14.565 --> 37:17.318
having a marvelous time.

37:17.401 --> 37:21.113
Yeah, well, van came
with the job, so...

37:21.197 --> 37:22.698
Don't worry.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.659
We'll figure it out.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.829
Mrs. Grove.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.790
Mrs. Harte says
it's time for your number.

37:30.873 --> 37:32.875
Thank you.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.132
I have to go.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.651
Hi.

38:00.277 --> 38:02.279
Hey.

38:03.614 --> 38:07.410
Listen, about tonight,
I'm so sorry.

38:07.493 --> 38:10.746
- You don't have to apologize.
- No, I do.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.873
I really do.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.794
Thank you.

38:19.797 --> 38:23.467
So, I decided to go to Venice
with Mischa and Willow.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.762
Oh.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.725
It's time.

38:30.808 --> 38:33.728
Being here with you
and Eli, it's...

38:34.770 --> 38:37.273
...starting to feel like a home.

38:37.356 --> 38:39.942
I'm getting attached.

38:41.986 --> 38:45.031
Which always leads
to me getting hurt.

38:45.114 --> 38:49.410
When it ends. So...

38:49.493 --> 38:52.830
I should go.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.668
What if it
doesn't have to end?

38:58.669 --> 39:00.129
What if you stayed?

39:00.212 --> 39:02.381
What if this was your home?

39:05.634 --> 39:07.261
Here with us.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.432
What are you saying?

39:11.515 --> 39:13.601
Live with us.

39:22.276 --> 39:23.694
Be with us.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.655
Yeah.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.116
There's no reason
to leave.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.535
You just got home.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.674
Hi.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.093
Oh, you're still up.

39:47.176 --> 39:48.928
Of course.

39:49.011 --> 39:51.847
Did you get your work finished?

39:51.931 --> 39:53.599
Yep.

39:53.682 --> 39:56.977
I redid the whole project.
It took forever.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.314
I could fix you
a snack if you like.

40:00.397 --> 40:04.485
No. I'm gonna make myself
a martini, take a shower

40:04.568 --> 40:06.487
and go to bed.

40:06.570 --> 40:09.365
All right.

40:13.953 --> 40:17.081
Would it bother you if I played
the piano for a bit?

40:18.249 --> 40:20.000
It's after midnight.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.752
I know. If you'd rather
I didn't...

40:21.836 --> 40:25.214
Nah. Whatever you want.

41:29.486 --> 41:32.198
Honey, I need an olive
for my martini.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.618
Check the fridge.

42:25.834 --> 42:28.462
- I can't find the olives.
- Top shelf.

42:28.545 --> 42:30.881
I checked. They weren't there.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.301
Check again.

42:34.385 --> 42:35.803
Honey!

42:35.886 --> 42:40.140
It's not really a martini

42:40.224 --> 42:42.476
without an olive.

43:18.304 --> 43:21.223
Thanks. You know,

43:21.307 --> 43:24.018
it is so late.

43:24.101 --> 43:26.145
We should turn in.
