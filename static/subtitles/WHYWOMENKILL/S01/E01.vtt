01:15.790 --> 01:17.981
I started dating Beth
Ann in high school.

01:18.267 --> 01:22.170
She used to make me sandwiches and...
sew buttons on my shirts.

01:23.056 --> 01:26.759
I tell you, there's nothing sexier than
a girl who likes to take care of you.

01:27.848 --> 01:32.298
I was introduced to Simone at a benefit.
Oh, the entrance she made.

01:32.845 --> 01:35.603
Designer gown, dripping in diamonds.

01:36.559 --> 01:40.345
You could tell from the way she walked,
she knew she was fabulous.

01:40.656 --> 01:42.970
I first saw Taylor at a women's march.

01:43.142 --> 01:45.835
She was giving a speech about
dismantling the patriarchy.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.087
And I don't really remember much of it,
because the entire time she was speaking

01:49.087 --> 01:50.654
I was just thinking,

01:51.134 --> 01:53.743
"That is one hot feminist."

01:54.035 --> 01:56.195
Beth Ann was a virgin
on our wedding night.

01:56.220 --> 01:57.806
I was Simone's third husband.

01:57.831 --> 01:59.875
Right away,
Taylor told me she was bisexual.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.069
She wanted nothing more
than to be a housewife.

02:02.094 --> 02:03.816
Oh, she loved to shop and throw parties.

02:03.816 --> 02:05.228
So I married a lawyer.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.422
My Jewish parents were thrilled.

02:07.447 --> 02:08.939
We were very happy...

02:09.801 --> 02:11.314
for the first few years.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.047
Until she discovered my secret.

02:13.072 --> 02:16.306
And then, all hell broke loose.

02:35.798 --> 02:37.790
Can you believe it?

02:38.509 --> 02:41.648
Oh, Rob. It's lovely.

02:41.673 --> 02:43.073
Damn straight.

02:43.861 --> 02:47.992
- And it's so big.
- Well, it's a mansion, is what it is.

02:48.017 --> 02:51.329
Yeah, you're married to a guy
who can afford a goddamn mansion.

02:52.838 --> 02:54.054
Oh.

02:54.079 --> 02:56.024
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:56.049 --> 02:59.171
Sheila Mosconi.
This is my husband, Leo.

02:59.196 --> 03:00.695
I guess you're our new neighbors.

03:00.719 --> 03:03.500
I must apologize for
my husband's language.

03:03.525 --> 03:06.576
He's excited because we've never
lived anywhere this nice before.

03:06.601 --> 03:07.914
He doesn't usually swear.

03:07.939 --> 03:11.484
- Relax. We're from Brooklyn.
- Yeah. We don't give a fuck.

03:13.378 --> 03:14.578
Yes.

03:14.812 --> 03:16.758
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

03:17.094 --> 03:19.248
After you unpack, invite us over.

03:19.273 --> 03:22.623
I'll give you the skinny on all the
neighbors. You know, who to avoid.

03:22.648 --> 03:24.945
She just wants to see if your
furniture's nicer than ours.

03:24.945 --> 03:28.763
I married a tightwad. I know that
her furniture is nicer than ours.

03:29.164 --> 03:32.057
The moving men will be here any second.
After they're done,

03:32.183 --> 03:34.183
we would love to host you.

03:38.201 --> 03:40.023
I saw you talking to the neighbors.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.055
What are they like?

03:42.983 --> 03:44.244
Italian.

03:44.454 --> 03:45.854
Oh...

04:12.258 --> 04:13.658
Karl?

04:16.325 --> 04:18.686
- Karl?
- I'm in here, Simone.

04:18.711 --> 04:21.623
Oh. The phone is going
to ring any second.

04:21.648 --> 04:24.367
It'll be Henri, my hairdresser,
and he will be livid.

04:24.392 --> 04:26.459
- What have you done?
- I'm 20 minutes late.

04:26.484 --> 04:29.429
Again. He's gonna try to say
he's given away my appointment.

04:29.453 --> 04:31.936
Don't let him.
Insist I left an hour ago,

04:31.961 --> 04:33.733
and that you're beyond frantic.

04:33.758 --> 04:35.384
Can you do that, darling?
Can you lie for me?

04:35.384 --> 04:39.050
Well, last week, I told Delia Butrose
you'd never had work done.

04:39.075 --> 04:41.064
This is why you're the
best husband I've ever had.

04:41.064 --> 04:43.281
I was just hoping to
be in the top three.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.330
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry home.

04:46.601 --> 04:48.719
Our party starts at 7:00.

04:48.930 --> 04:50.888
You know me. I'm never late.

04:52.016 --> 04:53.476
For a party.

05:29.171 --> 05:31.106
Saul. My man.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.796
I just got your text. What's up?

05:33.191 --> 05:37.202
Actually, it's my wife.
She requires a little face time.

05:37.953 --> 05:39.353
Geez.

05:42.229 --> 05:43.623
- Hey, Saul.
- Hey.

05:43.647 --> 05:47.365
Hey. I just had a quick question
about the blueprints for the remodel.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.085
What seems to be the problem?

05:49.110 --> 05:52.391
Well, see, I asked for a window
to be put in the side of the building.

05:52.416 --> 05:54.336
But you put it in the back.

05:54.361 --> 05:56.126
Yeah. I had to do it that way.

05:56.728 --> 05:58.453
Okay, but why?

05:58.478 --> 06:00.619
Well, it's a structural thing.

06:04.681 --> 06:06.689
It's hard to explain.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.492
Oh.

06:08.517 --> 06:10.367
Well, I'm a smart girl. Give it a try.

06:11.118 --> 06:13.100
Relax, sweetheart,
it's gonna look great.

06:13.533 --> 06:14.744
Okay, Saul,

06:15.150 --> 06:16.814
here's what I think is going on.

06:16.839 --> 06:18.733
You want to finish this job quickly

06:18.758 --> 06:20.969
and move on to the next
one, and it's easier

06:20.994 --> 06:24.025
to put the window there
instead of where I want it.

06:25.999 --> 06:27.408
Am I right?

06:30.251 --> 06:34.259
I've been in construction 40 years.
No one's ever questioned my integrity.

06:34.517 --> 06:37.259
And until you can speak my language,

06:37.595 --> 06:39.735
you're just gonna have
to trust me, sweetie.

06:41.447 --> 06:43.820
I may not understand construction,

06:43.845 --> 06:47.047
but I do understand contracts.

06:47.759 --> 06:51.132
Especially the one you signed,
which clearly states that,

06:51.823 --> 06:55.962
I don't have to pay you unless the work
is completed to my satisfaction.

06:57.126 --> 07:01.215
And that means, for the purpose of this,
and all future conversations,

07:01.672 --> 07:03.915
my dick is bigger than yours.

07:06.422 --> 07:08.696
Am I speaking your language now, Saul?

07:11.069 --> 07:12.269
Yes.

07:12.615 --> 07:13.815
Good.

07:18.477 --> 07:19.877
It's okay, man.

07:20.180 --> 07:21.647
Her dick's also bigger than mine.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.541
You get used to it.

07:23.789 --> 07:26.906
I found the coasters.
They were in the last box I looked in.

07:26.930 --> 07:29.111
Sheila and Leo were just telling
me about the neighborhood.

07:29.111 --> 07:31.870
Oh, you are gonna love the supermarket.
It's five blocks away

07:31.871 --> 07:34.355
- and it's got everything.
- I can't wait.

07:34.641 --> 07:36.304
I have so much shopping to do.

07:36.329 --> 07:39.660
And the schools here are excellent.
You guys got kids?

07:41.178 --> 07:43.063
Uh... no.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.079
Well, we have four little rug rats.

07:45.104 --> 07:47.759
At some point, they are gonna
break something that you own.

07:47.784 --> 07:49.469
Not to worry. We will pay for it.

07:49.790 --> 07:53.104
We make up for being bad parents
by being good neighbors.

07:56.574 --> 07:57.774
Rob,

07:57.875 --> 08:00.075
why do I get the feeling
we've met before?

08:00.477 --> 08:01.860
I don't know, Leo.

08:01.885 --> 08:04.758
I mean, your face looks
so familiar to me.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.460
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm in aerospace engineering.

08:08.485 --> 08:09.885
Ever hear of Cyther-Tech?

08:10.219 --> 08:12.617
- No.
- They have contracts with NASA.

08:13.258 --> 08:15.351
I help design rockets.

08:15.972 --> 08:17.920
I'm in dry cleaning, myself.

08:17.945 --> 08:20.664
Got four stores.
Practically a chain.

08:24.016 --> 08:27.059
Sounds more impressive
if no one's been talking about rockets.

08:27.084 --> 08:29.430
Oh... Uh...

08:33.117 --> 08:36.492
- Rob, can I say something?
- Sure. What's up?

08:36.703 --> 08:39.906
If you want more coffee, ask for it.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.625
I beg your pardon?

08:46.101 --> 08:49.031
Just tapping on your cup?
Come on.

08:49.056 --> 08:52.312
That's how you treat a maid,
not your wife.

08:58.047 --> 08:59.047
Okay.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.865
See... this is my fault.
See, I bought Sheila

09:01.890 --> 09:05.435
a copy of The Feminine Mystique.
I-I thought it was a sex manual.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.725
She's been acting militant ever since.

09:07.929 --> 09:09.129
Sorry.

09:12.616 --> 09:17.835
- Honey, does my tapping offend you?
- Of course not.

09:18.663 --> 09:21.249
Rob is such a wonderful provider.

09:21.913 --> 09:24.913
I consider it an honor
to take care of him.

09:28.752 --> 09:33.089
- See? She's happy.
- Didn't mean to spoil the mood.

09:33.558 --> 09:34.904
Sorry, Rob.

09:35.061 --> 09:36.733
Apology accepted.

09:37.085 --> 09:39.750
To show there's no hard feelings,
next time you two are in Glendale,

09:39.750 --> 09:43.161
stop by Cyther-Tech
and I'll give you the grand tour.

09:43.186 --> 09:46.436
- You work in Glendale?
- Yeah. That's where we're based.

09:47.396 --> 09:48.596
Huh.

09:52.132 --> 09:54.615
Well, it's getting late.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.193
You guys have unpacking to do,

09:56.218 --> 09:58.265
- and we have kids to spank.
- Yeah.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.427
We're so happy to have
made two new friends.

10:01.452 --> 10:03.819
Ah, we feel the same way.

10:03.844 --> 10:05.554
Take care, Beth Ann.

10:06.509 --> 10:07.909
Rob.

10:17.304 --> 10:19.819
Simone! The house.

10:19.844 --> 10:21.887
It's finally done.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.001
My decorator finished Friday.
What do you think?

10:24.149 --> 10:26.369
I'm so jealous I could kill myself.

10:26.394 --> 10:28.206
Oh. That's the look I was going for.

10:28.518 --> 10:32.382
- Darling, I got you a scotch.
- Oh... Thank you, my love.

10:32.407 --> 10:34.054
Don't I have the nicest husband?

10:34.079 --> 10:36.499
I don't know.
Ed died and left me six million.

10:36.524 --> 10:37.924
That was pretty nice.

10:38.308 --> 10:40.960
Oh. Where's Wanda?
Didn't she come with you?

10:40.985 --> 10:42.585
Wanda couldn't make it.

10:42.610 --> 10:44.891
Oh. Why not?

10:45.446 --> 10:47.405
She's in a dark place lately.

10:47.430 --> 10:50.375
Charles is divorcing her
because she won't stop drinking.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.087
Oh, poor thing.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.335
Mom, I'm working.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.646
I'll pretend not to know you in
exchange for some cheese balls.

10:59.671 --> 11:02.178
- How many do you want?
- Leave the tray.

11:04.281 --> 11:06.433
I feel so badly for Wanda.

11:07.639 --> 11:10.031
Why don't I throw a lunch in her honor?

11:10.056 --> 11:12.327
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.

11:12.352 --> 11:15.584
I think she could use a show
of support from her friends.

11:15.609 --> 11:16.809
Honey.

11:17.047 --> 11:18.943
Wanda doesn't like you.

11:20.592 --> 11:23.646
- You lie.
- Remember when we went to Le Dôme?

11:23.671 --> 11:26.631
Charles had just moved
out the day before.

11:26.656 --> 11:28.455
Wanda was crushed.

11:28.761 --> 11:31.608
And I told delightful
anecdotes to make her laugh.

11:31.633 --> 11:33.112
Stories about your trips to Italy

11:33.137 --> 11:35.482
and your thriving art
gallery and how much money

11:35.507 --> 11:37.374
you're spending on your
daughter's wedding.

11:37.375 --> 11:38.850
Misery loves company.

11:38.875 --> 11:41.500
You should've just said that
your life isn't so perfect either.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.328
But my life is perfect.

11:43.353 --> 11:46.976
That's exactly the type of thing
your friends don't want to hear.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.578
Simone?

11:53.688 --> 11:55.088
Everything all right?

11:55.593 --> 11:57.179
Naomi says that

11:57.960 --> 11:59.704
Wanda doesn't like me.

11:59.929 --> 12:03.890
- I'm just devastated.
- Oh, my poor darling.

12:04.203 --> 12:08.171
Here, would it help to dance?

12:09.382 --> 12:10.937
I believe it would.

12:19.117 --> 12:21.538
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:25.318 --> 12:28.218
Really? You want to throw
another jacket on that chair?

12:28.242 --> 12:30.256
I'm so tired.

12:30.281 --> 12:33.110
- There's a coat rack right there.
- You're complaining about me?

12:33.110 --> 12:35.585
There's three pairs of your pants
hanging over the side of the couch.

12:35.585 --> 12:37.176
Well, we don't have a pants rack.

12:37.201 --> 12:39.606
Well, now you've ruined
your birthday surprise.

12:43.510 --> 12:45.304
Yeah, yeah.

12:47.335 --> 12:48.735
Get any writing done?

12:51.132 --> 12:53.632
A couple pages, nothing much.

12:56.350 --> 12:57.750
That's something.

12:59.686 --> 13:01.547
Oh, what're we gonna do about dinner?

13:01.958 --> 13:03.220
Oh, I was thinking pizza.

13:03.245 --> 13:07.341
Ah. My mom used to love pizza.

13:08.139 --> 13:09.670
What did you think of her body?

13:10.522 --> 13:11.922
Salad it is.

13:16.510 --> 13:17.710
Hello?

13:17.870 --> 13:19.270
Hey, what's up?

13:19.631 --> 13:21.031
What?

13:21.350 --> 13:24.006
Okay, honey, honey, calm down.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.491
No. Where is he now?

13:27.217 --> 13:29.444
No, I'll be right over.
Don't open the door.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.780
Who was that?

13:31.850 --> 13:35.880
My friend Jade. She has this crazy ex
who's been stalking her.

13:35.905 --> 13:37.327
So you're going over there?

13:37.352 --> 13:41.194
There's a car parked outside her condo.
I'll check it out, I'll come right back.

13:41.397 --> 13:44.410
- You never mentioned Jade before.
- Well, she's a new friend.

13:44.411 --> 13:47.334
- Where are my keys?
- Oh... you fucking her?

13:48.065 --> 13:49.692
- Yeah.
- What happened to Alicia?

13:49.693 --> 13:51.366
She moved back to Peru.

13:51.758 --> 13:53.383
How come you didn't tell
me you had a new hookup?

13:53.383 --> 13:55.297
Honey, we don't always
share that kind of stuff.

13:55.297 --> 13:58.989
- I mean, are you seeing anyone lately?
- No, no. I mean, no one interesting.

13:59.014 --> 14:00.788
- Oh.
- Should I come with you?

14:01.178 --> 14:02.279
To do what?

14:02.304 --> 14:04.897
Well, if it's her ex and it
gets violent, I can, you know,

14:05.806 --> 14:07.206
I can scream for help.

14:08.124 --> 14:10.453
- I adore you.
- Well, only 'cause I'm adorable.

14:10.477 --> 14:12.299
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

14:13.912 --> 14:15.230
I'd like to keep kissing you...

14:15.230 --> 14:17.375
But you have to go help
your lesbian lover.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.643
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

14:18.668 --> 14:19.868
Okay.

14:21.039 --> 14:22.604
I'm ordering pizza.

14:41.186 --> 14:44.104
Honey, put that back.
We don't need any more cookies.

14:44.394 --> 14:45.594
I said no.

14:56.066 --> 14:57.268
You don't say.

14:57.293 --> 14:59.328
They invited us over for coffee.

14:59.353 --> 15:00.767
So, as we're talking,

15:00.792 --> 15:03.619
Leo realizes where
he's seen this guy before.

15:03.644 --> 15:06.663
- Where had he seen him?
- In Glendale. Right down the street

15:06.688 --> 15:09.999
from Cyther-Tech,
which is where the guy works.

15:10.024 --> 15:12.062
And what did Leo say this guy was doing?

15:12.087 --> 15:14.931
Leo said he saw him in the parking lot
of some diner.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.382
Rob was kissing a waitress.

15:18.039 --> 15:20.883
- Are you gonna tell the wife?
- Well, I just met the woman.

15:20.907 --> 15:23.821
How am I gonna let her know that
her husband is having an affair?

15:28.141 --> 15:29.541
Beth Ann.

15:29.698 --> 15:31.098
Beth Ann!

15:31.627 --> 15:33.027
Beth Ann!

15:36.223 --> 15:39.592
Tommy, can you ask Gustav
if he's ready to serve the desserts?

15:39.617 --> 15:41.017
Sure thing, Mrs. Grove.

15:42.195 --> 15:43.634
Oh, what's this?

15:44.235 --> 15:46.751
I don't know.
It was here when I came in.

15:58.931 --> 16:00.682
Gustav said desserts are good to go.

16:00.930 --> 16:02.330
Oh, thank you.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.987
Mrs. Grove?

16:05.243 --> 16:08.424
- Is, uh, is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

16:08.572 --> 16:10.087
Absolutely fine.

16:26.728 --> 16:28.128
...I'm happy.

16:38.546 --> 16:39.546
Hey.

16:39.571 --> 16:41.114
- Hey.
- What happened?

16:41.139 --> 16:43.825
Her ex was definitely in the car.
We had to call the cops.

16:43.873 --> 16:45.273
Oh, my God.

16:45.557 --> 16:46.949
- Yeah.
- Did they arrest him?

16:46.974 --> 16:48.793
Duke... that's his name...

16:48.818 --> 16:50.053
- Great name.
- He drove away

16:50.053 --> 16:51.684
- before they got there.
- Whoa.

16:52.093 --> 16:54.225
Well, she shouldn't go back to
the condo until they find him.

16:54.225 --> 16:56.013
- Right. That's what I told her.
- Good.

16:57.062 --> 16:58.933
So did you take her to a hotel?

17:00.672 --> 17:02.072
Um...

17:02.855 --> 17:03.855
What?

17:03.889 --> 17:05.289
Don't be mad...

17:06.120 --> 17:07.254
About what?

17:07.279 --> 17:08.679
Jade's outside.

17:09.414 --> 17:10.814
No!

17:11.030 --> 17:13.511
- She didn't want to be alone.
- I don't care.

17:13.544 --> 17:15.480
- Eli.
- Rule number one:

17:15.505 --> 17:17.328
We don't bring our
hookups into the house.

17:17.333 --> 17:18.832
But I'm worried about her.

17:19.184 --> 17:21.029
Which means you've violated
rule number two.

17:21.029 --> 17:23.707
You've become emotionally involved.
That is an insult to me

17:23.732 --> 17:25.910
and the sacred institution
known as open marriage.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.519
Damn it, Taylor,
this is a really big favor.

17:30.544 --> 17:31.944
I know, baby.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.183
All right, fine, one night.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.287
- I told her she could stay the weekend.
- Two nights.

17:36.287 --> 17:37.644
Monday is Labor Day,

17:37.669 --> 17:39.758
- so technically...
- Three nights. Final offer.

17:40.349 --> 17:41.549
Thank you.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.371
Okay, um,
should we pick up a little bit?

17:44.396 --> 17:45.796
No.

17:46.095 --> 17:49.152
I want the Pasadena bisexual
community to see how you live.

17:49.177 --> 17:50.577
Oh, Lord.

17:54.505 --> 17:56.105
Come on in, Jade.

17:56.130 --> 17:57.777
- Hey.
- Hey, this is Eli.

17:57.802 --> 17:59.202
Hey.

17:59.730 --> 18:03.309
Thank you so much for letting me stay.
I really, really appreciate it.

18:05.140 --> 18:08.953
We're gonna put Jade in the guest room.
Will you grab her suitcase, honey?

18:12.446 --> 18:13.846
Eli?

18:14.567 --> 18:15.967
Huh?

18:16.962 --> 18:18.192
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

18:18.217 --> 18:19.715
- Oh!
- Oh, my gosh!

18:19.740 --> 18:21.252
- Are you okay?
- Nothing's broken.

18:21.584 --> 18:23.840
It's all good. Right up here.
Right this way.

18:35.654 --> 18:37.054
Beth Ann?

18:37.411 --> 18:38.811
Sheila.

18:39.499 --> 18:41.684
- Now is not a good time.
- I'll be quick.

18:42.028 --> 18:44.418
- I must apologize.
- Please.

18:44.443 --> 18:47.059
I have to get my housework
done before Rob gets home.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.347
I just feel awful about what you heard.

18:49.506 --> 18:51.334
You have every right to hate me.

18:51.359 --> 18:53.043
I don't hate you.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.840
Just know that I won't be sharing
that story with anyone else.

18:56.865 --> 19:00.034
Good, because it's not true.

19:01.323 --> 19:03.031
- Beth Ann...
- It's not.

19:03.431 --> 19:04.937
Leo is mistaken.

19:08.088 --> 19:09.883
He knows what he saw.

19:10.339 --> 19:14.711
Rob kissed a blonde waitress
in the parking lot of Jansen's Diner.

19:17.558 --> 19:19.297
It's impossible.

19:21.692 --> 19:23.875
Maybe you should talk to him.

19:29.450 --> 19:31.008
He couldn't.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.765
He wouldn't put me through that.

19:36.195 --> 19:37.595
He's a man.

19:38.287 --> 19:39.828
Some of them cheat.

19:40.321 --> 19:41.721
Not Rob.

19:42.352 --> 19:43.752
Not Rob.

19:46.121 --> 19:49.015
Not after what happened to our daughter.

19:53.585 --> 19:55.164
You had a daughter?

19:58.212 --> 19:59.612
Oh, honey.

20:10.617 --> 20:13.593
So, please, tell Leo he's wrong.

20:15.438 --> 20:17.922
Rob and I are so very happy.

20:48.932 --> 20:49.936
Oh, shit.

20:49.961 --> 20:52.539
It's fine, Myron.
You know what they say:

20:52.564 --> 20:54.650
It's not a party until
someone breaks something,

20:54.650 --> 20:58.031
and that was expensive,
so we must be having a marvelous time.

20:59.029 --> 21:01.901
Darling, one of the waiters
said you were looking for me?

21:01.926 --> 21:05.424
- I need to speak to you. Privately.
- Of course.

21:08.882 --> 21:11.546
- You want to talk in here?
- It'll just be a moment.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.085
All right, what's-what's going on?

21:23.878 --> 21:25.278
Uh...

21:27.136 --> 21:28.671
Where did you get this?

21:28.696 --> 21:30.096
Does it matter?

21:31.546 --> 21:32.946
Who is he?

21:35.485 --> 21:38.525
- Darling, if I could just...
- Tell me his name.

21:42.721 --> 21:45.157
- Winston.
- What's his last name?

21:47.911 --> 21:49.561
I-I don't know.

21:53.460 --> 21:55.694
Is he the only one or
have there been others?

22:00.794 --> 22:02.428
Here's what's going to happen.

22:02.453 --> 22:04.467
You will go upstairs to begin packing.

22:04.492 --> 22:07.639
I will tell our guests that
you have some sort of headache.

22:08.529 --> 22:10.600
You won't come down
until everyone's gone.

22:12.319 --> 22:14.186
It's crucial they know nothing of this.

22:14.211 --> 22:16.577
Do you understand?
I will not be humiliated.

22:16.713 --> 22:18.522
- I'm s...
- Don't!

22:18.547 --> 22:20.022
I'm so sorry.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.983
You cannot apologize for this.

22:28.397 --> 22:32.491
I just don't think I'll be able to
find a new place in the next few days.

22:32.884 --> 22:34.582
I know. I told Eli.

22:43.788 --> 22:46.061
Are we gonna pretend I
didn't just catch you spying?

22:46.086 --> 22:48.296
That would be the polite
thing to do, yeah.

22:49.650 --> 22:51.050
Okay.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.838
- Everything okay with Jade?
- Mm-hmm.

22:56.079 --> 22:58.756
She was asking if she
could stay till Friday.

22:58.781 --> 23:01.218
- Taylor!
- I told her, "Not cool."

23:01.243 --> 23:02.643
She backed off.

23:03.352 --> 23:04.752
All right. Thank you.

23:06.243 --> 23:07.654
She does seem like a nice kid.

23:07.679 --> 23:09.256
Yeah, Jade's very nice.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.201
She's pretty, too. Don't you think?

23:14.326 --> 23:16.021
Yeah. Yeah, she's okay.

23:16.498 --> 23:20.209
- We don't lie to each other, remember?
- Okay, fine. She's spectacular.

23:20.234 --> 23:21.234
- Mm.
- You happy?

23:21.259 --> 23:22.659
- I am.
- Yeah.

23:24.301 --> 23:25.701
Oh...

23:29.534 --> 23:30.934
Mm.

23:32.654 --> 23:34.691
I got so lucky with you.

23:35.942 --> 23:37.808
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

23:38.509 --> 23:41.245
Most guys would not be down
with this kind of lifestyle.

23:42.075 --> 23:43.475
Well... you know...

23:43.912 --> 23:46.081
I get to have my fun, too. So.

23:47.622 --> 23:49.853
But you only agreed to this arrangement

23:49.878 --> 23:52.120
because you knew how
much it meant to me.

23:53.215 --> 23:54.964
So for that, I thank you.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.261
Are we gonna have sex now?

24:07.676 --> 24:08.906
Mm-hmm.

24:08.907 --> 24:11.403
Are you gonna be thinking about
Jade while we're doing it?

24:11.403 --> 24:12.803
Probably.

24:13.279 --> 24:14.679
Me, too.

24:22.020 --> 24:23.220
Hello?

24:23.370 --> 24:25.177
Honey, I hope you haven't
started dinner yet.

24:25.177 --> 24:27.159
I got to meet a client out for a drink.

24:27.938 --> 24:29.338
A client?

24:29.696 --> 24:32.269
It might go late, so... don't wait up.

24:33.006 --> 24:35.073
Oh, I'll make you a sandwich.

24:35.551 --> 24:37.270
It will be in the fridge
when you get home.

24:37.270 --> 24:39.441
Sounds great. Love you.

25:50.486 --> 25:51.887
Is everybody gone?

25:51.912 --> 25:53.653
Your mother was the last to leave.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.403
She said she'll see you at home.

25:55.428 --> 25:58.006
I, uh, finished cleaning the kitchen,
and everything's put away.

25:58.006 --> 26:00.778
Thank you.
Be sure to lock up before you leave.

26:01.446 --> 26:03.796
Is Mr. Grove okay?

26:06.060 --> 26:08.762
I mean, he never
came back down to the party.

26:09.890 --> 26:11.325
Don't you worry about him.

26:22.484 --> 26:26.036
Why aren't you finished packing?
I'm only seeing casual clothes.

26:26.061 --> 26:27.825
You'll need at least two suits.

26:28.122 --> 26:30.716
By the way,
I don't want anyone at the art gallery

26:30.740 --> 26:33.278
knowing about this.
Not until the divorce is final.

26:34.545 --> 26:35.800
Did you say something?

26:36.030 --> 26:38.905
I'm packing your Armani.
You'll need something black.

26:39.754 --> 26:41.280
Once we've gone public,

26:41.305 --> 26:43.394
you need to tell our
friends at the country club

26:43.398 --> 26:44.788
that this was amicable.

26:44.813 --> 26:47.498
I want to avoid as many
condescending looks as possible.

26:48.085 --> 26:51.577
Why are you mumbling?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

26:55.095 --> 26:56.495
Why are you sweating?

26:58.502 --> 26:59.902
Karl?

27:04.353 --> 27:05.779
What did you do?!

27:06.711 --> 27:09.552
You think you're gonna get out
of this by dying? Fuck you!

27:09.577 --> 27:12.952
I want to see you suffer in a one-bedroom
apartment next to the airport,

27:12.977 --> 27:15.444
and you will not deny me that pleasure!

27:16.564 --> 27:19.486
Hello? Yes.

27:19.511 --> 27:21.014
Uh, we've had a little incident.

27:21.039 --> 27:24.006
Can you send an
ambulance to 4352 Seneca?

27:24.031 --> 27:27.342
Yes, it's my husband. He seems to
have taken a few too many pills.

27:27.367 --> 27:29.037
Uh, could you hold?

27:29.709 --> 27:31.109
Wake up!

27:32.746 --> 27:34.226
Excuse me, I'm back.

27:34.370 --> 27:36.131
Oh, it's on its way?

27:36.339 --> 27:39.444
Oh, thank you so much.
My husband and I will be waiting.

27:48.953 --> 27:50.353
Karl.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.006
Karl...

28:06.695 --> 28:08.479
Something is weird.

28:08.632 --> 28:10.655
Our home is clean.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.080
Yeah.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.391
Isn't that weird?

28:14.613 --> 28:17.717
Hey!
I was just coming up to wake you guys.

28:17.924 --> 28:19.577
Did you clean our house?

28:19.795 --> 28:21.616
It was my way of saying thank you.

28:21.641 --> 28:24.041
Also, I ran to the store and
I got stuff for breakfast.

28:28.530 --> 28:30.030
Go ahead, sit down.

28:30.183 --> 28:33.592
The orange juice is freshly squeezed,
and I'm making pancakes.

28:33.617 --> 28:36.608
- Honey, you didn't have to do all this.
- Oh, I wanted to.

28:36.752 --> 28:38.600
Cooking relaxes me.

28:38.782 --> 28:40.256
Yeah, let her relax.

28:40.842 --> 28:42.242
Sit down.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.883
Wait a minute,
where did these plates come from?

28:46.883 --> 28:48.655
It's our good china.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.984
- So lovely.
- Yeah.

28:51.365 --> 28:52.803
Why don't we ever use it?

28:53.233 --> 28:54.951
I don't know where we keep it.

28:57.871 --> 28:59.372
Jade.

28:59.397 --> 29:02.622
She cooks, she cleans, she juices...

29:03.027 --> 29:05.918
- She's the wife we always wanted.
- Yeah.

29:06.205 --> 29:07.605
Mm-hmm.

29:08.203 --> 29:10.646
Do you ever wish I were more like this?

29:11.120 --> 29:13.771
Cooking your breakfast
and pouring your coffee?

29:13.796 --> 29:15.130
I married a kick-ass lawyer.

29:15.155 --> 29:16.671
That's better than
having my coffee poured.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.071
Good answer.

29:18.608 --> 29:20.771
How about you?
Ever...

29:21.111 --> 29:23.286
resent me for not
bringing home more money?

29:24.308 --> 29:26.086
It's been a while since I sold a script.

29:26.912 --> 29:28.312
You're trying.

29:28.894 --> 29:31.896
But the last two years,
you've been the breadwinner.

29:33.138 --> 29:34.552
That never bothers you?

29:39.472 --> 29:40.872
Here we go.

29:43.319 --> 29:44.719
Do you like bacon?

29:45.462 --> 29:48.826
Uh... well, I'm Jewish, so, yeah.

29:58.127 --> 30:00.451
The meat loaf's delicious.

30:00.765 --> 30:02.177
Did you change the recipe?

30:04.123 --> 30:06.849
- Little bit.
- Well, good job.

30:06.874 --> 30:08.274
Better than ever.

30:11.589 --> 30:13.005
Penny for your thoughts.

30:14.153 --> 30:16.044
Oh, I was just...

30:16.943 --> 30:18.343
thinking about...

30:19.001 --> 30:20.310
silly things.

30:20.335 --> 30:21.771
What kind of silly things?

30:24.459 --> 30:26.417
I was wondering when you'll die.

30:29.650 --> 30:31.129
Excuse me?

30:31.752 --> 30:35.279
Oh... Whether it will be
sooner rather than later.

30:35.878 --> 30:38.154
I'm not dying anytime soon.

30:38.322 --> 30:39.880
You don't know that.

30:41.426 --> 30:43.080
You could be hit by a bus.

30:43.105 --> 30:45.630
Or have a stroke, or get...

30:45.783 --> 30:47.183
stabbed in the chest.

30:48.546 --> 30:49.974
Beth Ann.

30:50.553 --> 30:54.482
Myra Penn's husband was 50
when he choked to death on a pimento.

30:54.636 --> 30:57.864
I'm only 42, and I feel great.

30:57.889 --> 31:00.793
Can we just... eat dinner?

31:05.332 --> 31:07.254
I put pimentos in the meat loaf.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.028
That's how I changed the recipe.

31:13.266 --> 31:15.145
Are you angry with me?

31:15.815 --> 31:17.168
Why would you say that?

31:17.193 --> 31:19.723
You're fantasizing about
my death, for starters.

31:19.748 --> 31:21.369
Oh, I don't wish you dead.

31:21.849 --> 31:24.822
I'm just wondering
what will become of me

31:24.847 --> 31:26.587
when the inevitable happens.

31:27.556 --> 31:29.111
Inevitable?

31:29.585 --> 31:31.065
I don't have a job.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.673
Or a hobby.

31:33.203 --> 31:35.861
All I do is take care of you.

31:36.351 --> 31:38.571
That's what makes you a good wife.

31:38.951 --> 31:41.337
But when you're not here anymore,

31:43.243 --> 31:44.665
who will I be?

31:47.901 --> 31:49.301
My widow?

31:50.870 --> 31:52.872
Listen to what I'm saying.

31:55.512 --> 31:57.361
I need something more.

31:57.878 --> 31:59.290
Like what?

32:00.547 --> 32:02.408
I don't know, exactly.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.954
This something more...

32:06.955 --> 32:11.204
will it keep you from
making me delicious dinners?

32:11.655 --> 32:12.790
No.

32:12.815 --> 32:17.244
Then you have my permission
to do whatever makes you happy.

32:20.294 --> 32:21.728
But just so you know...

32:22.879 --> 32:26.962
I intend on sticking around for a while.

32:32.834 --> 32:34.369
Okay.

32:49.736 --> 32:51.136
What is it?

32:51.400 --> 32:52.800
Pimento.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.200
Sorry.

33:05.711 --> 33:07.760
Ma'am, do you want
to ride with us to the hospital?

33:07.760 --> 33:09.813
Yes. But give me a moment.

33:10.736 --> 33:13.235
- Margaret.
- Simone, what happened?

33:13.260 --> 33:16.649
Oh, it was the silliest thing.
Karl slipped coming down the stairs.

33:16.947 --> 33:19.305
Nothing to worry about.
He just hit his head.

33:19.330 --> 33:22.422
Oh, Harold. I love the robe.

33:22.447 --> 33:27.360
- Uh, so Karl's okay?
- He's fine. Go on home. Don't mind us.

33:30.539 --> 33:31.962
We're almost ready to go, ma'am.

33:32.429 --> 33:34.649
Uh... just be a moment.

33:37.438 --> 33:38.838
Wanda.

33:39.273 --> 33:40.907
What are you doing here?

33:40.932 --> 33:42.961
I heard the sirens.

33:42.986 --> 33:45.094
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

33:45.119 --> 33:47.844
Karl just had a little fall
coming down the stairs.

33:48.198 --> 33:50.477
You sure you didn't push him?

33:52.535 --> 33:53.938
I wouldn't blame you.

33:53.963 --> 33:55.363
Considering.

33:58.826 --> 34:00.479
You left that photo.

34:05.148 --> 34:06.368
Oh, my God!

34:06.661 --> 34:07.884
Hey! Hey!

34:08.230 --> 34:10.766
Stop! Hey. Stop.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.289
Bitch!

34:14.314 --> 34:15.438
Oh!

34:15.463 --> 34:18.066
- Have you lost your mind?
- Of course not.

34:18.702 --> 34:20.102
I'm drunk.

34:26.235 --> 34:28.833
Hey.
I brought wine.

34:29.336 --> 34:31.352
Sheila, you didn't need to do that.

34:31.377 --> 34:34.672
Well, I wanted to see how you were doing
and I couldn't come empty-handed.

34:37.214 --> 34:39.469
I went to that diner, and...

34:40.682 --> 34:42.953
I saw Rob kiss the waitress.

34:43.800 --> 34:47.352
Oh, honey.
You sit and I'll pour.

34:52.502 --> 34:54.633
I've decided not to say anything.

34:55.404 --> 34:58.890
If I put Rob on the defensive,
it will affect our marriage.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.490
He's committing adultery.

35:01.515 --> 35:03.835
That's supposed to affect your marriage.

35:03.860 --> 35:07.132
I'm just going to work
harder at being a good wife.

35:07.833 --> 35:10.268
To remind Rob why he loves me.

35:11.124 --> 35:13.526
And then, hopefully...

35:14.974 --> 35:16.643
There is another option.

35:17.179 --> 35:19.588
- What's that?
- Confront the girl.

35:20.550 --> 35:23.112
- The girl?
- Go to her diner and make a scene.

35:23.137 --> 35:26.041
Sheila. She might not even
know that Rob is married.

35:26.066 --> 35:27.940
Oh, those tramps always know.

35:27.965 --> 35:30.752
Threaten to tell her boss
unless she stops seeing Rob.

35:30.777 --> 35:32.791
Scare her to death.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.010
I suppose that could work.

35:39.407 --> 35:42.229
But I just don't know where
I would find the courage.

35:42.254 --> 35:45.932
It's right here,
at the bottom of this glass.

35:56.712 --> 35:58.276
This is your wife's lover?

35:59.278 --> 36:00.498
Yeah.

36:00.655 --> 36:02.055
Damn.

36:02.251 --> 36:04.229
- Ooh, she got game.
- Mm-hmm.

36:04.821 --> 36:07.604
Oh, and get this: Jade.

36:07.629 --> 36:09.109
Total neat freak.

36:09.134 --> 36:12.497
Spent the last two days compulsively
cleaning our entire house.

36:12.522 --> 36:15.067
And she cooks and she does laundry.

36:15.754 --> 36:18.161
She sewed this button on
my shirt this morning.

36:18.186 --> 36:20.622
So she's into some
serious housewife shit.

36:20.647 --> 36:23.051
Oh, man, I got to tell you,
it's addictive.

36:23.160 --> 36:25.192
Like, having a woman
wait on me like this?

36:25.971 --> 36:27.559
Bringing out my inner caveman.

36:28.677 --> 36:31.841
So, um, what else is Jade into?

36:32.532 --> 36:34.278
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know me.

36:34.303 --> 36:36.630
I hear about a sexy
lady who lives to serve,

36:36.655 --> 36:39.278
- my imagination runs wild.
- No, no, no, no. No.

36:39.303 --> 36:41.317
She's my wife's lover, not mine.

36:41.396 --> 36:44.387
Well, I would now like to say
the two most beautiful words

36:44.412 --> 36:45.812
in the English language:

36:46.312 --> 36:47.712
three-way.

36:47.840 --> 36:51.301
- Technically, that's one word.
- Don't hit me with that hyphen bullshit.

36:51.326 --> 36:52.983
- I'm trying to get you laid, bitch.
- All right.

36:52.983 --> 36:55.028
Taylor and I,
we've never done that before.

36:55.550 --> 36:57.652
You don't need to train for it.

36:57.677 --> 37:00.402
It's sex, not ice dancing.

37:01.410 --> 37:04.230
You already got an open marriage.
What's the big deal?

37:04.255 --> 37:07.019
Well, to begin with, I don't know
that Jade's that into me.

37:07.044 --> 37:09.191
She sewed a button on for you.

37:09.432 --> 37:11.949
That's how white girls say "Fuck me."

37:12.017 --> 37:14.780
- You're crazy.
- Look, I know what I know.

37:40.613 --> 37:44.871
Hi. I'm April.
I'll be your waitress this morning.

37:48.168 --> 37:50.363
Um, can I get you some coffee to start?

37:55.179 --> 37:56.579
Ma'am?

38:05.127 --> 38:06.527
Are you okay?

38:09.938 --> 38:11.418
I'm sorry.

38:11.821 --> 38:13.221
Here.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.144
I don't know what is wrong with me.

38:21.169 --> 38:22.800
We all have bad days.

38:23.599 --> 38:24.999
I know I have.

38:27.131 --> 38:29.886
You seem like a very nice girl.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.394
I try to be.

38:37.795 --> 38:39.973
You know, I'm not really
that hungry. I should go.

38:39.974 --> 38:41.818
Oh, at least let me get
you a cup of coffee.

38:41.818 --> 38:43.218
It's all right.

38:44.877 --> 38:46.277
Ma'am?

38:46.535 --> 38:47.735
Um...

38:48.373 --> 38:50.154
You look like you could
use someone to talk to.

38:50.154 --> 38:51.754
And we're slow right now.

38:51.916 --> 38:53.902
- I could sit with you for a bit.
- No.

38:54.177 --> 38:55.379
You don't have to do that.

38:55.404 --> 38:58.284
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.
You can tell me about your life,

38:58.309 --> 39:01.393
I'll tell you about mine,
and then, we'll be friends.

39:03.117 --> 39:04.879
Now, wouldn't you like that?

39:11.062 --> 39:15.260
I suppose I could stay a few minutes.

39:15.863 --> 39:17.063
Sure.

39:17.189 --> 39:18.956
I am so glad.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.381
Come on.

39:23.739 --> 39:25.799
Um, sorry.

39:25.824 --> 39:28.495
Uh, what was your name?

39:31.829 --> 39:33.029
Sheila.

39:34.056 --> 39:36.448
My name is Sheila.

39:49.543 --> 39:51.057
Door's open.

39:55.746 --> 39:57.146
Hey, Mrs. Grove.

39:58.085 --> 39:59.285
What's all this?

39:59.403 --> 40:01.956
These are a few of my favorite things.

40:02.697 --> 40:06.190
Well, my mom told me that Mr. Grove
went to the hospital last night.

40:06.215 --> 40:08.522
I just wanted to see how he was doing.

40:08.889 --> 40:11.299
He'll be there a few days,
but he'll recover.

40:13.310 --> 40:14.548
Anything else?

40:14.701 --> 40:16.101
Um...

40:17.356 --> 40:21.969
Yeah, actually, um,
I wanted to apologize.

40:22.318 --> 40:23.718
For what?

40:24.068 --> 40:26.114
I lied to you last night.

40:26.665 --> 40:28.843
I saw the photo of your husband

40:28.868 --> 40:31.687
and his... friend.

40:31.979 --> 40:35.828
I-I didn't know what to do, so I
put the photo back in the envelope.

40:36.583 --> 40:40.637
- Well, did you tell your mother about this?
- No. No.

40:42.325 --> 40:44.812
She'll find out eventually,
I just can't handle that.

40:45.564 --> 40:47.040
Not just yet.

40:48.072 --> 40:50.000
So is Mr. Grove gay?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.062
Oh, yeah.

40:57.645 --> 40:59.342
I am so sorry.

41:05.433 --> 41:08.741
It's funny, my first husband
liked booze more than me.

41:08.766 --> 41:13.006
My second liked cocaine more than me.
My third likes boys more than me.

41:13.517 --> 41:15.624
Am I the only one here seeing a pattern?

41:20.972 --> 41:23.139
Maybe you just haven't
met the right man yet.

41:24.422 --> 41:28.217
I've always thought of myself
as this fabulous woman.

41:29.620 --> 41:33.952
But how fabulous can I be
if nobody wants to love me?

41:37.899 --> 41:39.299
Hey...

41:44.844 --> 41:46.244
Come here.

42:05.849 --> 42:07.249
Tommy.

42:08.786 --> 42:11.241
I've wanted to do that since I was 13.

42:11.266 --> 42:14.174
- Well, how old are you now?
- I'm 18.

42:16.601 --> 42:18.039
In two days.

42:19.251 --> 42:20.469
As much as it would cheer me up

42:20.469 --> 42:22.374
to commit a felony,
I think you should go.

42:27.342 --> 42:28.542
Okay.

42:35.545 --> 42:36.945
Just remember,

42:38.332 --> 42:41.163
there's at least one man in this
world who's dying to fuck you.

43:05.009 --> 43:06.209
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:06.234 --> 43:08.774
Are you working on something?
'Cause I wanted to go swim,

43:08.775 --> 43:11.857
- but if it would bother you...
- No, no, no. No, no. No, you swim.

43:11.882 --> 43:15.318
I will just be here only
looking at my computer.

43:23.921 --> 43:27.779
So, I found out that you and I
have the same taste in movies.

43:27.804 --> 43:29.404
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

43:29.429 --> 43:33.052
Um, that poster, framed on the wall?
Jenny From Yesterday?

43:33.476 --> 43:34.927
I love that movie.

43:35.338 --> 43:36.974
- You do?
- Yeah.

43:37.114 --> 43:38.834
I saw it four times.

43:38.859 --> 43:40.427
It made me cry.

43:41.096 --> 43:42.732
I guess you love it, too?

43:42.950 --> 43:47.208
Uh, well, yeah, I'm, I'm-I'm partial,
but mostly just 'cause I wrote it.

43:49.030 --> 43:50.276
No!

43:50.314 --> 43:52.537
Yeah, yeah. I'm Eli Cohen.

43:52.562 --> 43:55.576
My name's right there in the credits.

43:55.939 --> 43:58.505
I never pay attention
to who writes the movie.

43:59.555 --> 44:01.255
You'll do well in Hollywood.

44:01.280 --> 44:03.513
God, this is crazy.
I can't believe this.

44:03.538 --> 44:06.029
I'm staying with the guy
who wrote my favorite movie.

44:06.054 --> 44:07.343
It's not your favorite movie.

44:07.351 --> 44:09.339
- It totally is.
- No...

44:09.364 --> 44:11.062
And I'm not the only
person who feels that way.

44:11.062 --> 44:14.205
There's, like, a ton of people
who worship that movie.

44:15.456 --> 44:17.408
You must be so proud of yourself.

44:17.433 --> 44:19.228
Please, please stop. Okay?

44:19.253 --> 44:21.103
- You're embarrassing me.
- No.

44:21.594 --> 44:23.422
I think it's incredible.

44:23.762 --> 44:26.674
Get used to it.
You're really, really special.

44:46.822 --> 44:48.022
Hey.

44:48.583 --> 44:49.805
Hey.

44:50.059 --> 44:52.416
I was in court today for
seven hours straight.

44:52.441 --> 44:55.058
- It was a shit-show.
- Woof.

44:55.580 --> 44:56.912
Well, you know what?

44:56.937 --> 44:58.715
We'll have some wine
with dinner tonight.

44:58.806 --> 45:00.774
- You'll relax.
- Sounds wonderful.

45:01.656 --> 45:02.977
So I was thinking,

45:03.002 --> 45:07.462
if Jade needed to stay here
a couple extra weeks,

45:07.949 --> 45:09.349
it's no problem.

45:09.475 --> 45:11.571
Honey, you would do that for me?

45:11.739 --> 45:14.930
Hey, you know me.
I'm all about being a nice guy.

45:24.667 --> 45:26.821
It's a simple question, really.

45:27.097 --> 45:28.907
Why would a woman kill?

45:29.249 --> 45:31.032
And who would she murder?

45:31.057 --> 45:32.735
The man who did her wrong?

45:32.760 --> 45:34.204
The other woman?

45:34.229 --> 45:37.165
Perhaps a friend guilty of betrayal?

45:37.266 --> 45:40.384
To know the answer,
you must listen to the woman's story.

45:40.409 --> 45:42.321
Discover her secrets.

45:42.346 --> 45:45.540
Only then can you understand
the choices she made.

45:45.565 --> 45:46.876
You might condemn her.

45:46.901 --> 45:48.381
You might forgive her.

45:48.406 --> 45:51.399
You might think you'd have
done the exact same thing.

45:51.550 --> 45:53.430
But for the woman who kills,

45:53.712 --> 45:55.821
only one question really matters.

45:56.141 --> 45:58.032
Does she get away with it?

45:59.730 --> 46:04.730
