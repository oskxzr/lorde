00:08.847 --> 00:10.951
<i>Previously on</i> Why Women Kill...

00:11.034 --> 00:13.245
Fuck!

00:14.371 --> 00:16.248
I-I know that it looks bad.

00:16.331 --> 00:18.125
You're going to rehab
first thing in the morning.

00:18.208 --> 00:19.460
You are cut off.

00:19.543 --> 00:20.794
I-I-I don't think
it's the best time

00:20.878 --> 00:22.087
for me right now.

00:22.171 --> 00:23.630
You don't really
have a choice here.

00:23.714 --> 00:25.966
I just sold a script
for $1.2 million.

00:26.049 --> 00:28.969
- You know, I think I got a lot of fucking choices.
- Come on, Jade.

00:29.052 --> 00:31.513
I think maybe
the best way to help him

00:31.597 --> 00:33.640
- is to stay here.
- Fuck you both.

00:35.225 --> 00:36.643
<i>Uh, I have an appointment.</i>

00:36.727 --> 00:38.145
<i>And would this appointment</i>

00:38.228 --> 00:39.563
involve your new boyfriend
Hector?

00:39.646 --> 00:41.482
He may tag along, yes.

00:41.565 --> 00:44.443
I, uh, leave for Paris
two days after graduation.

00:44.526 --> 00:45.861
Care to join me?

00:45.944 --> 00:48.071
- You should go.
- You'll be okay?

00:48.155 --> 00:49.364
I'll be delightful.

00:54.411 --> 00:55.829
You've got get over
this obsession

00:55.913 --> 00:56.955
with another woman's husband.

00:57.039 --> 00:58.290
I'm pregnant.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.502
How do you think he'll react?

01:01.585 --> 01:03.837
- He will be thrilled.
- Come clean.

01:03.921 --> 01:05.964
Tell him you know about
the affair and the baby.

01:06.048 --> 01:07.549
What if...

01:07.633 --> 01:09.343
he doesn't choose me?

01:09.426 --> 01:12.638
Aren't you done
with all the lies?

01:12.721 --> 01:15.390
- We definitely need to have a talk.
- You're starting to scare me.

01:15.474 --> 01:16.725
I'm scared, too.

01:16.809 --> 01:18.310
<i>Once I tell you,</i>

01:18.393 --> 01:20.020
everything is going
to be different.

01:20.103 --> 01:21.605
Are you sick?

01:22.606 --> 01:23.732
I'm sick.

01:23.816 --> 01:24.858
Baby, what's wrong?

01:24.942 --> 01:26.318
I have cancer.

01:26.401 --> 01:28.737
Oh, my... oh, my God.

02:43.186 --> 02:45.105
I'm going to die.

02:45.188 --> 02:47.232
I'm not sure when.

02:47.316 --> 02:50.485
I just know
one day I won't be here.

02:50.569 --> 02:52.446
I'm afraid to meet God.

02:52.529 --> 02:54.281
I'll have to account
for my sins.

02:54.364 --> 02:56.491
I have sinned a lot.

02:56.575 --> 02:58.952
I had an affair
with a married man.

02:59.036 --> 03:00.954
I slept with another guy's wife.

03:01.038 --> 03:03.582
I had sex with a married couple

03:03.665 --> 03:06.585
and pretty much everyone else
I ever met.

03:06.668 --> 03:08.962
Now I'm pregnant and unmarried.

03:09.046 --> 03:11.673
My mom has no idea
I've fallen in love.

03:11.757 --> 03:14.426
Taylor doesn't know
I gave Eli drugs.

03:14.509 --> 03:16.511
I'm not going to tell Rob.

03:16.595 --> 03:18.805
I'm gonna propose to Simone.

03:18.889 --> 03:21.099
I'll probably deny everything.

03:21.183 --> 03:25.020
When I do meet God,
I'll just beg his forgiveness.

03:25.103 --> 03:28.106
I'll thank him for sending me
the perfect woman.

03:28.190 --> 03:31.109
I'll say I did what I had to

03:31.193 --> 03:33.153
to survive.

03:42.704 --> 03:43.830
Sheila.

03:43.914 --> 03:45.832
Oh, my God.

03:45.916 --> 03:49.336
I've been on pins and needles.
Did you talk to Rob last night?

03:49.419 --> 03:50.337
I did.

03:50.420 --> 03:52.965
So? I'm dying here.

03:53.048 --> 03:54.967
How did he react
when you told him

03:55.050 --> 03:56.843
you knew that he was
cheating on you?

03:56.927 --> 03:58.804
Well,

03:58.887 --> 04:03.016
the conversation went
in a surprising direction.

04:05.435 --> 04:08.188
You said what?
You said what?

04:08.271 --> 04:09.815
What? How could
you say that?

04:09.898 --> 04:11.400
How could you say
that, Beth Ann?

04:11.483 --> 04:13.986
What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

04:14.069 --> 04:16.154
I can't even believe
you just said that!

04:16.238 --> 04:18.407
Get back here
so I can give it to you!

04:21.284 --> 04:23.203
It's your mother's fault.

04:23.287 --> 04:26.373
Clearly, she forgot to teach
you some of the basics.

04:26.456 --> 04:31.044
Things like, when you grow up,
don't pretend to have cancer.

04:31.128 --> 04:34.339
Women lie to
their husbands every day.

04:34.423 --> 04:36.091
Some lie about
how much they spend.

04:36.174 --> 04:38.176
My lie's that I'm dying.

04:38.260 --> 04:40.053
Just because
you act classy

04:40.137 --> 04:42.055
doesn't mean you're
not fucking crazy.

04:42.139 --> 04:43.932
There is a method
to my madness.

04:44.016 --> 04:46.560
Rob will never leave me
while I'm sick.

04:46.643 --> 04:48.603
But what if April decides

04:48.687 --> 04:51.106
to tell him that
she's having his kid?

04:51.189 --> 04:54.067
That is where her good friend
Sheila comes in.

04:54.151 --> 04:56.069
I'm going to convince her
to leave town.

04:56.153 --> 04:58.447
Start a new life,
sever the tie for good.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.240
And then, once she's out
of the picture

05:00.323 --> 05:01.742
and I have Rob
all to myself,

05:01.825 --> 05:05.704
my cancer will be
miraculously cured.

05:05.787 --> 05:08.123
I used to find
that little grin charming.

05:08.206 --> 05:10.208
Now it just scares
the shit out of me.

05:10.292 --> 05:11.752
Ladies.

05:11.835 --> 05:13.879
The doctor will see you now.

05:15.005 --> 05:16.923
Enzo.

05:17.007 --> 05:18.759
Aunt Sheila.

05:18.842 --> 05:20.802
Look at you in the white coat.

05:20.886 --> 05:23.555
This is my neighbor,
Beth Ann Stanton.

05:23.638 --> 05:26.183
Beth Ann, my nephew, Enzo.
The doctor.

05:26.266 --> 05:28.185
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Stanton.

05:28.268 --> 05:30.270
Likewise.

05:32.731 --> 05:34.900
So, Sheila says
you studied oncology.

05:34.983 --> 05:36.568
For a little while,

05:36.651 --> 05:38.904
- and then I switched to hematology.
- Oh, still,

05:38.987 --> 05:41.615
I bet you remember lots
of useful tidbits.

05:41.698 --> 05:44.117
I suppose so.
How can I help you?

05:44.201 --> 05:45.786
Well, I was wondering

05:45.869 --> 05:49.081
if there was a cancer
you could recommend.

05:50.332 --> 05:51.792
- Recommend?
- Something rare.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.460
That no one's ever heard of.

05:53.543 --> 05:54.628
It should be serious.

05:54.711 --> 05:56.588
Oh, but occasionally curable.

05:56.671 --> 05:59.257
I'm sorry...

05:59.341 --> 06:01.551
And symptoms. She's gonna need symptoms.

06:01.635 --> 06:03.804
Oh, some symptoms
would be lovely.

06:03.887 --> 06:06.598
Just wait a...

06:06.681 --> 06:08.475
What exactly
are we talking about here?

06:08.558 --> 06:09.935
Enzo.

06:10.018 --> 06:14.523
I say this to you as your aunt
and a Sicilian:

06:14.606 --> 06:17.150
The less you know, the better.

06:17.234 --> 06:19.778
Okay.

06:19.861 --> 06:21.488
Um, rare cancers.

06:24.241 --> 06:26.535
What about...

06:26.618 --> 06:30.330
Epithelioid
hemangioendothelioma.

06:30.413 --> 06:32.165
Say that again.

06:32.249 --> 06:33.834
I'd rather not.

06:33.917 --> 06:36.169
That's the cancer you have?

06:36.253 --> 06:38.171
It affects soft tissue.

06:38.255 --> 06:39.673
I'd give you the details,

06:39.756 --> 06:41.675
but they're disgusting
and we're having fondue.

06:43.552 --> 06:47.139
God, I wish you'd let me go
to the doctor's with you.

06:47.222 --> 06:48.974
You always get
so emotional.

06:49.057 --> 06:52.185
No. I prefer to go
with Sheila.

06:52.269 --> 06:54.146
Now, I'm going to set the table.

06:54.229 --> 06:57.190
Wait. Wait.
At least tell me your prognosis.

06:57.274 --> 06:59.526
I will, but I don't want
to ruin our meal.

06:59.609 --> 07:01.528
Beth Ann!
Please, just tell me!

07:01.611 --> 07:04.573
Fine.

07:04.656 --> 07:07.993
But I need you to be strong.

07:08.076 --> 07:11.037
Can you do that for me, Robert?
Can you be my brave boy?

07:11.121 --> 07:13.206
Yeah.

07:13.290 --> 07:15.208
Well,

07:15.292 --> 07:18.420
it seems I only have
six months to live.

07:19.421 --> 07:20.714
Six months!

07:20.797 --> 07:22.757
But that doesn't mean
I can't recover.

07:22.841 --> 07:26.219
Miracles happen every day.

07:26.303 --> 07:29.890
But the doctor feels
we should prepare for the worst.

07:29.973 --> 07:32.100
It sounds like
he's giving up already.

07:32.184 --> 07:33.768
We should get a second opinion.

07:33.852 --> 07:38.273
No. I mean, what is
another doctor going to say?

07:38.356 --> 07:40.108
I don't have cancer?

07:40.192 --> 07:44.571
No, this is the situation,
and we all must accept it.

07:44.654 --> 07:45.947
Okay?

07:46.031 --> 07:47.574
Okay.

07:47.657 --> 07:51.411
Now, obviously, if I'm going
to fight this thing,

07:51.494 --> 07:54.664
I need you by my side.

07:54.748 --> 07:56.958
Constantly.

08:00.462 --> 08:02.380
I'm not going anywhere.

08:02.464 --> 08:03.590
You're my wife.

08:03.673 --> 08:05.926
I meant it when I said,

08:06.009 --> 08:07.844
"Till death do us part."

08:09.095 --> 08:11.556
Oh, my darling.

08:13.016 --> 08:16.144
I'm going to hold you to that.

08:17.354 --> 08:18.897
This is hard.

08:18.980 --> 08:21.107
I've never packed
for a three-month trip before.

08:21.191 --> 08:22.901
Oh, packing for three months
is easy.

08:22.984 --> 08:25.779
I do it every time
I go away for the weekend.

08:25.862 --> 08:28.406
These look sturdy.
Should I try them on?

08:28.490 --> 08:29.908
Knock yourself out.

08:32.577 --> 08:35.997
Hey, I know we agreed that you'd
fly to Paris a week after me,

08:36.081 --> 08:37.874
but wouldn't three days
be enough?

08:37.958 --> 08:39.793
Or even two?

08:39.876 --> 08:41.962
You can't wait one week?

08:42.045 --> 08:44.798
We need as much time
for sex as possible.

08:44.881 --> 08:46.758
Remember, you said you'd
make love to me in

08:46.841 --> 08:48.260
every city in Europe.
What am I supposed

08:48.343 --> 08:50.095
to do on my own
for a whole week?

08:50.178 --> 08:51.471
Beat it.

08:51.554 --> 08:52.973
That's cold.

08:53.056 --> 08:55.183
Oh, not you.

08:55.267 --> 08:57.185
What do you think?
Do you like them?

08:57.269 --> 08:59.020
Oh, what are all
the pockets for?

08:59.104 --> 09:00.188
Carrying stuff.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.190
They'll be great
for hiking over the Alps.

09:02.274 --> 09:04.109
- Hiking over the Alps?
- Yeah.

09:04.192 --> 09:07.112
Good Lord, are we taking a
vacation or fleeing the Nazis?

09:12.951 --> 09:16.162
I'm starting to think that we're
imagining very different trips.

09:16.246 --> 09:18.957
Well, I want our vacation
to be elegant, romantic.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.959
Nights at
la Comédie-Française,

09:21.042 --> 09:22.335
dinner at Maxim's.

09:22.419 --> 09:24.170
Yeah, well, I can't
afford those things.

09:24.254 --> 09:26.006
Oh, well,
if that's the problem...

09:26.089 --> 09:27.799
No, I know you can
afford those things,

09:27.882 --> 09:30.677
but I-I don't want to
feel like your gigolo.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.138
- I have an idea.
- What?

09:33.221 --> 09:36.224
Return my brooch
and get your money back.

09:36.308 --> 09:39.519
What you spent on it can buy
a whole lot of escargot.

09:39.602 --> 09:42.355
I bought you this to show you
what you mean to me.

09:42.439 --> 09:44.357
Well, find another way
to show me.

09:44.441 --> 09:45.692
Like what?

09:45.775 --> 09:46.860
You're an artist.

09:46.943 --> 09:48.820
Use your imagination.

09:55.785 --> 09:57.912
Okay.

09:57.996 --> 10:00.457
I'll see what I can
come up with.

10:06.963 --> 10:08.423
Taylor.

10:08.506 --> 10:09.716
What are you doing here?

10:10.925 --> 10:12.635
Can we talk for a sec?

10:17.766 --> 10:22.604
My mom got sick when I was ten.

10:22.687 --> 10:26.858
From that point on, it was
just us, so I had to step up.

10:26.941 --> 10:29.903
But it was good, because
I learned to take charge.

10:29.986 --> 10:31.905
I found out I could
figure out the solution

10:31.988 --> 10:33.782
to any problem
that came my way.

10:33.865 --> 10:36.242
Until last night.

10:38.328 --> 10:41.915
I sat in that hotel room
until dawn

10:41.998 --> 10:45.877
trying to figure out
how to fix this thing with Eli.

10:48.004 --> 10:49.923
And I just can't.

10:50.006 --> 10:52.133
I'm so sorry.

10:52.217 --> 10:54.594
You know, when Eli
O.D.'d last time,

10:54.677 --> 10:56.429
I knew exactly what to do.

10:56.513 --> 11:00.016
I got him into rehab,
I paid off his debts.

11:01.684 --> 11:04.604
But I think that a part of him
always resented me

11:04.687 --> 11:07.273
for managing the situation
in a way that he couldn't.

11:07.357 --> 11:10.443
And now he's just
so angry at me.

11:10.527 --> 11:14.447
And I don't think
he'll let me help him.

11:14.531 --> 11:17.534
And I'm so scared of what
will happen if I can't.

11:17.617 --> 11:19.786
Eli is not going to die.

11:19.869 --> 11:22.580
He will
if he doesn't stop using.

11:24.582 --> 11:27.961
But the good news is
he still listens to you.

11:28.044 --> 11:30.255
So I am begging you. Please.

11:30.338 --> 11:31.756
You are my last hope.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.133
Of course, yes. Totally.

11:33.216 --> 11:35.427
I'm totally with you.
I promise.

11:35.510 --> 11:38.805
Thank God. You have no idea
how much that means to me.

11:40.598 --> 11:42.851
Okay.

11:42.934 --> 11:46.646
We have to move fast, before the
money comes in for Eli's script.

11:46.729 --> 11:49.107
You're worried he's gonna
spend it all on drugs?

11:49.190 --> 11:50.942
Not just drugs.

11:51.025 --> 11:53.278
When Eli's using,
he gets stupid generous.

11:53.361 --> 11:56.322
- Stupid generous?
- Oh, yeah.

11:56.406 --> 11:58.158
The last time,
he bought gifts for everyone.

11:58.241 --> 12:00.452
Rolex watches, designer shoes.

12:00.535 --> 12:03.455
When he's high, he just wants
everyone to be as happy

12:03.538 --> 12:05.623
as he is.

12:05.707 --> 12:07.333
So, I've been thinking of ways

12:07.417 --> 12:11.045
that we can handle this
covertly.

12:11.129 --> 12:15.133
And I have one idea, but it...
it's kind of crazy.

12:15.216 --> 12:17.343
I like crazy.

12:17.427 --> 12:19.554
The next time
Eli's in the shower,

12:19.637 --> 12:23.808
I need you to go into his phone
and find all of his passwords.

12:25.059 --> 12:26.144
What?

12:26.227 --> 12:28.021
The code to his phone
is 0-4-2-9.

12:28.104 --> 12:30.023
Just here, look,
I wrote it down for you.

12:30.106 --> 12:32.025
If we can get access

12:32.108 --> 12:34.027
to his his business accounts
and his credit cards,

12:34.110 --> 12:35.528
we can cut off
his cash flow.

12:35.612 --> 12:36.696
Oh.

12:36.779 --> 12:38.156
And I'm gonna call his dad.

12:38.239 --> 12:40.033
How will that help?

12:40.116 --> 12:41.701
Eli is terrified of his dad.

12:41.784 --> 12:44.746
Jake will force him to admit
who got him using again.

12:46.498 --> 12:48.875
Why does that matter?

12:48.958 --> 12:50.668
He was clean
for two years,

12:50.752 --> 12:51.878
and then suddenly he's not?

12:51.961 --> 12:53.546
No, I need to know
what happened.

12:54.589 --> 12:55.924
Of course.

12:56.007 --> 12:58.176
And I want to help,
but is this really

12:58.259 --> 13:00.887
- the best plan?
- What do you mean?

13:00.970 --> 13:02.472
Look, you remember how you felt
when you thought

13:02.555 --> 13:04.057
that Eli and I were
ganging up on you.

13:04.140 --> 13:05.892
How is he gonna feel
if it... if it seems

13:05.975 --> 13:07.393
like we're ganging up on him?

13:07.477 --> 13:08.895
So what do you propose we do?

13:08.978 --> 13:11.648
Give me a few days
and I'll reason with him.

13:11.731 --> 13:13.608
You really think
you can talk him into this?

13:13.691 --> 13:16.361
Trust me.
I'll get through to him,

13:16.444 --> 13:18.404
he'll come home,

13:18.488 --> 13:20.615
and we'll all be a family again.

13:23.701 --> 13:26.037
Look who's here!

13:26.120 --> 13:29.123
- Karl, it's the Sitwells!
- You're back from Scotland, I see.

13:29.207 --> 13:31.417
And we're meeting Rex
and Julie for dinner.

13:31.501 --> 13:32.794
They should be
here any second.

13:32.877 --> 13:34.629
Oh, I love her.
She thinks I'm pretty.

13:34.712 --> 13:36.714
We all think you're pretty.

13:36.798 --> 13:38.758
But she says it out loud.

13:39.634 --> 13:41.302
Tell you what...
when they get here,

13:41.386 --> 13:42.887
why don't you bring them over
to our table?

13:42.971 --> 13:43.888
We'll dine together.

13:43.972 --> 13:46.182
Wonderful. Then you can
tell us about your plans

13:46.266 --> 13:48.101
for Amy's
lavish wedding.

13:48.184 --> 13:50.436
We're so excited.
We can't wait.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.105
- Mm.
- I can't wait, either.

13:53.398 --> 13:54.691
For it to be over.

13:54.774 --> 13:56.568
Yes, I was thinking
the same thing.

13:56.651 --> 13:58.069
Oof, are we terrible people?

13:58.152 --> 13:59.946
No. Weddings
are exhausting.

14:00.029 --> 14:02.782
Besides, we need to conserve
our energy for our male lovers.

14:02.865 --> 14:04.784
At least yours isn't younger
than the groom.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.578
Yeah, I think the, uh,
stepfather of the bride

14:06.661 --> 14:07.620
should have at least

14:07.704 --> 14:09.247
an age-appropriate boyfriend.

14:09.330 --> 14:11.082
Call me old fashioned, but I just do.

14:11.165 --> 14:14.127
Oh, Karl.
What's that on your face?

14:14.210 --> 14:15.420
What?

14:15.503 --> 14:17.463
Oh, my God, are you
wearing makeup?

14:17.547 --> 14:18.840
Less than you.

14:18.923 --> 14:20.758
You really are
spreading your wings.

14:20.842 --> 14:22.802
I think I'm leaving
the country in the nick of time.

14:22.885 --> 14:26.639
- I'm off to the ladies' room
- I'll order you a gimlet.

14:37.984 --> 14:39.819
Simone?

14:39.902 --> 14:40.987
Hi.

14:43.906 --> 14:46.284
Uh, you are Dr. Bennett's
wife, right?

14:46.367 --> 14:49.495
Maureen. I also work
in his practice as a nurse.

14:49.579 --> 14:51.331
Well, isn't that nice?

14:51.414 --> 14:54.167
I don't know
quite how to say this.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.629
But... do you know
your husband's a homosexual?

14:59.631 --> 15:02.634
Yes, I know.

15:02.717 --> 15:04.719
And you said it just fine.

15:04.802 --> 15:06.804
I realize it's none
of my business.

15:06.888 --> 15:08.473
I'm just trying to
be a good person.

15:08.556 --> 15:12.352
And like all good people, you
just couldn't wait to tell me.

15:12.435 --> 15:16.230
I'm going now.
Feel free to adjust your halo.

15:16.314 --> 15:18.483
Has Karl told you
he's sick?

15:18.566 --> 15:21.027
What?

15:21.110 --> 15:22.612
I can see he hasn't.

15:25.573 --> 15:27.075
Karl isn't sick.

15:27.158 --> 15:29.702
He saw my husband
three days ago.

15:29.786 --> 15:30.828
He has that new disease

15:30.912 --> 15:32.205
that all the gay men
are spreading.

15:32.288 --> 15:34.040
That's a lie.

15:34.123 --> 15:36.042
He's the third man
my husband's seen who's had it.

15:36.125 --> 15:39.045
The first two
are dead.

15:39.128 --> 15:41.839
I'm so sorry.
I just thought you should know.

15:50.973 --> 15:52.225
I know, I know, I know,

15:52.308 --> 15:54.060
I know, I know
it sounds unbelievable

15:54.143 --> 15:56.896
and faintly ridiculous,
but bear with me on this...

15:56.979 --> 16:00.483
Oh, hello, darling.
It's perfect timing.

16:00.566 --> 16:02.735
I was just telling everyone
the story of our trip to Venice,

16:02.819 --> 16:05.905
when you accidentally knocked
that gondolier into the water.

16:05.988 --> 16:08.241
Now,
did that really happen?

16:08.324 --> 16:10.326
Or is Karl just
embellishing?

16:11.994 --> 16:16.040
No, that-that's not the kind
of thing Karl would lie about.

16:16.124 --> 16:18.751
So, there he was,
dripping wet,

16:18.835 --> 16:21.963
hacking up great lungfuls
of the Grand Canal,

16:22.046 --> 16:23.131
and I realized
it's very difficult

16:23.214 --> 16:24.549
to maintain
one's dignity...

16:35.086 --> 16:36.880
Hey.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.883
- Hey. Where have you been all morning?
- Ah... out.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.009
Doing stuff.
Doing great stuff, in fact.

16:41.092 --> 16:42.677
Come with me outside.
I've got something to show you.

16:42.761 --> 16:45.055
- Come on.
- You never came to bed last night.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.598
Did you get
any sleep at all?

16:46.681 --> 16:48.225
No. No, it turns out
one of the side effects

16:48.308 --> 16:51.353
of near-constant cocaine use
is a wee bit of insomnia.

16:51.436 --> 16:52.646
Come on.

16:55.565 --> 16:57.359
- Oh! Wow!
- Right?

16:57.442 --> 16:58.527
You like it?

16:58.610 --> 17:01.780
- It... uh... you bought this?
- I did.

17:01.863 --> 17:04.741
Well, uh, technically
American Express bought it.

17:04.824 --> 17:05.825
But that bill's gonna get paid

17:05.909 --> 17:07.744
the second my first script
payment comes through.

17:07.828 --> 17:08.703
You like it?

17:08.787 --> 17:11.456
Look, I know you've been
working really hard,

17:11.540 --> 17:13.542
and I get that you'd want
to treat yourself...

17:13.625 --> 17:14.834
Me? No. Whoa.

17:14.918 --> 17:16.920
No, I didn't...
This isn't for me.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.423
Y-You bought me a car?

17:20.507 --> 17:22.217
I did.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.136
- Shut. Up.
- I won't.

17:25.220 --> 17:27.264
This is me saying thank you.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.266
- For what?
- My God, for everything.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.102
For all the help
you gave me with the script.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.104
For standing by me when Taylor
lost her mind...

17:34.187 --> 17:37.941
Oh, God... Taylor's
not gonna like this.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.235
Well, you know what?
Taylor doesn't get a vote, okay?

17:42.237 --> 17:44.614
It looks expensive.
Are you sure?

17:44.698 --> 17:46.575
Well, I made you
a promise, right?

17:46.658 --> 17:48.785
I said when this money
came through,

17:48.868 --> 17:51.997
I would take care of you.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.500
People have made me
a lot of promises in my life.

17:57.711 --> 18:00.755
Nobody's ever kept one before.

18:00.839 --> 18:03.008
Well, this is me keeping mine.

18:03.091 --> 18:05.635
And this is
just the beginning.

18:05.719 --> 18:09.806
So... do you like it?

18:13.393 --> 18:14.477
It's perfect.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.328
Just keep
going straight.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.330
So I've been doing
some research,

18:33.413 --> 18:34.956
finding jobs a
pregnant woman can do.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.207
I already have a job.

18:36.291 --> 18:38.918
You shouldn't be on your feet
all day when you're expecting,

18:39.002 --> 18:41.212
but don't worry.
There are plenty of ways

18:41.296 --> 18:43.298
a girl in your condition
can make a living.

18:43.381 --> 18:44.674
Are there?

18:44.758 --> 18:46.676
Sure. You could be

18:46.760 --> 18:48.303
a pin setter in
a bowling alley.

18:48.386 --> 18:50.347
All you'd have to do
is punch buttons.

18:50.430 --> 18:54.351
- I found an opening at an alley in Anaheim.
- Now take a left.

18:55.935 --> 18:59.356
Or... there's a place
hiring switchboard operators.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.066
For that, you'd have
to move to Barstow.

19:01.149 --> 19:02.692
It sounds like you're
trying to get rid of me.

19:02.776 --> 19:04.861
Don't be silly.

19:06.571 --> 19:08.907
I just thought it might
be easier for you

19:08.990 --> 19:11.242
to make a fresh start
in a new city.

19:11.326 --> 19:13.870
- Well, I'm not moving.
- Okay.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.955
Just know I'm here for you.

19:16.039 --> 19:18.041
For anything you need.

19:20.085 --> 19:21.169
Thank you.

19:21.252 --> 19:24.673
Oh... uh, pull over,
this is it.

19:37.435 --> 19:38.812
This must be
a mistake.

19:38.895 --> 19:40.689
A doctor wouldn't have
his office in here.

19:40.772 --> 19:42.607
No, this is it.

19:42.691 --> 19:45.360
Are you sure you have
the address right?

19:45.443 --> 19:47.946
Sheila, I lied. I'm not
here to see a doctor.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.706
I don't understand.

19:57.789 --> 20:00.250
I'm sorry. I just
can't have this baby.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.419
What are you
talking about?

20:02.502 --> 20:05.380
Please do not make me
say this out loud.

20:06.548 --> 20:08.758
What you're going
to do, it's illegal.

20:08.842 --> 20:10.969
I know.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.238
God, how did you even
hear about this place?

20:30.321 --> 20:32.073
A girl at the
diner referred me.

20:32.907 --> 20:33.950
You...

20:34.033 --> 20:35.118
Excuse me.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.911
You can't do this,
it's not right.

20:36.995 --> 20:40.040
Sheila, please do not make this
harder than it already is.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.676
I'm Sally Jones.
We spoke on the phone.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.429
Who's she?

20:54.512 --> 20:55.472
My friend.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.183
She'll drive me home afterwards.

20:58.266 --> 21:00.477
- You got the money?
- I do.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.228
Come on in.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.566
Sheila. Please.

21:08.109 --> 21:11.070
I really need a friend
right now, more than ever.

21:18.369 --> 21:20.455
- Here you go, son.
- Thank you, sir.

21:20.538 --> 21:21.831
I'll have your car here
in just a second.

21:21.915 --> 21:25.168
- Terrific night.
- Lovely seeing you all.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.128
Let's do it again
very soon.

21:27.212 --> 21:29.297
Good night, Simone.
See you at the wedding.

21:33.218 --> 21:36.304
All right, we're alone.
You can tell me now.

21:36.387 --> 21:37.847
Tell you what?

21:37.931 --> 21:40.183
How I've upset you.
And don't say you're fine.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.852
You've barely said two words
to me the entire evening.

21:42.936 --> 21:44.854
Wait till
we're in the car.

21:44.938 --> 21:48.191
Can I at least have
a headline?

21:48.274 --> 21:51.236
I ran into your doctor's wife
in the ladies' room.

21:51.319 --> 21:53.238
Don't think I've ever met her.

21:53.321 --> 21:56.241
She also works as a nurse.

21:56.324 --> 21:57.700
In his office.

22:03.456 --> 22:04.624
What did she say?

22:05.625 --> 22:07.502
You're sick.

22:09.462 --> 22:13.466
Well, two things:
first of all...

22:13.550 --> 22:14.968
I'm not sick.

22:15.969 --> 22:18.054
Secondly, what a gossipy bitch.

22:18.137 --> 22:21.057
- Are you saying she lied?
- I'm not... symptomatic.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.518
- I feel fine.
- So what's the makeup hiding?

22:23.601 --> 22:24.686
A spot.

22:24.769 --> 22:26.563
- Don't you mean a lesion?
- Oh, come on,

22:26.646 --> 22:27.897
it's miniscule.

22:27.981 --> 22:30.733
Do you have any idea
how scared I am?

22:30.817 --> 22:32.861
- You don't have it.
- What?

22:32.944 --> 22:35.363
Look, the fact is, it can only
be transmitted through blood

22:35.446 --> 22:37.240
or bodily fluids,
and we rarely had sex,

22:37.323 --> 22:38.783
and never without a condom.

22:38.867 --> 22:40.577
Is that what you think?

22:42.328 --> 22:44.372
- That I'm scared for myself?
- Darling, darling, darling,

22:44.455 --> 22:47.959
I, I, I...
I should have told you,

22:48.042 --> 22:50.712
my love, I just...

22:50.795 --> 22:53.256
I did... I just didn't want
to spoil your trip.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.425
Oh, God, the trip.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.343
Look, I'm so sorry.
I-I-I-I promise

22:57.427 --> 23:00.930
I... I-I will call once
a week while you're away,

23:01.014 --> 23:03.266
with, with full
medical updates.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.268
You think I'm still going?

23:05.351 --> 23:07.562
That I'd leave you
at a time like this?

23:07.645 --> 23:09.939
And what would staying achieve?

23:10.023 --> 23:11.774
Other than letting me know

23:11.858 --> 23:13.776
that you think I won't make it
past Labor Day?

23:18.364 --> 23:20.074
You need care, Karl.

23:20.158 --> 23:24.913
Specialists. And at least
one doctor whose wife

23:24.996 --> 23:28.082
is not the goddamn town crier!

23:28.166 --> 23:30.460
I know how much
Tommy means to you.

23:30.543 --> 23:33.129
I'm staying with you,
and that is the end

23:33.213 --> 23:35.715
of this discussion.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.554
Thank you.

23:52.065 --> 23:54.609
- Do you want some whiskey?
- Whiskey?

23:54.692 --> 23:57.487
It's good to get a little
drunk before you start.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.947
Helps with the pain.

23:59.030 --> 24:01.824
- No, thank you.
- Suit yourself.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.451
Just give me a couple
of minutes.

24:03.534 --> 24:07.038
I got to get some plastic
over the table.

24:07.121 --> 24:09.332
She's doing this
in the kitchen?

24:09.415 --> 24:12.460
Apparently.

24:12.543 --> 24:14.504
But it's an
invasive procedure.

24:14.587 --> 24:18.383
It requires a clean environment.
Sterilized instruments.

24:18.466 --> 24:20.134
Well, this is all
I can afford.

24:20.218 --> 24:23.680
I'm out of options, Sheila.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.723
Please understand.

24:33.606 --> 24:34.691
There's something
you don't know.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.275
There's something
I need to tell you.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.404
What's that?

24:41.447 --> 24:44.701
I had a child once,

24:44.784 --> 24:46.828
but she died.

24:48.621 --> 24:52.291
I left the gate
to the backyard open.

24:52.375 --> 24:54.252
She wandered out
into the street

24:54.335 --> 24:57.797
and she was hit
by a car.

24:59.966 --> 25:03.678
It's been years, but I think
about her every day.

25:03.761 --> 25:07.724
Sometimes,
late at night,

25:07.807 --> 25:11.185
I wonder what kind
of young woman

25:11.269 --> 25:13.730
she'd have
turned into.

25:13.813 --> 25:18.568
How could you tell me
something like that right now?

25:18.651 --> 25:21.362
Are you... are you trying
to make me feel guilty?

25:21.446 --> 25:23.448
- No, you don't understand.
- No, I think you don't understand, Sheila.

25:23.531 --> 25:26.576
- I have to do this.
- Honey, I'm trying to say...

25:26.659 --> 25:31.581
I think my daughter would have
grown up to be a lot like you.

25:31.664 --> 25:34.584
That is one of the reasons
I love you.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.754
But right now
I'm afraid for you

25:37.837 --> 25:40.131
because women die
in places like this.

25:40.214 --> 25:41.424
I can't
let that happen.

25:41.507 --> 25:43.760
Sheila, I'm single
and I'm broke.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.803
I can't raise a baby.

25:45.887 --> 25:49.265
We'll figure it out.
We just need time to think.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.476
- Let me help you.
- How?

25:51.559 --> 25:54.896
Well, I'll...

25:54.979 --> 25:58.441
I'll get some... I'll get
my hands on some money.

25:58.524 --> 26:01.444
We can go somewhere else,
somewhere safe, but please,

26:01.527 --> 26:03.571
let's get out of here.

26:06.199 --> 26:08.367
Okay. Okay.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.630
Hello?

26:20.713 --> 26:23.508
Yeah, this is she.

26:23.591 --> 26:26.761
No, I haven't lost my Amex. Why?

26:26.844 --> 26:28.638
Suspicious activity?

26:28.721 --> 26:31.599
Um, how much was spent?

26:41.067 --> 26:42.985
Nice car.

26:43.069 --> 26:43.986
Taylor.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.489
- Were you in the house?
- I came to talk to Eli

26:46.572 --> 26:49.158
so he could explain to me
why my credit card is maxed out,

26:49.242 --> 26:52.328
and then I saw you pull up
in this brand-new car.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.996
Well, I-I don't know
when he'll be home.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.498
He has a meeting
at Paramount and...

26:55.581 --> 26:58.334
He bought it for you, didn't he?

26:58.417 --> 27:01.212
I told him
it was too much.

27:01.295 --> 27:02.880
- When?
- The moment he gave it to me.

27:02.964 --> 27:06.217
No. I'm asking
when did he give it to you?

27:06.300 --> 27:10.346
Before I saw you in the park
this morning or after?

27:11.597 --> 27:13.516
After.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.685
So why didn't you insist
he take it back?

27:15.768 --> 27:18.646
I was so surprised,
I didn't know what to say.

27:18.729 --> 27:21.524
Surprised? Jade, I had just
told you that when Eli is high,

27:21.607 --> 27:24.569
- he's stupid with money.
- Well, I don't think it's stupid.

27:24.652 --> 27:27.864
I spend every day
cooking and cleaning,

27:27.947 --> 27:32.076
running errands
and looking after you both.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.703
I think it's nice
that someone actually

27:33.786 --> 27:35.329
wanted to say
thank you.

27:35.413 --> 27:38.541
You want a thank you?
Okay, fine, Jade.

27:38.624 --> 27:39.917
Thank you.

27:40.001 --> 27:41.502
Now give me
the keys.

27:41.586 --> 27:44.380
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm gonna return the car, obviously.

27:44.463 --> 27:45.756
No.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.884
- What do you mean no?
- You can't return the car.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.261
It's not yours.
Eli bought it for me.

27:50.344 --> 27:51.679
Yeah, but he's coked
out of his mind.

27:51.762 --> 27:53.389
To accept a gift from a man
in that condition

27:53.472 --> 27:54.557
is not a good look.

27:54.640 --> 27:58.144
My God. Why are you
acting like this?

27:58.227 --> 28:00.062
I haven't done
anything wrong.

28:00.146 --> 28:02.607
You are taking advantage
of this situation.

28:02.690 --> 28:04.442
You're using Eli.
Just give me the keys.

28:04.525 --> 28:06.611
Stop it.
If anyone is a user,

28:06.694 --> 28:09.864
Taylor, it's you. You have been
using me for months.

28:09.947 --> 28:13.034
I saved you.
I brought you into my home.

28:13.117 --> 28:15.036
You did that for yourself,
not for me.

28:15.119 --> 28:18.080
Your marriage was falling apart
and you needed a distraction.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.374
Eli wasn't writing
or making money,

28:20.458 --> 28:21.584
and you were
so angry

28:21.667 --> 28:23.169
you could barely
even look at him.

28:23.252 --> 28:25.588
By the way, I'm the one
who got him writing again.

28:25.671 --> 28:28.007
I did that for you.

28:28.090 --> 28:29.759
You're welcome.

28:31.802 --> 28:35.014
I keep wondering why
Eli started using again.

28:38.434 --> 28:40.603
Are you the reason?

28:43.231 --> 28:46.943
Oh, my God.
We shouldn't be doing this.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.946
Fighting and throwing blame
at each other.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.614
We're supposed
to be a family.

28:51.697 --> 28:53.616
Stop it. Stop it, Jade!

28:53.699 --> 28:55.284
Eli and I
are a family.

28:55.368 --> 28:58.913
You are a houseguest.

28:58.996 --> 29:02.166
That's all.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.089
You know what, Jade?
Go upstairs,

29:08.172 --> 29:12.677
get your stuff.
I want you out of my house now!

29:15.721 --> 29:17.890
That's not gonna happen.

29:17.974 --> 29:20.434
You can leave again
if you want,

29:20.518 --> 29:23.646
but I'm not going anywhere,

29:23.729 --> 29:26.107
and I'm keeping the car.

29:26.190 --> 29:29.443
I'm not gonna let you
take it away from me.

30:01.116 --> 30:02.409
Tommy, come in.

30:02.492 --> 30:05.078
Hi. I have great news.

30:05.162 --> 30:07.914
I returned your brooch
and I got your replacement gift.

30:07.998 --> 30:09.749
Well, it's not
a traditional gift

30:09.833 --> 30:12.544
so much as a tribute to you.

30:12.627 --> 30:15.005
I sure hope you like it
because, uh,

30:15.088 --> 30:16.923
I can't really return it.

30:18.466 --> 30:21.011
Hey. You look sad. What's wrong?

30:21.094 --> 30:23.388
We need to talk.

30:27.142 --> 30:28.685
Hey. Hey, great news.

30:28.768 --> 30:30.896
Paramount wants to talk to me
about adapting a novel.

30:30.979 --> 30:32.772
I got a meeting on Friday.
I'm telling you,

30:32.856 --> 30:34.900
this comeback shit
is really starting to get real.

30:34.983 --> 30:38.153
I'm really,
really happy for you.

30:38.236 --> 30:40.071
What's wrong?

30:40.155 --> 30:42.157
Taylor stopped by.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.368
I'm guessing that
didn't go so well, huh?

30:45.452 --> 30:46.953
Oh, Eli.

30:47.037 --> 30:48.705
I hate this.

30:48.788 --> 30:52.083
I hate that she's putting me
in this position.

30:52.167 --> 30:54.377
What position?
What are you talking about?

30:54.461 --> 30:56.796
She wants me to get
the passwords to your accounts,

30:56.880 --> 30:58.840
so she can take away
all your money.

31:06.514 --> 31:08.767
Cancel the trip?

31:08.850 --> 31:10.393
I can't leave
when Karl is sick.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.062
Yeah, but-but he's not
even in the hospital.

31:12.145 --> 31:14.022
Not yet, but this disease
is unpredictable.

31:14.105 --> 31:14.981
I need to be here.

31:15.065 --> 31:17.234
No, that's not fair.
This was supposed to be

31:17.317 --> 31:18.777
the best summer of my life.

31:18.860 --> 31:21.029
And this could be
the last summer of Karl's life,

31:21.112 --> 31:23.031
so please stop sulking.

31:25.742 --> 31:27.827
- What are you doing?
- I need a drink.

31:27.911 --> 31:29.079
You're barely 18.

31:29.162 --> 31:31.248
Yeah, well, dating
you has aged me.

31:31.331 --> 31:33.250
Give me that.

31:38.004 --> 31:40.799
One week, that's all I ask.

31:40.882 --> 31:43.510
Nothing can happen
in-in a-a week.

31:43.593 --> 31:47.973
What would be the point?
I wouldn't enjoy myself.

31:48.056 --> 31:49.808
In Paris? With me?

31:49.891 --> 31:53.645
My husband is dying.

31:53.728 --> 31:55.855
Can you not understand
what that means?

31:55.939 --> 31:59.776
So what's gonna happen to us?

32:01.236 --> 32:04.030
I don't think
there can be an "us."

32:06.950 --> 32:09.494
Look...

32:09.577 --> 32:12.831
I know that I can act
like a kid sometimes,

32:12.914 --> 32:15.667
but if you give me another
chance, I can be more mature.

32:15.750 --> 32:17.460
No.

32:17.544 --> 32:21.047
You stay young.

32:21.131 --> 32:24.342
I'm the one
who needs to grow up.

32:26.261 --> 32:27.387
That might be
Karl's doctor.

32:27.470 --> 32:28.847
I, I'm gonna take it
in the other room.

32:28.930 --> 32:31.141
- Simone...
- No.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.544
Tommy.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.233
All right, great,

33:22.317 --> 33:24.903
and you can transfer
those funds today, right?

33:24.986 --> 33:27.739
All right, thank you.
Yeah, I'll talk to you.

33:27.822 --> 33:29.741
Bye.

33:29.824 --> 33:32.369
All right. All right,
so my business manager's on it.

33:32.452 --> 33:35.288
He's gonna reset the passwords
to all my accounts.

33:35.372 --> 33:38.291
And I spoke to Lamar. I forbid
him to speak to Taylor,

33:38.375 --> 33:40.960
so she can't use him to try
to get to my script payments.

33:41.044 --> 33:43.088
That's a relief.

33:43.171 --> 33:45.090
Do you think
it'll be enough?

33:45.173 --> 33:47.258
What do you mean?

33:47.342 --> 33:49.761
Taylor was here, in the house,
while we were out.

33:49.844 --> 33:51.596
Maybe we should think
about changing the locks.

33:51.679 --> 33:55.475
Whoa. Uh, I mean,
she's my wife and she loves me.

33:55.558 --> 33:57.477
In her way she's just
trying to protect me.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.354
She's trying
to control you.

33:59.437 --> 34:03.274
There's a difference.

34:03.358 --> 34:05.068
I don't know.

34:05.151 --> 34:07.987
I mean, maybe I should
just call her.

34:08.071 --> 34:09.155
No!

34:09.239 --> 34:10.865
I mean,
I know you want

34:10.949 --> 34:12.784
to believe that
she's gonna come around,

34:12.867 --> 34:15.995
but you have to know, deep down,
there's no way she's ever

34:16.079 --> 34:18.581
gonna get on board
with the idea of you using.

34:20.417 --> 34:21.960
And she's threatening
to call your dad.

34:22.043 --> 34:23.837
My dad?
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:23.920 --> 34:26.089
Why?

34:26.172 --> 34:28.758
She knows that I don't speak
to him. Goddamn it.

34:28.842 --> 34:30.135
She can't just fucking do that.

34:30.218 --> 34:33.721
She's trying to make
you feel small.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.765
I hate that she's
treating you this way.

34:35.849 --> 34:38.017
The last thing I want is
to see you lose everything

34:38.101 --> 34:40.979
you've been working
so hard to get.

34:41.062 --> 34:43.148
Who are you calling?

34:43.231 --> 34:44.774
Our handyman. You're right.

34:44.858 --> 34:46.901
We're gonna change
those fucking locks.

34:49.737 --> 34:52.907
Rob's got an awful lot
of old sports equipment.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.826
And he never uses any of it.

34:54.909 --> 34:58.163
So I'm taking it
to the pawnshop

34:58.246 --> 35:00.331
and giving the cash to April.

35:00.415 --> 35:03.042
Well, that'll be
a nice chunk of change.

35:03.126 --> 35:05.336
It will be easier for her
to make a rational decision

35:05.420 --> 35:08.590
about the baby if she's
not so worried about money.

35:08.673 --> 35:11.718
I still can't believe
you talked her out of it.

35:11.801 --> 35:14.637
That horrible place?
I couldn't let her stay.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.306
Here, put this
in the big pile, please.

35:16.389 --> 35:20.768
I got to admit
I'm a bit surprised.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.353
Surprised?

35:22.437 --> 35:24.230
She's pregnant
with your husband's kid.

35:24.314 --> 35:25.690
Most wives in that situation

35:25.773 --> 35:27.942
wouldn't care how rusty
the knives were.

35:28.026 --> 35:30.195
Couldn't let anything happen
to April or her baby.

35:30.278 --> 35:33.198
Honey, y-you know that she could
still decide to get rid of it.

35:33.281 --> 35:35.200
I know. That's why
I have to work hard

35:35.283 --> 35:37.076
over the next few days
to change her mind.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.038
Well, talk to her
about adoption.

35:40.121 --> 35:42.081
You know, there's-there's plenty
of nice people out there

35:42.165 --> 35:43.458
who can't have kids.

35:44.459 --> 35:47.045
I'll mention that.

35:47.128 --> 35:49.047
There's also
another possibility.

35:49.130 --> 35:50.548
What's that?

35:50.632 --> 35:52.842
Rob and I could raise the baby.

35:54.844 --> 35:56.387
What?

35:56.471 --> 35:58.223
I've got it all figured out.

35:58.306 --> 36:00.558
I'll support April
until the baby arrives,

36:00.642 --> 36:02.185
then I'll offer to raise it.

36:02.268 --> 36:05.188
As far as Rob's concerned,
I could arrange some scenario,

36:05.271 --> 36:08.107
finding it in a bassinet
in a park, abandoned.

36:08.191 --> 36:10.109
No one would ever have
to know the truth.

36:10.193 --> 36:12.779
Rob would have his child,
April could have her career,

36:12.862 --> 36:14.906
everyone would be happy.

36:17.951 --> 36:19.410
What's wrong?

36:20.828 --> 36:22.914
At first I thought it was funny,

36:22.997 --> 36:25.750
you becoming friends
with your husband's slut.

36:25.833 --> 36:27.460
- Sheila, that word.
- And then, when you kept getting

36:27.544 --> 36:30.838
closer to her, I thought
you were a little nutty.

36:30.922 --> 36:34.634
But no. You're sick.

36:34.717 --> 36:36.094
I'm not sick.

36:36.177 --> 36:38.930
Your kid is dead.

36:39.013 --> 36:42.225
And you're trying to replace her
with April's baby.

36:42.308 --> 36:43.268
That is not what I'm doing.

36:43.351 --> 36:45.144
That is what you're doing
from where I'm standing.

36:45.228 --> 36:46.938
You're not allowed to judge me.

36:47.021 --> 36:48.940
Not until
you pick out

36:49.023 --> 36:52.777
Benny's casket
and dress him in his Sunday best

36:52.860 --> 36:54.779
and put him in the ground.

36:54.862 --> 36:57.949
Until you do that, I don't
want to hear another word

36:58.032 --> 37:00.910
from you.

37:16.718 --> 37:18.428
Hello?

37:18.511 --> 37:20.763
Simone, thank God you answered.

37:20.847 --> 37:22.974
Naomi. What's going on?

37:23.057 --> 37:24.434
I ran out without my purse,

37:24.517 --> 37:26.477
and I don't have
my insurance card or my ID,

37:26.561 --> 37:27.645
and the housekeeper
isn't answering,

37:27.729 --> 37:29.105
and I don't have
anyone else to call.

37:29.188 --> 37:30.982
Slow down. What's going on?
Where are you?

37:31.065 --> 37:32.442
I'm at the hospital.

37:32.525 --> 37:34.777
I need my purse.
Can you please bring it?

37:34.861 --> 37:36.654
Well, of course.
What's happened?

37:36.738 --> 37:38.573
Tommy's been in a car accident.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.659
I-I'll be right there.

37:52.695 --> 37:53.988
Yes. Can I help you?

37:54.072 --> 37:55.907
I'm here to speak
to Rob Stanton.

37:55.990 --> 37:57.867
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

37:57.951 --> 37:59.953
But I'm not leaving
until I speak to him.

38:00.036 --> 38:01.496
I beg your pardon?

38:01.579 --> 38:03.998
Tell him it's April.

38:05.041 --> 38:06.292
Oh.

38:06.376 --> 38:07.836
So you know who I am.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.879
I do.

38:09.963 --> 38:12.799
I'm sorry, but he won't see you.

38:12.882 --> 38:14.717
I really think
that you should go.

38:22.350 --> 38:23.643
Miss!

38:23.726 --> 38:25.311
Please stop.

38:26.563 --> 38:27.981
I'm sorry, Mr. Stanton.

38:28.064 --> 38:29.482
I told her you were busy.

38:29.566 --> 38:32.694
It's all right.
What do you want?

38:32.777 --> 38:34.821
One lousy minute
of your time.

38:34.904 --> 38:36.865
You owe me that,
don't you think?

38:38.700 --> 38:40.910
Claire, go ahead
and shut the door.

38:49.252 --> 38:51.921
I'm sorry I didn't return
your phone calls.

38:53.423 --> 38:55.133
I thought a clean break
was just better for...

38:55.216 --> 38:56.092
I'm pregnant.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.013
Don't worry.
I don't need anything from you.

39:00.096 --> 39:01.681
I'm not keeping it.

39:01.764 --> 39:03.725
The way you
treated me,

39:03.808 --> 39:05.727
I wasn't even
going to tell you.

39:05.810 --> 39:08.021
But I'm not a bad person.

39:08.104 --> 39:10.356
You have a right to know.

39:12.609 --> 39:15.236
Anyway, that's all
I came here to say, so...

39:15.320 --> 39:17.405
goodbye.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.365
Have a nice life.

39:19.449 --> 39:21.367
Wait.

39:29.459 --> 39:31.878
Simone, thank you so much.

39:31.961 --> 39:34.047
- Where's Tommy?
- They're doing some scans of his head.

39:34.130 --> 39:35.882
He has a possible concussion.

39:35.965 --> 39:37.717
They need to be sure
there's no swelling.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.177
But he'll be all right?

39:39.260 --> 39:40.762
He's pretty banged up.

39:40.845 --> 39:43.389
He has a bad cut on his leg,
but he'll recover.

39:43.473 --> 39:45.767
- Oh, thank God.
- He was driving while drunk.

39:45.850 --> 39:47.894
I couldn't believe it
when the nurse told me.

39:47.977 --> 39:50.271
Tommy would never...

39:50.355 --> 39:53.775
God. What's happened to my boy?

39:53.858 --> 39:56.402
I feel so awful.

39:56.486 --> 39:58.071
You're so sweet to be here.

39:58.154 --> 40:01.115
Even now, when you're going
through your own hell.

40:01.199 --> 40:02.200
What do you mean?

40:02.283 --> 40:04.786
I know about Karl,

40:04.869 --> 40:06.621
how he's sick
with that gay disease.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.748
I don't know
what you've heard, but...

40:08.831 --> 40:10.959
Ida Coy told me.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.961
She was in one of the stalls

40:13.044 --> 40:15.129
when you were talking
to Dr. Bennett's wife.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.882
Oh, God. Well, please
don't tell anyone else.

40:17.966 --> 40:19.467
Karl would be so upset.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.094
I don't care about Karl.

40:21.177 --> 40:23.805
You're the one
I'm concerned for.

40:23.888 --> 40:25.640
Are you okay?

40:25.723 --> 40:28.142
Well, I don't have it,
if that's what you're asking.

40:28.226 --> 40:29.978
Well, I hope not.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.856
No one seems to know how
those people are spreading it.

40:34.190 --> 40:35.775
We brought
your son to a room

40:35.858 --> 40:37.735
- if you want to see him.
- Yes, please, let's go.

40:37.819 --> 40:39.487
Oh, but we can only allow
family back there.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.447
Oh, Simone is
practically family.

40:41.531 --> 40:43.116
Sorry, it's policy.

40:43.199 --> 40:44.117
It's fine.
Just-just

40:44.200 --> 40:45.618
- call me later.
- I will.

40:45.702 --> 40:47.996
And I will be there for you
when you need me.

41:00.967 --> 41:02.510
<i>Truth is,
I fell in love with Jade</i>

41:02.594 --> 41:05.722
<i>without really knowing
who she was.</i>

41:07.849 --> 41:11.686
<i>And what's worse is
I brought her into my home.</i>

41:14.939 --> 41:18.568
<i>Now she's sleeping in my bed
and I'm living in a hotel.</i>

41:18.651 --> 41:20.653
<i>I need her out of my house.</i>

41:22.030 --> 41:23.948
<i>But she's enabling
my drug addict husband</i>

41:24.032 --> 41:26.659
<i>and I don't think
he'll just let her go.</i>

41:26.743 --> 41:29.871
Not to mention the fact that you
and I both know how intensely

41:29.954 --> 41:32.206
she can react
when she feels threatened.

41:32.290 --> 41:36.836
If I'm gonna get her out of
the house, I need to be smart.

41:36.919 --> 41:38.671
I need leverage.

41:38.755 --> 41:41.841
And I thought you might be just
the person to help me with that.

41:41.925 --> 41:43.676
Why would I help you?

41:43.760 --> 41:47.347
I'm thinking, you scratch
my back, I scratch yours.

41:47.430 --> 41:49.724
All you got to do is
tell me where it itches.

41:49.807 --> 41:52.352
They set my bail at $10,000.

41:52.435 --> 41:55.521
They seem to think
I'm dangerous.

41:55.605 --> 42:00.318
Well, as luck would have it,
I brought my checkbook.

42:03.112 --> 42:06.866
Well, in that case,
how can I help?

42:06.949 --> 42:09.077
Tell me everything
you know about Jade.

42:09.160 --> 42:12.872
Well, for starters,
that's not her real name.

42:14.123 --> 42:15.917
Oh, shit.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.337
Hold on, darling.
You ain't heard nothing yet.

42:23.174 --> 42:26.094
Oh. Oh, my poor baby.

42:28.137 --> 42:30.014
How is his leg?

42:30.098 --> 42:33.017
Well, he needed
some stitches,

42:33.101 --> 42:36.437
but he will be good
as new in no time.

42:41.025 --> 42:43.152
What in the world?

42:45.446 --> 42:47.407
Who's Simone?

42:47.490 --> 42:49.033
That his girlfriend?

42:50.493 --> 42:52.954
Bit young
for a tattoo.

42:55.498 --> 42:57.500
One day he's gonna
regret that.

43:01.003 --> 43:03.047
So will she.

43:08.010 --> 43:09.929
Hey there.

43:10.012 --> 43:11.305
How you feeling?

43:11.389 --> 43:12.932
Better,
now that you're here.

43:13.015 --> 43:15.435
Aw. Need help with anything?

43:15.518 --> 43:18.312
Oh, I'm just peeling potatoes.
I think I can handle it.

43:18.396 --> 43:20.356
I'm gonna change clothes.

43:20.440 --> 43:24.277
When I'm done, I'll come down
and set the table for you.

43:24.360 --> 43:26.446
You're sweet.

43:33.369 --> 43:34.454
Leo.

43:34.537 --> 43:35.747
What are you doing here?

43:35.830 --> 43:37.373
Where's Rob?

43:37.457 --> 43:39.500
He just went upstairs.
Is something wrong?

43:39.584 --> 43:40.960
Yeah, you need
to come to our house.

43:41.043 --> 43:43.129
You got a phone call
from you-know-who.

43:43.212 --> 43:45.256
She said
it's important.

43:45.339 --> 43:47.175
Oh.

43:47.258 --> 43:49.844
And Sheila wanted me to tell you

43:49.927 --> 43:52.096
this is the last time
she's doing this for you.

43:52.180 --> 43:53.931
She's still angry with me?

43:54.015 --> 43:56.350
Yeah, something like that.

44:01.939 --> 44:04.484
Do you think I'm
a horrible person?

44:04.567 --> 44:07.695
Nah, I think
you're a nice lady

44:07.779 --> 44:11.240
who's gotten herself
in a real fucking mess.

44:21.083 --> 44:23.085
We're here.

44:27.548 --> 44:29.133
Is she serious?

44:29.217 --> 44:31.219
Oh, yeah.

44:34.931 --> 44:36.307
Hello?

44:36.390 --> 44:38.059
Sheila. What took you so long?

44:38.142 --> 44:40.144
Long story.
I-Is everything okay?

44:40.228 --> 44:43.022
Better than okay.
Everything is wonderful.

44:43.105 --> 44:44.565
- Tell me.
- Well,

44:44.649 --> 44:48.069
I went to Rob's office to let
him know that I'm pregnant.

44:48.152 --> 44:49.695
You did what?

44:49.779 --> 44:51.864
I figured the S.O.B.
had a right to know.

44:51.948 --> 44:53.866
Anyway, I stormed into
his office and I blurted it out,

44:53.950 --> 44:56.786
and do you know
what that big galoot did?

44:56.869 --> 44:58.037
No.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.539
He got down on one knee

44:59.622 --> 45:02.041
and asked me
if I would marry him.

45:03.251 --> 45:05.378
But no, but he's still married.

45:05.461 --> 45:07.213
That's what I said.

45:07.296 --> 45:09.006
But he told me
that his marriage is ending.

45:09.090 --> 45:11.050
He said he just needs
six months.

45:12.760 --> 45:14.554
Six months.

45:14.637 --> 45:15.930
And then

45:16.013 --> 45:17.598
he'll be totally free.

45:19.684 --> 45:21.227
Oh.

45:21.310 --> 45:23.354
Anyway, I just wanted
to call to tell you first.

45:23.437 --> 45:25.231
Now I have to call
and tell my mother.

45:25.314 --> 45:26.482
Oh, Sheila.

45:26.566 --> 45:29.235
I am so happy.

45:38.911 --> 45:43.749
Uh, I would ask if
everything's okay, but, uh,

45:43.833 --> 45:46.919
I don't think I'm allowed
to talk to you anymore.

45:47.003 --> 45:49.046
So...

47:40.400 --> 47:45.400
