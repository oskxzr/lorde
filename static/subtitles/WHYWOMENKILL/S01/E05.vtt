<i>Previously on</i> Why Women Kill..

00:10.552 --> 00:11.594
It's waterproof.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.055
So it's safe
from my tears of joy.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.307
What's wrong?
Am... am I embarrassing you?

00:16.391 --> 00:18.059
- At least take the flowers.
- No!

00:18.143 --> 00:19.310
If you won't accept
this simple gift,

00:19.394 --> 00:20.478
then what does that say
about our future?

00:20.562 --> 00:21.730
We have no future.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.773
- Tommy Harte?
- Amy?

00:23.857 --> 00:26.234
I don't know if
you're seeing anyone these days,

00:26.317 --> 00:28.111
but I could really use
some cheering up.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.113
I was... seeing someone.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.949
But, uh, she recently
broke up with me.

00:33.032 --> 00:34.617
Love is always a risk.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.495
The chance for love doesn't
come around every day.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.123
Are you free Friday?

00:40.206 --> 00:41.499
Yes, <i>lover.</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:43.084
"Ma'am" will be fine.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.627
<i>Now that
Jade's gonna live with us,</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:45.628
<i>we gotta have some way
to introduce her.</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:47.630
Well, why don't we just say
she's family?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.299
I love that.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.633
Jade, what's going on?

00:50.717 --> 00:52.802
- Duke is gonna kill Teacup.
- Teacup?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.679
Our dog. He says
if I don't meet with him,

00:54.763 --> 00:56.139
he's gonna put her down.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.307
For the last two years,

00:57.390 --> 01:00.310
I've been pathetic Eli who...
who can't finish a screenplay,

01:00.393 --> 01:01.770
who can't help
pay the bills.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.104
<i>I just need a fucking win.</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:04.439
<i>I just want to feel like a man</i>

01:04.522 --> 01:05.523
<i>and save a dog</i>

01:05.607 --> 01:07.484
<i>and have that be good enough.</i>

01:07.567 --> 01:08.651
Jade!

01:11.696 --> 01:13.490
<i>April is very sweet.</i>

01:13.573 --> 01:14.949
<i>She's so free-spirited.</i>

01:15.033 --> 01:16.785
You wouldn't believe
the fun we have together.

01:16.868 --> 01:17.660
Try one.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.662
You know,
marijuana?

01:19.746 --> 01:20.997
I don't think it's working.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.458
<i>You're acting like</i>

01:23.541 --> 01:24.501
you're drunk.

01:24.584 --> 01:25.960
That might be the pot.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.338
- Pot?
- It's marijuana.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.839
We will talk
about this later.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.341
I want to be a singer.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.009
Really?

01:33.092 --> 01:34.636
I'm gonna be somebody someday.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.750
I want to be a mommy.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.295
I want to be a movie star.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.338
I want to be a superhero.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.384
Saving the world.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.386
Taking care of my baby.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.097
Going to parties in high heels.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.770
Handsome.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.938
Nice.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.523
Democrat.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.946
What?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.698
Is that a joke?

03:18.781 --> 03:20.617

think, Mr. Porter?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.014
Not bad, kid.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.307
Not bad.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.518
Really? So I got the job?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.353
It's just one night, but...

04:30.436 --> 04:33.022
if it goes well, we could talk
about something more permanent.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.691
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.192
I'll see you Tuesday.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.945
Did you hear that?

04:39.028 --> 04:41.364
Oh, April,
your first singing gig.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.532
Promise me you'll come.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.533
- Tuesday night?
- Mm-hmm.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.575
I wouldn't miss it.

04:44.659 --> 04:45.868
Wonderful.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.371
And you'll finally
get to meet Rob.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.373
What?

04:50.456 --> 04:51.874
I told him that
there was a chance

04:51.958 --> 04:53.376
that I could be
booking this gig,

04:53.459 --> 04:55.336
and he already agreed to come.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.047
- Oh.
- I'll put you two at a table together.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.217
That way you can get
to know each other.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.511
Can't wait.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.932
You'll have to help me
find something to wear.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.226
I'm thinking
maybe that blue dress

05:10.310 --> 05:13.062
- with the sequins.
- Oh, yes, that's nice.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.773
Is something wrong?

05:15.857 --> 05:18.026
Actually, I just remembered,

05:18.109 --> 05:21.112
my aunt Lydia is getting
an operation Tuesday.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.740
- An operation?
- Mm, to...

05:23.823 --> 05:25.908
fix her bunion.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.744
I agreed to bring her
home from the hospital

05:27.827 --> 05:29.620
and look after her.
All night.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.247
Well, can you get someone else
to look after her?

05:31.330 --> 05:32.457
You can't miss my show.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.750
I already promised.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.335
And it's... such a big bunion.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.007
This is about Rob, isn't it?

05:41.090 --> 05:42.550
What?

05:42.633 --> 05:44.427
Just admit it.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.095
You don't want to meet him

05:46.179 --> 05:49.098
because you don't approve
of Rob and I's relationship.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.272
Believe me, that
is not the reason.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.288
I'm telling you,
we're lost.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.956
Well, maybe if you'd asked
for directions

06:14.040 --> 06:15.792
when we got off the highway...

06:15.875 --> 06:18.961
Maybe if you'd picked a motel
closer than 30 miles away...

06:19.045 --> 06:20.797
Oh, I think we go left here?

06:26.010 --> 06:27.470
Oh, we're going in circles.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.931
This is the third time
we've passed that wino.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.475
Well, it's too dark
to read the signs.

06:32.558 --> 06:36.395
Oh, stop and I'll ask
at the liquor store.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.328
We're on Pike Street.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.122
Show me the map.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.639
Move along, kid.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.391
Sorry, we were just leaving.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.184
Not you, sweet cheeks.
You're busted.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.520
- Busted? For what?
- Soliciting.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.522
You think I'm a hooker?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.816
For God's sake,
I'm wearing Yves Saint Laurent.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.234
I didn't say
you weren't successful.

07:23.317 --> 07:24.443
Uh,
she's with me, sir.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.862
She was just asking directions

07:25.945 --> 07:26.988
because we got lost.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.030
Relax, kid.
I'm doing you a favor.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.074
You don't want your first time
to be with a pro.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.325
How dare you?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.077
I'm a well-known philanthropist.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.370
I don't need to know
your specialty.

07:34.453 --> 07:35.413
- Let's go.
- What?

07:35.496 --> 07:36.706
- Uh...
- Come on.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.749
Hey! Seriously, sir,
she's my girlfriend.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.042
I find that hard to believe.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.586
Well, show him your license.

07:41.669 --> 07:42.920
My... Oh, uh...

07:43.004 --> 07:44.839
Uh...

07:46.632 --> 07:49.260
If we just met, how do I
know his name is Tommy Harte

07:49.343 --> 07:50.386
and that he lives in Pasadena

07:50.469 --> 07:52.680
at 74 Oakhurst Drive?

07:52.763 --> 07:54.390
His birthday is March 10.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.893
Okay.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.187
So, if you're a couple
from Pasadena,

07:59.270 --> 08:01.230
why are you going
to a motel in Azusa?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.233
We are having an illicit affair.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.068
We've driven 30 miles
to avoid being spotted

08:06.152 --> 08:07.737
by his mother,
who is my best friend,

08:07.820 --> 08:10.323
and my husband, who is gay.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.371
Well, I got to give you points
for creativity.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.791
Have fun, kid.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.094
Eli! Hey, can you
walk Teacup for me?

08:32.178 --> 08:33.888
I'm helping Taylor
pack for her trip.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.223
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.807
Still going to Fresno, huh?

08:36.891 --> 08:39.810
I have to. This conference has
been on the books for months.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.687
Honey, the people at your firm
know that we were attacked.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.106
I mean, they wouldn't blink
if you opted out.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.651
I know, but I told my sisters
I'm coming to town,

08:46.734 --> 08:48.736
and they're still threatening
to visit this summer,

08:48.819 --> 08:50.780
so we kind of want
to break the news

08:50.863 --> 08:52.990
about our living situation
before that happens.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.117
Why don't you
just shoot them a text?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.745
- I'm not gonna tell my sisters I'm in a throuple via text.
- Yeah.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.497
Just make sure you tell them
it was your idea, not mine.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.249
- But it <i>was</i> your idea.
- Yeah,

09:01.332 --> 09:02.833
but your sisters
hate me enough as it is.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.794
We don't need to throw
any more gas on that fire.

09:06.671 --> 09:10.132
You haven't met them yet,
but they're awful.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.635
All right, Teacup.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.136
Whoa, here we go.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.764
Yeah.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.851
- Lamar.
- Oh!

09:20.935 --> 09:22.603
You <i>do</i> know who I am.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.146
I was curious

09:24.230 --> 09:25.648
'cause you've been avoiding me
for weeks.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.316
No, no, no. No, I...

09:27.400 --> 09:29.527
I-I was absolutely
gonna call you back, man.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.570
I just...
I've been incredibly busy.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.614
I see you had time to get a dog.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.824
Oh, forgot to tell you.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.158
You'll like this.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.119
Finally had that threesome.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.663
I would ask what one has to do
with the other,

09:40.746 --> 09:41.998
but never the fuck mind.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.333
- Where is my script?
- Script?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.627
The one you promised
would be done a month ago?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.296
The one I talked up
to Paramount.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.131
Got 'em all excited,
and now they're pissed off

09:50.214 --> 09:51.632
wondering what happened to it.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.009
Well, it-it's almost done.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.344
I'm just... making
a few final tweaks.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.971
Oh, please.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.473
The only line older than that
is "let there be light."

09:59.557 --> 10:01.559
No, I'm not lying.
Look, I-I swear to you...

10:01.642 --> 10:03.519
I swear to you, I will have it
to you in one week.

10:03.602 --> 10:06.147
No. You got 24 hours.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.524
Starting now.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.693
Come on, man, we're
supposed to be friends.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.361
Look, I am your friend.
Any other agent would have

10:12.445 --> 10:14.071
kicked your ass
to the curb long ago.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.239
Okay, well, yeah, and of course,

10:15.323 --> 10:16.699
I'm grateful
that you stood by me,

10:16.782 --> 10:18.743
but please, I mean...
Give me till Friday.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.703
You got till 10:15 tomorrow.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.663
Tweak fast.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.209
Are you having an affair?

10:27.293 --> 10:29.545
Really, Karl, before breakfast?

10:29.628 --> 10:31.297
No, I heard you on
the phone this morning.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.424
You were arguing
with someone,

10:33.507 --> 10:37.053
refusing to meet unless they
found a discreet location.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.597
You listened to
a private conversation?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.849
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Well, I am...

10:41.932 --> 10:44.268
after I've had sex
with a busboy in an alleyway,

10:44.352 --> 10:47.063
but I-I don't really break
a sweat over eavesdropping.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.065
Regardless, I don't owe you
any explanations,

10:49.148 --> 10:50.566
- so drop the subject.
- Oh, go on.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.068
Tell me who it is.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.111
Is it one of our friends
from the country club?

10:54.195 --> 10:56.989
The tennis instruct...
No, the chef.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.700
Karl, I believe you're jealous.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.243
Oh, don't be daft.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.828
Oh, by the way,

11:02.912 --> 11:05.247
if it is a busboy
named Julio,

11:05.331 --> 11:07.416
will you give him
my regards?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.461
Mm, the irony is just delicious.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.254
Is it one of our neighbors?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.590
Dig all you like, Karl.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.133
Even if I were
having an affair,

11:16.217 --> 11:19.053
you'd never hear
his name from me.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.640
We need to talk
about Tommy.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.186
The bed news is
he's been acting strangely.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.772
He leaves the house
at all hours of the night.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.941
Won't tell me where he's been
when he comes home.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.444
Oh, I do home Tommy hasn't
fallen in with the wrong crowd.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.113
Why are you looking at me?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.448
- I'm offering you a cookie.
- Oh.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.283
Right.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.412
The good news is
I got him a new job

11:44.495 --> 11:46.122
working for Bader's Nursery.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.665
He'll be doing home care.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.458
- Home care?
- That means he'll go

11:49.542 --> 11:51.293
into people's houses
and water their plants

11:51.377 --> 11:52.294
while they're at work

11:52.378 --> 11:53.838
or on vacation.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.089
Will he?

11:55.172 --> 11:56.632
This is where
the favor comes in.

11:56.715 --> 11:59.427
I'm asking all of my friends
to hire Tommy.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.345
I need to keep him busy.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.140
Just so I'm clear,
people leave town

12:04.223 --> 12:05.808
and give Tommy
the keys to their homes?

12:05.891 --> 12:08.769
I know what you're thinking,
but Tommy is

12:08.853 --> 12:11.439
very trustworthy...
and quick, too.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.607
He'd be in and out.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.485
I'm sure he'd stay long enough
to get the job done.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.487
Of course.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.614
Can I count you in?

12:20.698 --> 12:21.782
Oh, why not?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.075
We like Tommy,
don't we, darling?

12:23.159 --> 12:24.660
Oh, yes.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.121
We certainly do.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.330
Poor April.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.124
If you could
have seen her face.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.959
Oh, you don't want me
anywhere near that tramp's face

12:32.042 --> 12:33.794
because I will slap it.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.171
It's her big night.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.964
I was honored she wanted me
to come so badly.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.841
Doesn't she have
any other friends?

12:38.924 --> 12:41.469
Or did she sleep
with their husbands, too?

12:41.552 --> 12:42.720
I'm glad Rob is going.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.805
She needs someone there
to cheer her on.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.182
I don't get it.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.558
This is war.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.351
You are fighting
with another woman

12:49.435 --> 12:51.854
over your husband
and you are losing.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.731
Honey!

12:53.814 --> 12:56.192
He's home early.
I'm in here, Rob.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.860
If he tells you that he's got
to work late Tuesday,

12:57.943 --> 12:59.528
I will vomit
and you will have to mop

12:59.612 --> 13:01.530
this floor up all over again.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.032
There you are.
Guess what?

13:03.115 --> 13:05.743
I have amazing news.

13:05.826 --> 13:06.869
You do?

13:06.952 --> 13:09.747
I got two tickets
to the World Series.

13:09.830 --> 13:10.873
For when?

13:10.956 --> 13:13.542
Let me guess. Tuesday?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.419
As a matter of fact, yeah.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.505
My boss gave them to me
as a gift, and they

13:17.588 --> 13:20.466
- are right behind home plate.
- Who are you taking?

13:20.549 --> 13:21.675
What do you mean,
who am I taking?

13:21.759 --> 13:22.885
Only my best girl.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.553
Let me see those.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.182
Holy crap!

13:28.265 --> 13:30.935
He's got two tickets
to the World Series.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.019
Isn't that what I just said?

13:32.102 --> 13:33.062
And these are for Tuesday?

13:33.145 --> 13:35.064
Yeah.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.398
What's wrong?

13:36.482 --> 13:39.109
Well, I just want to make sure

13:39.193 --> 13:41.654
we haven't forgotten
about any plans

13:41.737 --> 13:44.240
we might have made for Tuesday?

13:44.323 --> 13:46.867
Well, whatever plans we made,
consider them canceled.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.162
I've got a date with my wife,
the Dodgers and the Yankees.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.164
Okay.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.208
What's going on here?
Why aren't you happy?

13:54.291 --> 13:57.586
Oh, she is very happy.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.256
She's just not used
to you being so wonderful.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.674
Oh.

14:01.757 --> 14:02.883
Huh?

14:02.967 --> 14:05.844
Rob, give us a second. We're not
through with the mopping.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.390
I got to call Carl.

14:09.473 --> 14:12.101
He's gonna be so
jealous.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.813
April is going
to be heartbroken.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.565
To hell with April.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.942
You've got to focus
on the big picture.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.821
He's choosing you
over her.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.031
You're winning.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.243
I guess I am.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.964
Hey. Taylor called.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.341
Her plane landed
in Fresno.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.595
What are you doing?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.640
Killing myself.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.642
- With cheese?
- Yeah. My plan is

14:53.726 --> 14:56.353
to get super fat
and then die of hypertension.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.647
That might take a while.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.525
Only great writers
deserve quick deaths.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.028
Hemingway, Wolfe, Plath.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.822
Me? I'm a bad writer,

15:06.905 --> 15:09.158
so I deserve
to die slowly,

15:09.241 --> 15:12.620
painfully... disgustingly.

15:14.913 --> 15:15.998
Do we have any mustard?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.750
No.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.668
But we have mayonnaise.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.338
Oh, yes, the condiment of hacks.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.882
Bring it to me.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.510
What's going on?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.349
My agent's gonna drop me

15:33.432 --> 15:35.517
if I don't get him my script
by tomorrow morning.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.479
And you're not finished?

15:38.562 --> 15:42.399
I-I've written 50 pages.
Each just worst than the last.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.151
I doubt that.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.736
I mean, I have no third act.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.237
I keep sitting here,

15:47.321 --> 15:48.697
staring at the poster
of my one and only hit,

15:48.781 --> 15:50.783
praying for some sort
of inspiration.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.243
And the longer I look at it,
the more I realize...

15:53.327 --> 15:54.870
it was a fluke.

15:54.953 --> 15:56.830
I mean, brilliant
director, stellar cast,

15:56.914 --> 15:58.916
all turning my crap dialogue
into gold.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.712
How am I gonna tell Taylor

16:03.796 --> 16:05.923
that I lost my fucking agent?

16:06.465 --> 16:09.093
Give me the 50 pages.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.011
Why, so you can
beat me with them?

16:11.095 --> 16:14.390
Because I think it might help
you to get some honest feedback.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.935
Do you know anything
about writing?

16:18.018 --> 16:19.728
I know what I like.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.897
And if I think that
your script's in decent shape,

16:21.980 --> 16:26.777
you'll have the confidence
to finish the damn thing.

16:26.860 --> 16:29.988
Yeah, and what if it's just
50 pages of me shitting the bed?

16:30.072 --> 16:33.325
Then I will go to the store
and I will buy you

16:33.409 --> 16:36.245
every kind of cheese
known to man.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.539
And mayonnaise.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.624
Gonna need lots of mayonnaise.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.087
Rob, what are you doing?
We're going to be late.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.089
I'm looking
for my old baseball glove.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.591
Maybe I can get Sandy Koufax
to sign it.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.594
Don't bother Mr. Koufax tonight.
He'll be working.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.221
Eh, he can sign one glove.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.724
Maybe it's in one of the boxes
in the garage.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.308
No, it should be in this one.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.102
Stanton residence.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.146
Hold on.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.773
Maybe you're right
about the garage.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.777
Check the box by the tool
drawer. I got to take this.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.446
Who is it?

17:10.529 --> 17:13.198
Uh, a guy from work.
Uh, I'll be right down.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.466
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

17:30.549 --> 17:33.051
I said never
to call me here.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.638
I already told you,
I got plans with my wife.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.348
She's making me
take her out to dinner.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.437
Don't cry. L-Look,
I hate it when you cry.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.855
There's nothing
I can do about this.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.398
Now-now I got to go.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.789
Well, you were right
about the garage.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.373
No sign of your glove.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.833
Eh, it doesn't matter.
Let's get going

18:04.917 --> 18:06.835
or we'll miss
the national anthem.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.837
Honey, I don't think I can go.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.005
What?

18:10.088 --> 18:12.549
I'm not feeling well.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.842
You look fine to me.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.469
Robert.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.971
You remember our trip
to New Mexico?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.848
You mean, you got...

18:19.932 --> 18:23.018
Yes. I should stay close
to a bathroom.

18:23.101 --> 18:24.686
Well, they got bathrooms
at the stadium.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.815
I could never do that
to total strangers.

18:29.107 --> 18:31.026
Want me to stay
home with you?

18:31.109 --> 18:33.028
Don't be silly.

18:33.111 --> 18:36.073
Oh, good. Thank God,
'cause I really want to go.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.074
Bye.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.498
April, it's Sheila.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.500
My aunt is fine.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.878
I can come hear you sing
after all.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.507
Yes. I'm happy, too.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.553
Ah.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.137
It is so good

18:59.221 --> 19:00.389
to see you guys.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.723
I just wish Mama
could've made it.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.891
How is she?

19:02.975 --> 19:05.185
- Nasty as ever.
- Mean as the day is long.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.729
We work our fingers
to the bone for that woman.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.731
But it's never good
enough for her.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.775
The doctor says
she could live to be 100.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.778
And she'll do it,
just to spite us.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.281
Well, look, I know she can be
difficult to care for,

19:17.364 --> 19:19.032
and I wish
I could help out more.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.409
Oh, don't worry about it, sugar.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.995
- We don't resent you.
- Not much, anyway.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.080
Would be nice if you could
take her off our hands

19:25.163 --> 19:26.582
every now and then.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.084
Got an extra room
in that big house of yours?

19:29.167 --> 19:30.544
Don't need to be fancy.

19:30.627 --> 19:32.129
Oh, it could be the
cellar for all we care.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.593
I would really like to help out,
but it would be tricky,

19:37.676 --> 19:40.053
given my current
living situation.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.930
Okay, I meant to lead
with this when I sat down,

19:42.014 --> 19:45.100
but the truth is...

19:45.183 --> 19:47.269
I am no longer in
an open marriage.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.146
- You left Eli?
- Thank you, Jesus.

19:49.229 --> 19:54.359
No, I didn't leave Eli, I
moved my lover into our home.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.321
The three of us are
officially a throuple.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.452
Would it be okay
if we tell Mama?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.621
'Cause this will kill her.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.645
Sheila.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.648
- Hi.
- Look at you.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.859
- You're lovely.
- Thanks.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.819
Oh, I'm so nervous.

20:37.903 --> 20:38.946
You're going to be great.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.864
Hey, kid,
you're on in ten.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.324
Oh, thank you, Mr. Porter.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.164
What are you looking for?

20:49.247 --> 20:52.167
It's silly.
Rob told me he can't make it.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.002
I just... I keep thinking
maybe he'll surprise me.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.755
Honey, you can't worry
about that right now.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.340
You've got a show to do.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.843
You're right. Thank you
so much for being here.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.470
Knock 'em dead.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.889

22:08.118 --> 22:10.245
The dialogue,
the scenes in the diner...

22:10.328 --> 22:11.913
Just-just skip to what sucks.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.916
That would be
your lead character.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.919
What's wrong with Eva?

22:18.003 --> 22:21.298
She waits around for 15 pages
hoping a man will save her.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.051
She's a victim. I hate victims.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.223
Yeah, yeah. Okay. I mean,
make her more proactive, sure.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.808
And can't she do
something interesting

22:31.892 --> 22:33.393
to get out of trouble?

22:33.477 --> 22:36.396
- What do you mean, interesting?
- Like, on page 40,

22:36.480 --> 22:42.110
she's abandoned at the diner
and totally broke, right?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.112
- Yeah.
- So, let her

22:44.196 --> 22:45.572
steal the owner's truck

22:45.655 --> 22:47.949
and then she drives
to the drug dealer's house

22:48.033 --> 22:49.743
and starts a fire.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.078
And when he runs
out the front,

22:51.161 --> 22:52.454
she goes in the back
and gets the money

22:52.537 --> 22:53.705
that he took from her.

22:53.789 --> 22:54.915
And his gun.

22:54.998 --> 22:56.917
She'd definitely take his gun.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.588
Wow. Um, I mean, i-it's
definitely more proactive.

23:01.671 --> 23:05.467
It's just... I don't know,
I-I never saw Eva that way.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.095
I mean, she's...
she's a nice girl.

23:08.178 --> 23:11.473
Yeah, but nice girls,
they break the law every day.

23:11.556 --> 23:15.185
When they need to.

23:15.268 --> 23:18.814
Okay. All right, I hear you.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.441
There's more to Eva
than meets the eye.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.318
Exactly.

23:23.401 --> 23:28.031
So now, get started, open
your laptop, get to work.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.283
You have 22 hours.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.663
Hey.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.540
How did you come up
with that stuff, anyway?

23:38.250 --> 23:41.378
Maybe there's more to <i>me</i>
than meets the eye.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.689
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.316
It's okay.
Are you clear on what to do?

24:03.400 --> 24:05.026
I guess.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.320
Are we sure about this?
I mean, if we get caught...

24:07.404 --> 24:09.739
Yes. It's very risky.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.200
I suppose the smart thing
to do is end this affair

24:12.284 --> 24:14.327
and never have sex again.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.579
Fine.

25:08.673 --> 25:12.302
I don't know why
Mrs. Dubner's bed feels amazing.

25:12.385 --> 25:15.889
It's the sheets.
They're Egyptian cotton.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.140
How do you know that?

25:17.224 --> 25:18.558
I used to wash
sheets like this

25:18.642 --> 25:20.268
when I worked in
my father's laundry.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.437
Your dad owned a laundry?

25:22.520 --> 25:25.357
You think I was born rich?

25:25.440 --> 25:27.317
Well... yeah.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.904
Not even close.

25:30.987 --> 25:35.992
When I was 12, I used
to covet things like this.

25:36.076 --> 25:40.455
Once, I took some
satin sheets home.

25:40.538 --> 25:42.624
I wanted to see
what it felt like

25:42.707 --> 25:44.751
to sleep on them,
just for one night.

25:44.834 --> 25:48.755
My mother caught me.
She was so angry.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.840
She made me wash
and iron them right there.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.175
It was 2:00 in the morning.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.094
And then she took them away.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.644
- That's a shame.
- Mm.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.818
Mother said, "If you want
to sleep on expensive sheets,

26:09.901 --> 26:12.320
choose wisely
who you sleep next to."

26:12.404 --> 26:16.157
So, uh, she basically told you
to marry for money.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.201
That's, uh, some
really bad advice.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.412
Well, I followed it twice.

26:20.495 --> 26:24.749
I didn't think of marrying
for love until Karl.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.587
I never told that story before.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.717
To anyone.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.179
Thanks for telling me first.

26:38.263 --> 26:42.142
If you really want to <i>thank</i> me,

26:42.225 --> 26:43.143
get over here.

26:50.233 --> 26:53.653
Oh, I feel so badly about this.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.990
After you went
to all the trouble

26:57.073 --> 26:59.034
of taking me to the airport.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.368
It's fine, Joyce.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.536
Nobody expects you
to get on a plane

27:01.619 --> 27:03.538
when you're feeling ill.

27:03.621 --> 27:06.708
Oh, it's the plant van.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.544
Tommy must be here.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.386
So, finally,
I confessed to Eli

27:18.470 --> 27:20.305
how much Jade meant to me,
and he agreed

27:20.388 --> 27:23.141
to let her live
with us, permanently.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.771
Yes, I know,
it's unconventional,

27:27.854 --> 27:30.065
and you probably don't approve,

27:30.148 --> 27:34.152
but... it's working.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.571
Well, as long as
you're happy.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.114
That's what matters.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.575
Really?

27:40.658 --> 27:42.118
That's all you have to say?

27:43.453 --> 27:45.288
Since you asked,
I have a question.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.207
- Here we go.
- Do you still love Eli?

27:47.290 --> 27:49.084
- Of course.
- And you also love this woman?

27:49.167 --> 27:50.168
Yes.

27:50.251 --> 27:53.046
I'm wondering, how do they
feel about each other?

27:55.006 --> 27:57.884
Oh. Well...

27:57.967 --> 27:59.260
I knew she hadn't
thought it through.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.262
- Hadn't even crossed her mind.
- Mm-hmm.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.597
Hold on. Eli and Jade
like each other.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.265
That's not a problem.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.601
Not yet. What happens when
he likes her more than you?

28:06.684 --> 28:08.395
What happens when she
gets tired of sharing?

28:08.478 --> 28:10.688
- Where does that leave you, missy?
- On the outside

28:10.772 --> 28:12.607
looking in, that's where.

28:12.690 --> 28:13.817
That's not gonna happen.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.445
It's not.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.864
Obviously, we don't know Jade.

28:19.948 --> 28:20.907
So we can't judge her.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.158
But we know Eli.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.952
We saw what he put you through.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.662
Yes, we went through
a dark time,

28:25.745 --> 28:27.205
but that was two years ago.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.791
"A dark time"?
The man's a drug addict.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.918
Half your savings
went up his nose.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.087
The man's incapable
of self-control.

28:34.170 --> 28:36.297
And now he's got
another woman in his bed?

28:36.381 --> 28:37.841
The hell did you think
was gonna happen?

28:37.924 --> 28:40.135
Stop it!

28:40.218 --> 28:41.261
I know you're trying
to bait me,

28:41.344 --> 28:42.971
but it's not gonna work.

28:43.054 --> 28:46.349
I'm telling you,
Eli has changed.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.644
Oh, baby sister,
men never change.

28:49.727 --> 28:51.813
They just get better
at keeping secrets.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.773
Mm.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.074
Hello?

29:04.075 --> 29:05.243
It's Mrs. Dubner.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.786
You said she was
going to France.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.121
Yeah, my mom took her
to the airport this morning.

29:08.204 --> 29:11.666
Tommy, where are you?

29:11.749 --> 29:14.377
- Oh!
- You have to hide!

29:14.461 --> 29:15.837
Make the bed.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.173
I can't do both.

29:18.256 --> 29:21.134
I know you think I'm
a ridiculous hypochondriac,

29:21.217 --> 29:22.343
but the pain is real.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.511
You'll be fine.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.014
You just need to
lie down in your room.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.975
Mrs. Dubner.
Did you miss your flight?

29:29.058 --> 29:30.685
I'm having a migraine.
I need to rest.

29:30.768 --> 29:34.355
No, uh...
you can't go in there.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.690
Why not?

29:35.773 --> 29:39.569
I, uh, just sprayed.

29:39.652 --> 29:40.987
Sprayed?

29:41.070 --> 29:43.990
Uh, insecticide.

29:44.073 --> 29:47.202
Your, uh, your ficus had
a white fly.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.370
- I've never seen any white fly.
- Yeah, well, they're...

29:49.454 --> 29:51.831
they're pretty tiny...
see?

29:51.915 --> 29:53.458
Oh, my God. Kill it!

29:53.541 --> 29:55.502
See, I-I didn't know that
you would be back so soon,

29:55.585 --> 29:57.712
so I used a very
strong insecticide.

29:57.795 --> 29:59.839
You inhale those fumes
with a migraine and...

30:01.299 --> 30:03.718
You're right.
I can smell it.

30:03.801 --> 30:05.386
Yeah, y-you better stay
downstairs.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.639
Don't just stand there,
help her down.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.527
We need you to run
to the pharmacy.

30:20.610 --> 30:21.611
Now?

30:21.694 --> 30:23.071
I'm out of medication.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.906
Here's my prescription.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.992
I should go open
some windows in the bedroom.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.077
To air it out.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.578
Oh, hurry.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.163
Joyce is in agony.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.462
Joyce is sick. I have
to go to the drugstore.

30:39.546 --> 30:40.755
Well, how am I supposed
to get out of here?

30:40.838 --> 30:42.090
I don't know.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.648
- Hello?
- Karl, it's me. I need your help.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.775
Speak up, I can hardly hear you.

31:00.858 --> 31:02.610
I'm trapped in
Joyce Dubner's house.

31:02.694 --> 31:06.030
Oh, dear, is she telling
her appendectomy story again?

31:06.114 --> 31:07.782
She doesn't know I'm here,
and neither does Naomi.

31:07.865 --> 31:10.285
Sorry, Naomi's there?

31:10.368 --> 31:12.245
Yes, and I'm trapped upstairs.

31:12.328 --> 31:15.832
Upstairs?

31:15.915 --> 31:17.750
Would this have anything to do
with the affair

31:17.834 --> 31:19.586
you're not having?

31:19.669 --> 31:21.129
Now is not the time!

31:21.212 --> 31:23.631
Oh, what a nasty tone.
I think I'm gonna hang up.

31:23.715 --> 31:24.882
All right, all right,
fine, fine.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.134
I'm having an affair.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.802
Now can you please
come over here

31:27.885 --> 31:29.887
and create a distraction
so I can get out?

31:32.140 --> 31:33.891
What are husbands for?

31:37.395 --> 31:39.230
Eli?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.191
Hey, Eli.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.153
Eli, hey.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.113
- Hmm?
- You fell asleep.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.824
- Oh, my God, what time is it?
- It's 4:00 in the morning.

31:49.907 --> 31:53.161
What? Oh, shit.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.121
- How much have you done?
- 61 pages.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.831
The good news is that
I think the story's working,

31:56.914 --> 31:58.207
but, I mean, I don't know,
I can't tell,

31:58.291 --> 32:00.335
'cause I'm just so tired
I can't even think.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.461
Well, you have to keep going.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.671
- Lamar expects the script by breakfast.
- I know, I know.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.340
I've been writing
for ten hours straight.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.008
Believe me when I tell you
that there is no tank left

32:07.091 --> 32:08.843
in the gas.

32:08.926 --> 32:11.971
Wait. No, that's right.

32:12.055 --> 32:15.016
Hold on, I have something.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.186
Ah.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.812
Here we go.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.357
Take this.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.983
What is that?

32:24.067 --> 32:25.902
I get pills to help
with my ADHD.

32:25.985 --> 32:28.488
They give you a lift
and they help you focus.

32:28.571 --> 32:31.866
Uh... I don't think I should.

32:31.949 --> 32:33.326
It's fine.
It's not a big deal.

32:33.409 --> 32:34.911
Like, college kids
take them all the time

32:34.994 --> 32:36.454
to cram for midterms and shit.

32:38.122 --> 32:41.876
Yeah... No, thank you.

32:41.959 --> 32:44.629
Okay, it's your choice.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.384
- Fuck it, give me the pill.
- Are you sure?

32:49.467 --> 32:52.512
Yes, yes. I need
to finish the script.

33:15.868 --> 33:18.496
Eli. What are you doing here?

33:18.579 --> 33:20.248
Hand-delivering you my script.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.582
You couldn't send it by e-mail?

33:21.666 --> 33:23.209
No, no, no, I could not,
because I needed

33:23.292 --> 33:25.628
to look you in the eye
when I told you

33:25.712 --> 33:26.713
that it's not done.

33:26.796 --> 33:29.048
- Oh, come on...
- But, <i>but,</i>

33:29.132 --> 33:31.342
I finished 80 pages,
and it's great.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.302
So great that
you're gonna call me,

33:33.386 --> 33:34.929
and you're going to apologize
for ever considering

33:35.012 --> 33:36.013
dropping me as a client.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.765
You're gonna say, "Eli,
this is fucking brilliant.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.392
"I can't fucking wait
to see how it ends.

33:39.475 --> 33:42.270
You, my friend, are one fucking
talented motherfucker."

33:45.189 --> 33:48.526
Hey, sweetie.

33:48.609 --> 33:50.027
I didn't see you there.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.322
I'm shutting the door now.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.491
As well you should.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.833
I found your sleep mask.

34:03.916 --> 34:06.586
Bring it here.
There's too much light.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.576
What the hell was that?!

34:41.412 --> 34:45.583
Somebody just rammed
into my car.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.053
Karl?

34:59.972 --> 35:01.682
- What have you done?
- I'm so sorry.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.809
I-I swerved

35:02.892 --> 35:05.978
to avoid a kitten.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.647
Isn't this Joyce Dubner's house?

35:07.730 --> 35:09.315
Yes.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.484
So, where-where's Joyce?

35:12.985 --> 35:15.530
Naomi? You're back quickly.

35:15.613 --> 35:16.906
What happened out there?

35:18.282 --> 35:19.700
Naomi?

35:21.828 --> 35:23.913
Oh, you must be inhaling fumes.

35:23.996 --> 35:25.414
You better get some water.

35:52.608 --> 35:55.027
Hey...

35:55.111 --> 35:56.737
What happened here?

35:56.821 --> 36:00.366
I just brought Joyce home
from the airport.

36:00.449 --> 36:03.744
She's ill, and your husband
just crashed into my car.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.121
Yes,
and I was out for a drive

36:05.204 --> 36:07.248
and had to swerve
to avoid hitting a puppy.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.541
I thought it was a kitten.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.084
Well, it had fur
and moved quickly.

36:10.167 --> 36:11.419
Anyway, crash.

36:11.502 --> 36:14.255
Oh, good, Tommy's back.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.548
Back?

36:15.631 --> 36:17.258
Well, he was here
spraying the plants

36:17.341 --> 36:18.759
in Joyce's bedroom,

36:18.843 --> 36:21.637
and I sent him to the drugstore
for her pills.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.723
Well, wasn't that lucky, dear?

36:23.806 --> 36:26.100
Seems Tommy was
right there in the bedroom

36:26.183 --> 36:28.102
ready to be useful.

36:28.185 --> 36:30.479
Well, I'll see you
at home, Karl.

36:30.563 --> 36:31.898
I have to finish
my jog.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.232
Do you, darling?

36:33.316 --> 36:35.359
'Cause I'm pretty sure
the jog is up.

36:42.825 --> 36:45.745
I can't understand why you're not happy.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.580
Tonight was a triumph.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.123
You should be dancing
in the street.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.292
Yeah. I know.

36:51.375 --> 36:54.462
Guess I just really hoped
Rob would show up.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.339
Sweetie, it's going to be okay.

36:56.422 --> 36:58.466
No, it's not.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.969
It's not going to be okay
ever again.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.804
Well, why not?

37:03.888 --> 37:06.265
Because I'm falling
in love with him.

37:12.688 --> 37:14.774
Eli?

37:16.567 --> 37:18.194
What's going on?

37:18.277 --> 37:21.113
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.368
I just got a call from Lamar.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.912
Okay. What did he say?

37:27.995 --> 37:31.791
He said it's the best thing
I've ever written.

37:31.874 --> 37:34.669
- Really?
- Yeah. He said it's smart

37:34.752 --> 37:37.546
and exciting
and that the character of Eva

37:37.630 --> 37:40.925
is "deliciously complex."

37:42.593 --> 37:45.137
And then he told me to not
fuck up the ending, but, I mean,

37:45.221 --> 37:47.932
the point is, he loved it.

37:48.015 --> 37:50.184
- I'm so happy for you.
- Oh, my God.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.061
How do I even begin
to say thank you?

37:52.144 --> 37:53.521
I didn't do much.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.356
Yes, you did.
You know you did.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.191
And if I was actually good
at what I do,

37:57.274 --> 37:59.026
I would come up with something
better than just "thank you,"

37:59.110 --> 38:00.528
but for now,

38:00.611 --> 38:01.904
that's all I got,
so thank you.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.282
- No, look, I'll take it, I'll take it. Oh.
- Thank you, thank you.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.034
Congrats.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.423
Oh, uh...

38:20.506 --> 38:23.009
A-Are we allowed to do this
without Taylor?

38:23.092 --> 38:26.721
I'm not...
not sure.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.193
You think I'm stupid, don't you?

38:41.277 --> 38:44.280
I would never say that.

38:44.363 --> 38:47.241
Now this
was not the plan.

38:47.324 --> 38:49.410
I was not supposed
to care this much.

38:49.493 --> 38:52.288
When he didn't
show up tonight,

38:52.371 --> 38:55.374
it just... hit me.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.919
What am I gonna do now?

38:59.003 --> 39:02.089
I have a hunch
he's happier at home

39:02.173 --> 39:04.717
than he's led you to believe.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.636
Which means he'll continue
to disappoint you.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.599
You don't need that
right now.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.602
Your career is finally
taking off.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.604
You should be
enjoying this time,

39:16.687 --> 39:19.732
not mooning over some
other woman's husband.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.984
I mean, why would he
even be with me

39:22.068 --> 39:23.944
if he was so happy with her?

39:29.408 --> 39:31.494
Maybe she did something
to hurt him

39:31.577 --> 39:33.621
and he needs time
to forgive her.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.165
I don't really understand that.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.128
It's late.
I should go.

39:41.212 --> 39:44.465
And you should
get some sleep.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.717
Sheila.

39:48.302 --> 39:51.180
You are such a good friend.

39:52.932 --> 39:55.184
I think you're maybe
the best I've ever had.

39:55.267 --> 39:59.605
You really were
wonderful tonight.

40:27.007 --> 40:27.925
Um...

40:28.008 --> 40:29.218
I need to use your bathroom.

40:29.301 --> 40:30.678
Oh, uh, it's a mess.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.846
Can I just clean up first?

40:31.929 --> 40:34.223
No!

40:34.306 --> 40:36.100
Is everything okay?

40:37.685 --> 40:40.855
Um, I...
I may be in here a while.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.861
Oh...

40:49.113 --> 40:50.698
Hey, baby.

40:50.781 --> 40:53.659
Rob. Hi... What are you,
what are you doing here?

40:53.742 --> 40:55.911
I wanted to come hear
about your show.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.872
Oh,
it went great.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.748
Oh, good.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.625
Mm, we should celebrate.

41:03.627 --> 41:06.922
Oh, I can't. My friend is here.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.924
I don't see anybody.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.510
She's in the bathroom.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.558
What's wrong
with her?

41:17.641 --> 41:21.228
I think she
has diarrhea.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.522
Lot of that
going around.

41:25.524 --> 41:28.277
Come here.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.237
Can we talk tomorrow?

41:30.321 --> 41:32.239
I'm here now.

41:32.323 --> 41:35.910
- Now is not a good time.
- Mm.

41:35.993 --> 41:38.204
And I have something
important to tell you.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.123
Don't tell him. Not now.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.375
What is it?

41:43.459 --> 41:46.712
- No. You're drunk.
- I had two beers.

41:46.795 --> 41:50.799
Come on, give me, give me a hint.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.801
Well...

41:52.885 --> 41:57.056
I have been doing
a lot of thinking about us,

41:57.139 --> 41:59.725
and I realized something.

41:59.808 --> 42:00.935
Are you breaking up
with me?

42:01.018 --> 42:02.811
God, no.

42:02.895 --> 42:04.813
Okay.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.358
I'm in love with you.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.613
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.616
I just... I just thought
it would be nice to know

42:15.699 --> 42:17.284
how you felt
about me.

42:19.578 --> 42:21.413
I'm not leaving my wife.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.832
Yeah, no, I'm not asking you to.

42:23.916 --> 42:25.084
See, I think you are.

42:26.877 --> 42:31.465
I think you're too drunk
to have this conversation.

42:31.548 --> 42:32.925
When you start using
the "L word,"

42:33.008 --> 42:34.635
a guy can sober up pretty quick.

42:34.718 --> 42:36.679
You don't love me?

42:36.762 --> 42:38.138
I think you're great.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.933
You think I'm great?

42:41.016 --> 42:42.518
That's your response?

42:42.601 --> 42:44.979
You knew the rules.
I was very clear.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.481
I will never leave my wife!

42:47.564 --> 42:49.692
- Please don't yell at me.
- Well, you're making me angry!

42:49.775 --> 42:51.777
Okay, okay, okay.

42:51.860 --> 42:54.113
I-I...

42:57.116 --> 43:01.495
So...

43:01.578 --> 43:04.123
where does that leave me?

43:04.206 --> 43:05.624
I don't know.

43:06.959 --> 43:10.004
I think that
you should go.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.867
You okay?

43:39.950 --> 43:43.704
Yeah, he usually doesn't speak
to me that way.

43:43.787 --> 43:46.707
He's normally very kind.

43:46.790 --> 43:49.710
Oh, honey.

43:56.467 --> 44:00.012
Well, I hope his wife
appreciates how lucky she is.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.601
I'm not sure she's that lucky.

44:09.646 --> 44:10.939
So...

44:11.023 --> 44:12.775
Tommy Harte.

44:12.858 --> 44:15.027
I know he's a bit young...

44:15.110 --> 44:18.155
A bit? When I met him,
he was eight.

44:18.238 --> 44:19.948
And you were heterosexual.

44:20.032 --> 44:23.035
And now this child
is your lover?

44:23.118 --> 44:24.745
Who knew there was
such a fine line

44:24.828 --> 44:26.747
between adultery
and day care?

44:26.830 --> 44:29.208
Bugger off, Karl.
You have no right to judge me.

44:29.291 --> 44:30.918
I'm not judging you,

44:31.001 --> 44:32.419
I'm just teasing.

44:32.503 --> 44:35.255
If anything,
I'm happy for us. Drink?

44:35.339 --> 44:38.258
Brandy. What do you mean
you're happy for us?

44:38.342 --> 44:42.596
Well, don't you see?
We don't need to get a divorce.

44:42.679 --> 44:46.350
We have stumbled into
the perfect arrangement.

44:46.433 --> 44:48.435
You will have your lovers
and I will have mine,

44:48.519 --> 44:51.772
and then we will come home
to sparkling conversation.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.649
It's very European.

44:53.732 --> 44:56.985
It doesn't bother you that I'm
having sex with someone else?

44:57.069 --> 44:58.946
Darling, I'm gay.

44:59.029 --> 45:02.950
Look, for me, sex with a woman
is like emptying the dishwasher.

45:03.033 --> 45:04.618
I mean, I'll do it if I'm asked,

45:04.701 --> 45:06.912
but if someone else volunteers,
I won't complain.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.961
Oh. You know I love this shirt.

45:14.044 --> 45:16.505
You might've asked for vodka.

45:16.588 --> 45:18.966
I don't understand.
How can you not be jealous?

45:19.049 --> 45:22.428
Sorry, wait, you want me
to be jealous of Tommy Harte?

45:22.511 --> 45:24.972
He's jealous of you!

45:25.055 --> 45:26.932
So he should be.
I'm the husband.

45:27.015 --> 45:28.684
Not for long.

45:28.767 --> 45:30.811
Oh, what are you gonna do,
divorce me and marry Tommy?

45:30.894 --> 45:32.980
- Maybe I will.
- Oh, good. Well, I'll get you a gift.

45:33.063 --> 45:36.024
Where will you be registered?
Fisher-Price?

45:36.108 --> 45:39.319
Everything is not a joke, Karl.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.488
You're not being funny,
you're being cruel.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.991
Oh, darling, I'm not trying
to be cruel. I love you.

45:44.074 --> 45:46.160
No, you don't!

45:46.243 --> 45:47.995
Not the way I need.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.830
I want a man
who loves me so much

45:49.913 --> 45:52.875
that he would kill another man
if I slept with someone else.

45:54.126 --> 45:56.670
And I'm never gonna get that
from you, am I?

45:56.753 --> 45:58.964
No.

46:03.594 --> 46:05.804
But you're my best friend.

46:05.888 --> 46:08.307
It's not enough.

46:21.153 --> 46:23.197
Shit.

46:27.284 --> 46:29.369
Yeah? Hey, babe.

46:29.453 --> 46:32.414
Hey. Why are you whispering?

46:32.498 --> 46:35.667
Oh, I was just, I was writing,
so, you know...

46:35.751 --> 46:38.337
...takes me a minute to get out
of the "in my head" voice

46:38.420 --> 46:40.714
and back into the
"out loud" voice.

46:40.797 --> 46:43.592
- How did everything go?
- Oh, the conference was great,

46:43.675 --> 46:47.596
and my sisters...
are my sisters.

46:47.679 --> 46:50.057
- Yeah.
- Look, if you're working, I don't want to stop you.

46:50.140 --> 46:53.060
Um, is Jade up?
I can talk to her.

46:53.143 --> 46:56.522
Uh...

46:56.605 --> 46:59.024
I-I-I think she's
walking the dog.

47:01.818 --> 47:05.072
It's a little late for that, no?

47:05.155 --> 47:07.741
Yeah, but, you know...

47:07.824 --> 47:09.701
dog can't tell time, so...

47:15.332 --> 47:18.377
I'm, uh...
I'm glad you checked in.

47:18.460 --> 47:22.130
Yeah. Um, I love you.

47:22.214 --> 47:24.216
I love you, too.
