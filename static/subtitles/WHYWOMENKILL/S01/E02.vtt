<i>Previously on</i> Why Women Kill...

00:11.136 --> 00:12.095
Hello.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.388
Sheila Mosconi.

00:13.471 --> 00:14.889
It was lovely to meet you.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.934
<i>Rob kissed a blonde waitress.</i>

00:18.017 --> 00:19.144
Not Rob.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.311
Not after
what happened

00:20.395 --> 00:21.771
to our daughter.

00:21.855 --> 00:22.772
<i>Beth Ann,</i>

00:22.856 --> 00:24.065
confront the girl.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.775
She might not even know
that Rob is married.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.694
Can I get you
some coffee to start?

00:29.612 --> 00:31.156
You look like you could use
someone to talk to,

00:31.239 --> 00:32.615
and we're slow right now.

00:32.699 --> 00:33.616
What is your name?

00:33.700 --> 00:35.285
Sheila.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.287
Tommy, what's this?

00:37.370 --> 00:39.497
I don't know, was
here when I came in.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.624
<i>Is he the only one,</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:42.792
<i>or have there been others?</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:44.586
Here's what's
going to happen.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.129
You will go upstairs
to begin packing.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.839
You won't come down
until everyone's gone.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.632
Do you understand?
I will not be humiliated.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.717
What did you do?

00:50.800 --> 00:53.303
You think you're gonna
get out of this by dying?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.679
Fuck you!

00:54.763 --> 00:56.055
Tommy.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.974
I've wanted to that
since I was 13.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.517
Well, how old are you now?

00:59.601 --> 01:00.560
I'm 18.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.978
I think you should go.

01:03.772 --> 01:04.689
Hello.

01:04.773 --> 01:05.815
Hey, what's up?

01:05.899 --> 01:06.816
What?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.276
Who was that?

01:08.359 --> 01:10.528
My friend Jade...
she has this crazy ex.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.155
Oh... you fucking her?

01:12.238 --> 01:13.990
- Don't be mad.
- About what?

01:14.073 --> 01:15.283
Jade's outside.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.284
You've become
emotionally involved.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.660
That is an insult to me

01:17.744 --> 01:19.829
and the sacred institution
known as open marriage.

01:21.247 --> 01:21.998
All right, fine, one night.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.792
I told her
she could stay the weekend.

01:23.875 --> 01:24.667
Hey.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.127
Thank you so much
for letting me stay.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.505
I really, really appreciate it.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.089
- Oh.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.299
This is crazy.

01:31.382 --> 01:32.091
I can't believe this.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.593
I'm staying with the guy
who wrote

01:33.676 --> 01:34.677
my favorite movie.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.764
If Jade needed to stay
here a couple extra weeks,

01:37.847 --> 01:39.724
it's no problem.

01:44.979 --> 01:49.025
<i>I lived next
door to a nice married couple.</i>

01:50.276 --> 01:53.029
<i>They seemed very much in love.</i>

01:55.031 --> 01:58.743
<i>Until the night
someone heard gunshots,</i>

01:58.827 --> 02:00.912
<i>and the police were called.</i>

02:00.995 --> 02:03.206
<i>They said one
of those nice people</i>

02:03.289 --> 02:05.708
<i>had been murdered.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:09.003
<i>I asked my mother how something
like that could happen.</i>

02:09.087 --> 02:11.673
<i>All she said was,</i>

02:11.756 --> 02:13.842
<i>"Marriage is harder
than it looks."</i>

02:17.595 --> 02:22.183
<i>Years later, a rich couple
moved into that same house.</i>

02:22.267 --> 02:25.061
<i>I always thought
they seemed happy.</i>

02:29.649 --> 02:32.235
<i>Until the police came back,</i>

02:32.318 --> 02:34.404
<i>and I saw the body.</i>

02:34.487 --> 02:36.489
<i>The rumor was</i>

02:36.573 --> 02:38.950
<i>one of the rich people
had killed the other.</i>

02:39.033 --> 02:42.078
<i>I asked my fianc√©e
what she thought had happened.</i>

02:43.371 --> 02:45.164
<i>All she said was,</i>

02:45.248 --> 02:47.542
<i>"Death is cheaper
than divorce."</i>

02:51.462 --> 02:54.215
<i>Last year yet another couple</i>

02:54.299 --> 02:58.136
<i>came to live
in the house next door.</i>

02:58.219 --> 03:02.181
<i>They were young and seemed
to have so much to live for.</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:07.061
<i>But, sadly,</i>

03:07.145 --> 03:10.773
<i>I heard the sirens
one more time.</i>

03:14.235 --> 03:17.947
<i>I arrived at the crime scene to
have my worst fears confirmed.</i>

03:23.328 --> 03:25.413
<i>I turned to my wife and said,</i>

03:25.496 --> 03:28.291
<i>"Another love story
has ended in murder.</i>

03:28.374 --> 03:30.627
<i>I can't believe it."</i>

03:30.710 --> 03:33.630
<i>My wife looked at me and said,</i>

03:33.713 --> 03:35.757
<i>"I can."</i>

05:20.445 --> 05:23.072
That looks delicious.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.075
You know, you're starting
to become one of my regulars.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.119
What is this, your
second time this week?

05:28.202 --> 05:29.746
My third.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.915
I'm afraid I don't have much
to occupy my days,

05:32.999 --> 05:35.251
being a lonely widow
in a new town.

05:35.334 --> 05:39.589
Sheila, you never told me that
your husband died. I'm so sorry.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.592
Don't be. It happens.
Do you have a fella?

05:42.675 --> 05:45.261
- Well, um...
- Of course you do.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.264
You're so pretty.
What's his name?

05:48.347 --> 05:51.434
Um... Rob.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.604
Tell me about him.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.108
I-I can't. Not here.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.444
It's kind of a
complicated situation.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.946
I understand.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.990
Understand what?

06:06.074 --> 06:09.911
Clearly, you're dating
a married man.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.915
How did you know that?

06:13.998 --> 06:16.918
You used the word "complicated."
What else could it mean?

06:17.001 --> 06:18.795
Oh, u-um...

06:18.878 --> 06:22.381
Please don't tell anyone.
I'm not proud of it.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.634
Of course you're not.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.636
Don't worry.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.346
I can keep a secret.

06:28.429 --> 06:29.680
Thank you.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.849
I do have one question.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.061
Has your married man
ever told you

06:35.144 --> 06:36.813
why he feels the need to cheat?

06:36.896 --> 06:39.607
Uh... what?

06:39.690 --> 06:41.984
M-My husband had an affair,

06:42.068 --> 06:45.196
but he died
before I could find out why.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.948
Naturally, I'm curious.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.076
I'm... sure it was a
completely different situation.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.620
Or maybe it was
exactly the same. Who knows?

06:52.703 --> 06:55.039
- Has Rob said anything?
- Not really, no.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.501
I assume it's just the obvious:
he was bored with his wife.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.961
Bored?

07:00.044 --> 07:01.295
Check, please.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.966
You know how
housewives can be.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.843
They forget that their
husbands need more

07:06.926 --> 07:08.845
than hot meals
and clean socks.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.806
Men want excitement
and passion.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.016
Lots of women just forget to
put in that kind of an effort.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.768
They don't change
their hair.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.146
They always wear the
same dowdy clothes.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.315
Oh.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.693
- Can I get you anything else?
- No.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.780
You've already given me
more than enough to chew on.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.040
Oh, hello.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.709
How long have
you been here?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.377
About an hour or so.

07:41.460 --> 07:42.712
How are you feeling?

07:42.795 --> 07:45.214
Eh.
You know, it's funny.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.926
You, uh, you attempt suicide
with a bottle of sleeping pills,

07:49.010 --> 07:52.180
and when you finally
wake up, they sedate you.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.515
God, what were you thinking?

07:54.599 --> 07:57.351
Look, I was ashamed
of the pain I had caused.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.228
And you thought your death
would cause me less pain?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.105
It was stupid and selfish.
I'm sorry.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.107
Well, just tell me
you won't try it again.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.234
- I won't.
- Say it.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.071
I won't try
and kill myself again.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.616
Good.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.620
The doctors say
you can go home this afternoon.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.455
Well, that's your
call, not theirs.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.081
Can I come home?

08:19.165 --> 08:21.417
Well, I've thought about it...
I still want a divorce.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.628
But there's no need
to rush things.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.755
You can stay at the house,
and then after a while,

08:25.838 --> 08:26.756
we'll separate.

08:26.839 --> 08:27.840
Amicably.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.050
Charmingly.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.469
- Charmingly?
- I want people to envy

08:31.552 --> 08:33.930
our divorce the same way
they envied our marriage.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.098
God forbid our friends
should ever pity you.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.352
Our friends don't feel pity,
only schadenfreude.

08:40.519 --> 08:42.521
And when would we separate?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.357
Oh, sometime in July.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.734
Ah.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.070
After your daughter's wedding.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.488
We've been planning all year
to make sure

08:50.571 --> 08:52.240
every detail is perfect.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.783
And why upstage her?

08:53.866 --> 08:55.660
Exactly. You love Amy
as much as I do.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.120
You wouldn't want to ruin
her special day with a divorce.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.080
No.

08:59.163 --> 09:00.122
Or a scandal.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.624
Of course not.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.334
Or a suicide.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.460
Oh, for God's sake, Simone!

09:04.543 --> 09:06.921
Sorry, darling, but with
what I've spent on this wedding,

09:07.004 --> 09:08.673
I had to make sure.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.591
<i>Guys.</i>

09:10.675 --> 09:12.593
- You don't need to wait on me.
- No, no, no.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.095
No. You are our guest.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.930
And you're recovering
from a traumatic event.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.099
I'm not worried
about Duke anymore.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.684
He stopped texting me.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.018
So, what's his deal?

09:21.102 --> 09:22.812
- Is he crazy?
- A little.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.106
He was always accusing me
of cheating on him.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.941
Of course, I was,

09:27.024 --> 09:29.110
but I would have
appreciated a little trust.

09:30.569 --> 09:32.488
Did Duke know about you two?

09:32.572 --> 09:35.449
Sure, yeah. Mostly
because of how we met.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.118
Okay, come on.

09:37.201 --> 09:38.786
How did you meet?

09:38.869 --> 09:40.496
You never told him the story?

09:40.579 --> 09:42.832
Well, we don't usually share
stories about our playmates.

09:42.915 --> 09:43.833
Share,

09:43.916 --> 09:44.959
just this once.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.837
Okay.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.673
I was selling lingerie
at Agent Provocateur.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.342
Solid opening scene. Go on.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.219
Well, I was there
to buy a few bras.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.637
- Red lace?
- No.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.847
The kind <i>I</i> like.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.307
Oh.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.184
So, I was in the fitting room
taking my top off

10:02.268 --> 10:04.562
- when the zipper gets caught in my hair.
- So she sticks her head out

10:04.645 --> 10:06.522
and is all...

10:06.605 --> 10:09.066
- "Can you come in here for a sec?"
- Mm-hmm.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.526
What are you doing?

10:11.569 --> 10:13.029
Nothing.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.364
You had your eyes closed.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.991
Yeah, I'm just trying
to picture it.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.868
Don't. It's pervy.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.245
Okay. Uh, so, what happened

10:21.329 --> 10:23.372
after you helped my wife
out of her sweater,

10:23.456 --> 10:25.082
he asked in a non-pervy way.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.500
We did it.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.545
Right there in
the fitting room.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.339
Sex in a fitting room.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.882
Bravo.
That was just...

10:32.965 --> 10:34.550
Bravo.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.552
And I am
so gonna close my eyes later.

10:36.635 --> 10:37.845
Anyway, that was

10:37.928 --> 10:40.598
six months ago, and
we're still together.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.183
Six months?

10:42.266 --> 10:43.934
Yeah.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.897
Uh, you told me that you met
Jade just a few weeks ago.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.733
I'm pretty sure
I said "months."

10:50.816 --> 10:53.069
No. No.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.196
You absolutely did not.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.241
Well, obviously
I made a mistake.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.743
Who wants dessert?

11:00.826 --> 11:02.745
- I got fortune cookies.
- Actually, I was hoping

11:02.828 --> 11:04.538
we could jump
in the hot tub.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.707
Were you?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.751
If it's okay with you guys.

11:09.794 --> 11:10.920
Um...

11:11.003 --> 11:12.463
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you know what?

11:12.546 --> 11:15.216
I'm not really in the mood
for cookies.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.426
Why don't I run down to
that pie shop you like,

11:17.510 --> 11:19.970
pick up some pecan?

11:20.054 --> 11:21.597
You guys... get in the hot tub,

11:21.680 --> 11:23.599
have a nice little soak
until I get back.

11:23.682 --> 11:24.892
That sounds amazing.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.310
Doesn't that sound amazing?

11:26.394 --> 11:28.437
Yeah, you don't mind?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.564
Not at all.

12:34.295 --> 12:37.214
Honey, I'm home.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.341
Where are you?

12:41.635 --> 12:43.679
I'm right here, darling.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.273
I've missed you.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.651
Is dinner ready?

12:58.652 --> 13:01.322
Uh... not yet.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.324
I've had a
hell of day.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.284
I'm gonna go fix myself a drink.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.911
Let me know when
food's on the table.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.921
So you had a rough day?

13:17.004 --> 13:18.714
The worst.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.508
My best engineer quit today,

13:20.591 --> 13:23.052
my secretary called in sick,
and on top of all that,

13:23.135 --> 13:24.929
I took my boss's briefcase

13:25.012 --> 13:26.347
home by mistake.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.681
I hope

13:27.765 --> 13:29.308
your day was better than mine.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.895
Well, now that you ask...

13:32.978 --> 13:35.064
I had a lovely day.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.399
- Oh?
- Yes.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.569
I... bought a new dress.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.904
Did you?

13:41.987 --> 13:43.864
Yeah.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.079
That the dress?

13:50.162 --> 13:52.122
It is.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.750
What do you think?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.919
It's nice.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.089
Just nice?

14:00.172 --> 14:01.966
It...

14:02.049 --> 14:03.968
cost a whole week's allowance.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.970
Why would you spend that much
on a dress?

14:06.053 --> 14:09.306
I wanted to look pretty.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.308
For you.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.935
Oh.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.770
Well...

14:14.853 --> 14:17.398
thanks.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.112
- What's wrong?
- I don't understand.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.573
It has been years
since I bought a new dress.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.450
And I got my nails done,
a-and I got a new hairdo.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.536
- How could you not notice?
- Oh.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.746
Well, to be honest,
I never notice stuff like that.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.749
- Why not?
- 'Cause when I look at you, I don't see

14:35.833 --> 14:37.126
clothes or hair.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.629
I just see you...
the girl I married.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.006
Is that so?

14:42.089 --> 14:43.757
Yeah. I don't expect you

14:43.841 --> 14:45.134
to be chic or stylish.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.635
You're my wife.

14:46.719 --> 14:50.222
I just need you
to be the... same old Beth.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.185
What the hell?

15:36.268 --> 15:38.312
If you're not going
to notice what I'm wearing,

15:38.395 --> 15:40.606
why should I bother
to wear anything at all?

15:42.566 --> 15:44.193
Honey.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.487
You want
to see the same old Beth?

15:46.570 --> 15:49.031
Fine. Here she is
in all her glory.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.825
Honey!

16:01.794 --> 16:03.712
Why is your boss here?

16:03.796 --> 16:07.216
He probably came
to get his briefcase.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.722
Could you give me a moment
before you open the door?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.433
Definitely.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.367
Simone!

16:38.163 --> 16:40.916
I would prefer
you call me Mrs. Grove.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.584
At least in public.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.754
You got it... Mrs. Grove.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.923
My mom asked me to bring
you these get-well muffins.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.426
- Oh, that was nice of her.
- Yeah, not really.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.553
She just wanted me to find out
what happened to Mr. Grove.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.722
- Well, you know what happened.
- And I'm not telling her.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.932
So I guess it's kind
of a waste of muffins.

16:57.015 --> 17:00.269
But I can still carry them in
the house for you if you'd like.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.937
No, thank you.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.820
Come on, Simone!

17:14.575 --> 17:16.285
Tommy, that kiss
we shared was sweet,

17:16.368 --> 17:18.120
but it was not a down payment.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.457
Look, if you don't find me
attractive, then just say so.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.959
I find you
alarmingly attractive,

17:24.042 --> 17:26.670
but there are
other considerations.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.130
Like what?

17:28.213 --> 17:29.798
Your mother is my best friend.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.967
- So?
- So it would be

17:32.050 --> 17:34.303
an absolute betrayal
to sleep with her child.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.763
I'm not a child.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.223
I've grown up, and I-I've
learned some things.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.143
Like... how to take care
of a woman's needs.

17:41.226 --> 17:45.773
Just give me a chance to show
you the man that I've become.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.942
That was a lovely speech, Tommy.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.861
Next time try it
without the skateboard.

17:56.074 --> 17:59.369
God. Isn't this magical?

18:01.371 --> 18:04.666
Well... it's certainly nice.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.002
Nice?!

18:07.086 --> 18:09.963
You have no idea the kinds
of places I grew up in.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.673
When I was a kid, I thought

18:11.757 --> 18:14.051
that houses like this
only existed on TV.

18:14.134 --> 18:17.346
You never talk
about your childhood.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.682
Yeah, yeah, that's
'cause it was shitty.

18:20.766 --> 18:24.228
It was just bouncing
between foster homes

18:24.311 --> 18:26.647
with parents who only saw me

18:26.730 --> 18:28.941
as another check
from the government.

18:31.819 --> 18:35.364
But you make me feel
like I'm worth something.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.574
So...

18:37.658 --> 18:39.701
yeah, that's really magical.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.704
I guess it is.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.206
Yeah, it is.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.666
Is it?

18:45.749 --> 18:47.167
Hey, guys.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.670
Ooh!

18:49.753 --> 18:51.046
Ooh, that's hot.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.881
Wow.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.716
- Eli...
- So funny.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.718
I was on my way to the bakery,
and I remembered

18:56.802 --> 18:58.637
we still have that pie
in the fridge.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.055
I'm so dumb.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.266
You're also naked. Why?

19:02.349 --> 19:03.934
Am I the only one?

19:04.017 --> 19:07.062
Oh, gosh, that's awkward.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.523
Well, of course, there are

19:09.606 --> 19:11.400
two ways to fix this situation.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.694
I could put on a suit, or...

19:13.777 --> 19:15.404
- Inside.
- What?

19:15.487 --> 19:16.864
Inside... now.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.615
Oh, there we go. Steady.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.950
Use my arm.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.452
It's very kind of you
to help me like this.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.871
Oh, here, sit.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.747
Oh. Oh, dear. Hang on.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.959
Oh. There we are.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.919
So, um...

19:31.003 --> 19:33.839
Shall we begin?

19:33.922 --> 19:36.592
- Begin what?
- The conversation.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.719
You-you must have
questions for me.

19:38.802 --> 19:42.097
When did I know I was gay?
How many men have I been with?

19:42.180 --> 19:44.308
Karl, please.
I just had lunch.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.101
You're not curious?

19:46.184 --> 19:47.769
Not in the slightest.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.938
And if this arrangement
is going to work,

19:50.022 --> 19:52.441
you can't bring up topics
that will upset me.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.942
But we need to talk about this

19:54.026 --> 19:55.485
if we're to have any sort
of rapprochement.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.487
- What do you mean?
- We've been married

19:57.571 --> 19:58.947
for ten years, Simone.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.824
You can't say
we haven't been happy.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.660
No, I can't.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.956
I'm glad you know the truth.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.292
Now we can deal with
it, come to some sort

20:10.375 --> 20:13.128
of understanding, and...

20:13.211 --> 20:15.589
maybe we could
be happy again?

20:16.882 --> 20:18.926
Darling, I'm not ready
to discuss this yet.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.637
I've moved your things
into the guest room.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.473
I don't want anyone to know that
we're staying in separate beds.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.266
Especially not my daughter.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.768
I understand.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.354
Where are you going?

20:30.437 --> 20:31.980
Oh, I-I felt
a little chilly.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.191
I wanted to get
my cashmere throw.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.109
Oh, well, I'll get it for you.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.486
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.237
Don't be silly.

20:40.238 --> 20:42.282
You're very kind, darling.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.264
You son of a bitch!

21:15.899 --> 21:17.985
All right, um,
if you'll just let me explain.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.528
- Shut up. I'm counting pills.
- Yes, I...

21:19.611 --> 21:22.072
I-I admit I may...
I may have dropped a few.

21:23.907 --> 21:26.076
There are over 40 pills here.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.703
You said you swallowed
the whole bottle.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.205
How many did you really take?
Two? Three?

21:30.288 --> 21:31.665
They pumped my stomach.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.041
I'm not paying for that.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.127
Not when a good burp
would have saved you.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.841
And where's your cane?

21:40.924 --> 21:42.884
Shit.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.220
Please understand.

21:45.303 --> 21:47.222
I was trying to
prove I love you.

21:47.305 --> 21:49.558
By faking a suicide attempt?

21:49.641 --> 21:51.768
You don't respond
to small gestures!

21:51.852 --> 21:53.437
I'm going to work out.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.397
If you and your things
are not out of this house

21:55.480 --> 21:57.524
by the time I get home,
I will call the police.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.067
Where am I supposed to go?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.277
I don't care!

22:00.360 --> 22:01.945
Well, maybe I'll go to Naomi's.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.741
Yes. Uh,
sh-she has a guest room.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.826
Maybe she'll ply me with liquor

22:07.909 --> 22:09.953
and get me
to spill all my lurid secrets.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.914
And why would you do that?

22:12.998 --> 22:15.167
You're the one
who kept your sex life hidden.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.710
I was married.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.670
If you kick me to the curb,

22:18.754 --> 22:20.922
- I'll have no reason
- <i>not</i> to come out.

22:21.006 --> 22:25.385
And then you, my love, will
be another Grace Belknap.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.930
Remember Grace?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.724
Are you threatening me?

22:30.807 --> 22:33.060
Yes, her husband ran off
with their carpenter, I believe.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.728
Oh, your friends were so catty.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.271
For God's sake, Karl...

22:36.354 --> 22:38.440
But you were the
cruelest of all, Simone.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.983
"Oh, poor Grace.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.486
"I suppose her carpenter
wasn't the only one

22:42.569 --> 22:44.279
with a stud finder."

22:44.362 --> 22:45.906
Oh, I imagine

22:45.989 --> 22:48.617
those women would relish
the poetic justice

22:48.700 --> 22:50.786
if you wound up
in the same boat.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.788
Why are you doing this?

22:52.871 --> 22:56.416
I am fighting
for our future happiness.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.460
By blackmailing me.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.921
Well, like I said...

23:01.004 --> 23:03.465
you don't respond
to small gestures.

23:11.264 --> 23:13.141
What do you think you're doing?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.476
What do you mean?

23:14.559 --> 23:15.936
You own swim trunks, Eli,
multiple pairs.

23:16.019 --> 23:18.480
So why did Jade and I
just get a face full of ass?

23:18.563 --> 23:20.273
- Well...
- I'll tell you why.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.609
You thought if you left Jade
and I alone to get comfortable,

23:22.692 --> 23:24.611
we'd get a little loose,
a little frisky,

23:24.694 --> 23:26.154
and then you
could just slide right in

23:26.238 --> 23:28.156
and the three of us
would fuck the night away.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.493
That may have been
on my wish list, yes.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.036
Solid plan.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.871
Not gonna happen.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.957
Okay. Okay.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.962
But what if it did?

23:42.045 --> 23:43.463
I mean, think about it.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.965
We like sex with each other.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.508
We like sex
with hot women.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.968
It's one of the reasons
we work as a couple.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.386
We've got so much in common.

23:49.469 --> 23:50.637
That's fine for us.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.013
- But what about Jade?
- Oh, I'm...

23:52.097 --> 23:53.014
I'm pretty sure
she's into me.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.182
What? Why?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.684
The other day,
she was going on and on

23:55.767 --> 23:57.394
about how much
she liked my movie.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.436
I liked <i>The Shining.</i>

23:58.520 --> 24:00.939
That doesn't mean
I want to fuck Stephen King.

24:01.022 --> 24:03.358
Okay, all right.
Well, well, if you're not sure

24:03.442 --> 24:05.193
that she'd be into it,

24:05.277 --> 24:07.070
ask her.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.698
No, it'd be weird.

24:09.781 --> 24:10.907
Weird how?

24:10.991 --> 24:12.367
Like, I don't know

24:12.450 --> 24:14.703
if she's that adventurous.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.205
She fucked you
in a fitting room!

24:17.289 --> 24:20.000
Okay.
It would be weird for <i>us.</i>

24:20.083 --> 24:21.877
We've never done anything
like this before.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.212
No, it doesn't have
to be a big deal.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.381
No, we-we've already
got an open marriage.

24:26.464 --> 24:29.426
Why can't it be open to Jade?

24:32.137 --> 24:33.847
Fine.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.057
I'll ask her for a three-way.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.851
Will that shut you up?

24:37.934 --> 24:40.562
I think you know it will.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.189
Okay, but we won't pressure her.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.148
No. No, no.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.900
I will take her aside,
I will ask respectfully,

24:44.983 --> 24:46.276
- and if she says no...
- Mm-hmm.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.862
She says yes.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.244
You two coming or what?

25:07.547 --> 25:09.883
His boss saw your tits?

25:09.966 --> 25:11.760
Don't make it sound
worse than it was.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.428
I'm not sure I could.

25:13.511 --> 25:14.930
I was so angry.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.473
I changed my whole look.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.266
Rob did not even notice.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.227
Here's my two cents,
all right?

25:20.310 --> 25:21.603
Spend them wisely.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.772
Rob isn't cheating on you
because you don't wear

25:23.855 --> 25:25.607
the latest styles from Paris.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.067
What do you mean?

25:27.150 --> 25:29.236
Ma! Mikey hit me.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.278
What am I, your bodyguard?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.696
Hit him back.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.450
So what I mean is,

25:35.533 --> 25:37.744
how is your love life?

25:37.827 --> 25:40.080
Are you doing everything
you can to keep him interested?

25:40.163 --> 25:41.248
Sheila.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.833
Sometimes old dogs
need new tricks.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.502
New tricks?

25:45.585 --> 25:48.004
I was a virgin
on my wedding night.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.049
I only know what Rob
was willing to teach me.

25:52.509 --> 25:55.762
There's a book
that you should read.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.474
What is this?

25:59.557 --> 26:00.642
It's a manual.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.686
For married couples.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.439
These are dirty pictures!

26:06.523 --> 26:07.774
They're illustrations.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.567
They're scientific.

26:10.568 --> 26:11.987
Why do you have this?

26:12.070 --> 26:14.990
There was a time
that Leo and I felt

26:15.073 --> 26:18.285
<i>our</i> love life needed
a little zing.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.161
And you actually do
these things?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.372
You see page 76?

26:23.415 --> 26:24.499
Yes.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.293
That's how we got Benny.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.379
Oh, dear.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.840
Yeah. That's not
for beginners.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.216
Let's go back a few chapters.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.052
Ah. That's a classic.

26:36.136 --> 26:39.055
We like to do that
in the shower.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.890
You've done that to Leo?

26:40.974 --> 26:41.891
That's...

26:41.975 --> 26:44.019
how I got my Pontiac.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.689
And you really think
Rob will like these things?

26:48.732 --> 26:50.025
I do.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.192
And...

26:51.276 --> 26:54.029
I won't feel humiliated after?

26:54.112 --> 26:57.866
Sex is how women
gain power over men.

26:57.949 --> 27:01.745
And there is nothing
humiliating about that.

27:05.790 --> 27:06.708
Jumping jacks!

27:06.791 --> 27:09.085
Two, three, four,

27:09.169 --> 27:12.213
five, six,
seven, eight...

27:12.297 --> 27:16.051
Simone, I've never seen you
work out so fiercely.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.887
I began to wonder if maybe
you're upset about something.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.388
Not at all.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.849
Just burning off
the muffins you sent.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.059
So, Karl's home?

27:24.142 --> 27:26.019
Yes.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.356
And everything's fine?

27:29.439 --> 27:31.232
Yes.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.026
Why do you ask?

27:33.109 --> 27:34.235
It's just...

27:34.319 --> 27:37.906
Wanda left the most cryptic
message on my answering machine.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.075
Before she left for rehab.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.243
She intimated that you
and Karl were having

27:42.327 --> 27:44.412
some sort
of marital problems.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.123
Oh, we're fine, Naomi.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.625
Now, if you'll excuse me.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.294
Simone, please.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.837
You don't have to pretend.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.422
Not with me.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.091
I wasn't surprised.

27:56.174 --> 27:59.761
I've known for some time
about Karl's indiscretions.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.639
I don't know
what you've heard...

28:02.722 --> 28:03.807
I didn't hear.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.768
I saw with my own eyes.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.729
What exactly did you see?

28:09.813 --> 28:12.440
I-I was picking up
my dry cleaning one day,

28:12.524 --> 28:13.400
and there was his car,

28:13.483 --> 28:16.903
parked across the street
at some seedy motel.

28:21.699 --> 28:24.077
So you know everything.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.662
I do.

28:25.745 --> 28:29.416
I mean, I couldn't tell you
who the woman was, but...

28:30.417 --> 28:33.002
The woman?

28:33.086 --> 28:34.379
I wanted to catch him
in the act,

28:34.462 --> 28:35.964
but I couldn't just stand there
all day,

28:36.047 --> 28:38.675
waiting for him
and his floozy to come out.

28:38.758 --> 28:42.137
So you have no idea
who he was with?

28:42.220 --> 28:43.847
No.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.269
Do you?

28:49.352 --> 28:51.312
Oh, Naomi.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.606
I really do have to go.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.526
The important thing is,

28:56.609 --> 28:59.904
is that you finally know
the truth.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.281
"Finally"?

29:03.032 --> 29:05.160
How long ago did this happen?

29:05.243 --> 29:06.494
I don't know.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.620
Year ago.

29:07.704 --> 29:08.997
Maybe two.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.500
You knew my husband
was cheating for two years

29:12.584 --> 29:14.043
and you said nothing?

29:14.127 --> 29:15.503
Wives always say
they'd want to know

29:15.587 --> 29:16.588
if their husbands were cheating,

29:16.671 --> 29:19.215
but they never forgive
the person who tells them.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.967
But you're my best friend.

29:21.050 --> 29:23.470
And you're... one of mine.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.765
I'm so glad we had this talk.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.609
You still want
to make love to me?

29:37.692 --> 29:39.319
Yeah.

29:39.402 --> 29:40.653
I'm free today at 4:00.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.696
Great.

29:41.779 --> 29:43.198
Where should we go?

29:43.281 --> 29:45.366
You're a man now.
Figure it out.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.421
Hi there.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.048
You're home early.

30:00.131 --> 30:00.965
I have a business dinner.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.051
I wanted to come home
and shower first.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.553
Another business dinner.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.223
You've had
a lot of those lately.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.266
Sorry, honey.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.393
Duty calls.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.523
Oh, before we get in there,
got any Jade tips for me?

30:16.606 --> 30:17.982
You know, dos and don'ts?

30:18.066 --> 30:19.108
Stuff she likes,
stuff she doesn't.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.735
Oh. You know
that thing you do to me?

30:20.818 --> 30:22.070
- With your tongue?
- The circle thing.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.071
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.239
Don't do that.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.698
You don't think she'd like that?

30:25.782 --> 30:26.699
- No.
- Why not?

30:26.783 --> 30:28.243
Because I've never liked it.

30:28.326 --> 30:31.079
Copy that. Good tip.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.545
Honey, what are you doing?

31:21.546 --> 31:23.464
What is this?

31:23.548 --> 31:27.302
I want to try something
I read in a book.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.430
I think you'll like it.

31:30.513 --> 31:31.806
Beth Ann...

31:31.889 --> 31:32.932
Shh.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.602
I have to concentrate.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.159
- Hold still.
- Beth Ann.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.329
Oh, my God.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.997
Oh,
my God.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.750
Oh, my God.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.961
Seriously, honey,
that kind of hurts.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.338
I'll go slower.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.340
You really don't have to...

32:05.423 --> 32:07.425
Ow. Ow, ow, ow!

32:15.141 --> 32:17.018
Oh, dear.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.895
Oh!

32:18.978 --> 32:20.897
Oh.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.857
Oh, my God.

32:22.940 --> 32:24.692
I can't believe
that just happened.

32:24.776 --> 32:25.777
Well, it did.

32:27.153 --> 32:29.781
Wow.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.700
I must have done something...

32:32.784 --> 32:34.577
really good in a past life.

32:34.661 --> 32:35.703
Like...

32:35.787 --> 32:38.247
like maybe I was Jesus or...

32:38.331 --> 32:39.874
or that guy that cured polio.

32:39.957 --> 32:41.209
What was his name?

32:41.292 --> 32:43.169
Oh.

32:43.252 --> 32:44.545
Yeah.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.340
Yeah, that's right.

32:47.423 --> 32:50.593
Yeah, it's all
about you guys now.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.887
So what can I do to help?

32:54.180 --> 32:56.641
I'm open to
suggestion.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.061
Hello?

33:00.144 --> 33:01.729
- Hey, babe, can you just give us a minute?
- Yeah?

33:01.813 --> 33:03.856
Yeah, we're both
very, very close.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.025
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sure.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.527
I'm hungry.

33:07.610 --> 33:08.903
You guys hungry?

33:08.986 --> 33:09.946
Whew.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.241
I'm gonna get some pie.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.785
Whew. Yeah.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.313
Simone.

35:09.398 --> 35:10.817
Hello, Tommy.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.568
You look nice.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.986
Thank you.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.325
I have the catering van
all afternoon.

35:19.408 --> 35:21.160
Oh, clever idea
switching cars.

35:21.244 --> 35:22.662
Where are we going?

35:22.745 --> 35:24.205
What do you mean,
"Where are we going?"

35:24.288 --> 35:25.623
We're here.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.713
You can't be serious.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.424
You want to make love
to me in a catering van?

35:35.508 --> 35:37.593
The futon is brand-new,
and so are the sheets.

35:37.677 --> 35:40.388
Well, technically,
they're tablecloths.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.515
There's no way I'm getting
into your mobile sex den.

35:44.892 --> 35:45.893
For God's sake.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.061
Then come inside.

35:47.144 --> 35:48.187
Come on.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.481
Oh!

35:54.443 --> 35:57.947
So... what do you think?

35:58.030 --> 35:59.574
You like the candle?

35:59.657 --> 36:01.117
It's sandalwood.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.411
All I can smell
is pastrami.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.872
Oh, yeah. We catered
a bris yesterday.

36:05.955 --> 36:06.914
I can't do this.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.624
Wait.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.462
I even got us music.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.257
I don't care if you hired
the Budapest String Quartet.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.551
I'm not fucking you in a van.

36:18.634 --> 36:20.428
Look, I know you were probably
hoping for a nice hotel,

36:20.511 --> 36:22.471
but I can't afford that.
I'm sorry.

36:22.555 --> 36:26.267
Don't be. I needed to remember
this is a bad idea. Thank you.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.144
Wait-wait.
So y-you're just leaving?

36:28.227 --> 36:29.896
You've always been a good kid.

36:29.979 --> 36:32.231
And you're becoming
a good... friend,

36:32.315 --> 36:35.067
but let's not let a silly
impulse ruin that, okay?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.410
Okay.

36:44.493 --> 36:45.620
Goodbye.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.455
Goodbye.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.677
What will you tell
the doctor?

37:01.761 --> 37:03.137
The truth.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.764
I was cut to shreds

37:04.847 --> 37:07.099
moments after my wife
turned into a French whore.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.976
There's no need to be rude.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.812
Well, I'll be more pleasant once
I've stopped bleeding profusely.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.940
For God's sake.
What were you thinking?

37:14.023 --> 37:15.066
I wanted to surprise you.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.485
Well, next time bake a cake.

37:17.568 --> 37:21.864
- I got the idea from...
- a sex manual.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.658
It said men like
that sort of thing.

37:23.741 --> 37:27.662
Well, men on shore leave,
perhaps. Not me.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.413
Well, I had to do something.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.748
Why?

37:32.416 --> 37:34.251
I feel you pulling away from me.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.463
That's not true.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.715
- It is. It absolutely is.
- Nah.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.385
- It's work. I've been preoccupied.
- No.

37:42.468 --> 37:45.012
It's more than that.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.473
You're unhappy.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.687
I see it.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.481
Every day.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.901
You get up,
you go to work,

37:58.985 --> 38:01.696
you come home,
you eat dinner,

38:01.779 --> 38:04.198
you put on a smile
for my benefit,

38:04.281 --> 38:06.242
and then you go to sleep.

38:06.325 --> 38:09.370
That's what your life is.

38:09.453 --> 38:12.248
And it's empty.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.419
Because of what
we've suffered.

38:16.502 --> 38:19.338
Please don't talk about that.

38:24.301 --> 38:26.512
We've tried
not talking about it,

38:26.595 --> 38:29.098
and it doesn't help.

38:29.181 --> 38:34.061
You're drowning in the routine
of your existence.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.776
I know because I'm drowning
alongside you.

38:44.655 --> 38:49.243
But maybe if
we help each other...

38:49.326 --> 38:52.621
we can survive.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.382
I wish I was a better man.

39:03.466 --> 39:06.260
You are a fine man.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.888
I've made choices...

39:08.971 --> 39:10.556
I'm not proud of.

39:10.639 --> 39:13.601
Like what?

39:17.730 --> 39:19.565
Mr. Stanton?

39:19.648 --> 39:22.610
The doctor
will see you now.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.862
Oh. Okay.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.116
I'll be back soon.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.284
Rob.

39:30.367 --> 39:32.411
I'm glad we had
this little talk.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.622
I feel better.

39:43.172 --> 39:45.466
That was fun, huh?

39:45.549 --> 39:48.844
I mean, I knew sex was cool,
because I'm not a virgin,

39:48.928 --> 39:50.846
but my limited experience

39:50.930 --> 39:52.515
with the girls
on the drill team

39:52.598 --> 39:55.518
did not prepare me for that.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.147
Simone?

40:00.231 --> 40:03.442
Hey, are you okay?

40:03.526 --> 40:04.985
Yes.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.821
Are you sure?
Because y-you seem upset.

40:06.904 --> 40:09.365
No.

40:09.448 --> 40:13.494
I now realize
what I've been missing for...

40:13.577 --> 40:15.621
God, such a very long time.

40:15.704 --> 40:18.999
So you and Mr. Grove never...?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.960
Not for years.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.212
I told myself it's marriage.
Passion fades.

40:23.295 --> 40:25.172
That's what happens
when you get old.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.841
You're not old.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.634
You're a goddess.

40:28.717 --> 40:31.887
Well, the temple's been closed
for quite some time.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.639
But thank you.

40:33.722 --> 40:37.810
For reminding me
that I'm still alive.

40:37.893 --> 40:39.812
You want to do it again?

40:39.895 --> 40:42.523
Yes. What day's good for you?

40:42.606 --> 40:43.691
No, I meant now.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.192
Now?

40:45.276 --> 40:47.194
You can go again already?

40:50.239 --> 40:53.826
Ah, youth.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.873
Eli?

41:00.833 --> 41:02.877
In here.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.381
I got to hand it to you, babe.

41:07.464 --> 41:10.342
That was some kind of fun.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.219
Oh, I'm so glad
we went there.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.722
It was absolutely...

41:14.805 --> 41:16.765
Wow.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.518
Yeah.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.730
That's it?

41:22.813 --> 41:25.524
Hey, you don't get a lot of
I-told-you-sos with me, babe.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.985
Don't waste this one.

41:30.404 --> 41:31.739
What's wrong?

41:31.822 --> 41:33.699
Nothing.

41:33.782 --> 41:35.743
Are you sulking?

41:35.826 --> 41:37.411
- No.
- Then what's up?

41:37.494 --> 41:39.079
'Cause you don't look
like a man who just had

41:39.163 --> 41:40.581
his lifelong dream fulfilled.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.416
I need to ask you something.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.542
Okay.

41:44.793 --> 41:46.962
You in love with her?

41:52.092 --> 41:53.302
I knew it.

41:53.385 --> 41:55.262
Six months.

41:55.346 --> 41:58.891
That... should have been
my first clue.

41:58.974 --> 42:01.602
I think you're jumping
to conclusions here.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.145
I saw the way
that you looked at her.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.897
When?

42:04.980 --> 42:06.232
I was there in the doorway.

42:06.315 --> 42:08.400
You two were holding
each other and...

42:08.484 --> 42:12.529
I can't remember the last time
you looked at me like that.

42:18.077 --> 42:20.120
Honey.

42:21.538 --> 42:23.123
This isn't about me.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.125
This is about you.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.169
Don't do that.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.797
You've been insecure lately
because of your career.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.840
Are you in love with her?

42:33.384 --> 42:34.551
No.

42:37.012 --> 42:40.557
Really? Because... that look.

42:42.184 --> 42:43.644
Look, I'll admit,

42:43.727 --> 42:46.105
she's more
than just another hookup.

42:46.188 --> 42:48.774
And I should have told you
about her a long time ago.

42:48.857 --> 42:51.443
But my love story...

42:51.527 --> 42:54.613
is with you.

42:54.697 --> 42:57.074
And it always will be.

42:58.576 --> 42:59.868
Okay?

43:02.121 --> 43:06.834
I guess I have been feeling
a little insecure lately.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.794
Yeah.

43:08.877 --> 43:11.005
And when you guys
didn't come downstairs...

43:11.088 --> 43:13.007
I'm sorry about that.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.341
Truly.

43:15.884 --> 43:18.345
Are we good?

43:22.433 --> 43:23.934
Yeah, we're good.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.314
Hey.

43:28.397 --> 43:30.149
I thought we were having pie.

43:30.232 --> 43:32.735
Yes, we are.
We are.

43:32.818 --> 43:34.028
Great.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.404
Just don't expect
ice cream.

43:35.487 --> 43:36.947
Unless you guys
like it drinkable.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.210
Oh, hello.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.379
- Where have you been?
- You committed adultery, Karl.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.214
That means you're
no longer entitled

43:54.298 --> 43:56.050
to keep tabs on my life.

43:56.133 --> 43:57.885
Eh, fair enough.

43:57.968 --> 43:59.428
Did you go to the gym?

43:59.511 --> 44:01.722
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

44:01.805 --> 44:04.266
You seem, uh, energized.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.393
Do I?

44:06.477 --> 44:09.063
Yes. Have you embarked
on a new exercise regimen?

44:09.146 --> 44:12.566
As a matter of fact, I have.

44:12.649 --> 44:17.154
And I plan on working out
as often as I can.

44:31.043 --> 44:33.629
Well, I should get going.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.256
Going?

44:36.340 --> 44:39.134
To my dinner meeting.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.345
You've just gotten back
from the hospital.

44:41.428 --> 44:42.930
I feel fine.

44:43.013 --> 44:46.433
Surely whomever you're
meeting with has already left.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.894
I called the restaurant.

44:48.977 --> 44:51.355
They're still there.

44:55.859 --> 44:57.653
Oh.

44:59.029 --> 45:01.031
Rob, please don't go.

45:01.115 --> 45:02.282
Honey.

45:02.366 --> 45:05.953
This has been
an awkward night.

45:06.036 --> 45:09.998
I really do think you and I
need some time together.

45:13.585 --> 45:15.546
I need to make an appearance.

45:15.629 --> 45:19.299
They must be important clients.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.635
Very important.

45:21.718 --> 45:23.887
Don't wait up.
