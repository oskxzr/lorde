Previously on Why Women Kill...

00:10.009 --> 00:11.117
I have a date.

00:11.142 --> 00:12.351
With your married man.

00:12.376 --> 00:14.279
It's at this really fancy nightclub.

00:14.304 --> 00:15.711
He's taking you out.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.037
In public.

00:18.062 --> 00:19.908
I thought Rob was taking
her to the club tonight.

00:19.932 --> 00:22.140
Do you honestly think I'm
going to let that happen?

00:22.165 --> 00:23.649
Listen, when you were
in my office earlier,

00:23.673 --> 00:25.826
did you happen to move any papers?

00:25.851 --> 00:27.828
I know better than to touch your things.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.773
I'll have to stay late and redo it.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.266
<i>Would you like to come
with me to the club tonight?</i>

00:33.290 --> 00:34.506
Rob canceled on me.

00:34.531 --> 00:35.687
I love music.

00:35.712 --> 00:37.975
- I used to play the piano.
- Do you still play?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.754
My husband...
didn't care for my playing.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.170
Oh, honey. Your husband's dead.

00:43.195 --> 00:45.414
Don't you think it's time
you stopped listening to him?

00:47.771 --> 00:48.960
Honey!

00:48.985 --> 00:51.150
Maybe when Mr. Grove moves out,

00:51.175 --> 00:52.517
we could start doing this in your bed.

00:52.541 --> 00:55.087
He won't be leaving
until after my daughter's wedding.

00:55.112 --> 00:57.071
Well, it... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:57.096 --> 00:58.392
That's two months away.

00:58.417 --> 01:00.844
She gave me her hand in marriage.

01:00.869 --> 01:03.736
- Karl...
- And I'm never going to let it go.

01:04.354 --> 01:06.321
Oh! Bloody hell!

01:06.346 --> 01:07.416
I got fired.

01:07.441 --> 01:08.447
I'm not surprised.

01:08.472 --> 01:10.556
- Simone...
- One day, I will divorce Karl,

01:10.581 --> 01:12.009
but I will never hate him.

01:12.034 --> 01:13.291
Where does that leave me?

01:13.316 --> 01:14.736
In the back of a van,

01:14.761 --> 01:16.110
having a marvelous time.

01:16.135 --> 01:17.830
Van came with the job, so...

01:17.855 --> 01:19.291
We'll figure it out.

01:19.316 --> 01:21.143
I'm not worried about Duke anymore.

01:21.492 --> 01:22.712
He stopped texting me.

01:22.737 --> 01:23.814
So what's his deal?

01:23.839 --> 01:25.087
- Is he crazy?
- A little.

01:25.112 --> 01:27.126
He was always accusing
me of cheating on him.

01:27.151 --> 01:28.541
Come with us to Venice tomorrow.

01:28.566 --> 01:31.376
- Oh, my God!
- Tomorrow? Really?

01:31.401 --> 01:32.603
Are you going to Venice?

01:32.628 --> 01:34.349
I don't know yet.

01:34.374 --> 01:36.437
I asked you, before,
if you were in love with her.

01:36.461 --> 01:39.608
Jade is the only thing
in my life that is easy.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.878
Live with us.

01:40.903 --> 01:41.983
Be with us.

01:42.008 --> 01:43.826
You just got home.

02:57.927 --> 03:01.501
The purpose of an autopsy
is to provide clarity.

03:02.457 --> 03:04.415
How did the victim die?

03:05.204 --> 03:08.533
Was death the result of a gunshot?

03:10.267 --> 03:11.746
Stabbing?

03:14.859 --> 03:16.017
Poison?

03:17.152 --> 03:19.822
How someone is killed
is easy to understand.

03:19.847 --> 03:23.618
Why it happened, that's never so simple.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.298
But it always begins with a choice.

03:29.123 --> 03:31.322
It might be a decision

03:31.347 --> 03:33.806
to conduct a tawdry affair.

03:34.981 --> 03:38.470
A plan to keep secrets from a loved one.

03:40.121 --> 03:42.009
Or an agreement

03:42.034 --> 03:45.603
to bring a stranger into your bed.

03:47.023 --> 03:51.854
Yes. People make all sorts
of questionable choices.

03:52.141 --> 03:55.340
Of course,
that's what keeps me in business.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.161
Our waitress is giving me odd looks.

04:06.186 --> 04:09.168
You're wearing sunglasses
indoors, at night.

04:09.193 --> 04:10.911
I think she recognizes me.

04:10.936 --> 04:13.971
I don't even recognize you
and we've had sex ten times.

04:13.996 --> 04:15.698
- Lower your voice.
- Relax.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.535
Nobody here recognizes you.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.890
Let me see your eyes.

04:24.597 --> 04:28.041
So, I got you a present.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.765
Jewelry?

04:30.790 --> 04:32.284
You shouldn't have.

04:37.639 --> 04:38.901
It's called a Swatch.

04:39.756 --> 04:41.995
And... it's waterproof.

04:42.265 --> 04:45.151
Oh, so it's safe from my tears of joy.

04:46.289 --> 04:48.260
I wanted to do something special.

04:48.614 --> 04:49.920
It's our first date.

04:49.945 --> 04:52.862
I mean, outside of the van.

04:52.887 --> 04:54.909
I'm not sure I'd call it a date.

04:54.934 --> 04:55.934
Why not?

04:55.959 --> 04:58.471
We're at a table, and there's food.

05:00.505 --> 05:02.721
I wouldn't call it food, either.

05:03.162 --> 05:05.237
You don't make it very
easy to be your boyfriend.

05:05.262 --> 05:06.307
Boyfriend?

05:06.332 --> 05:08.105
Ah, another word you don't like.

05:09.162 --> 05:11.541
It's just not how I would describe you.

05:12.311 --> 05:13.721
What would you call me, then?

05:14.040 --> 05:16.448
Your... lover?

05:16.473 --> 05:20.621
Why do you need a job title?
What's wrong with "Tommy"?

05:21.674 --> 05:23.402
Are you gonna put it on?

05:25.373 --> 05:27.386
Why would I do that?

05:27.411 --> 05:29.949
Because it's a gift,
and I'm asking you to.

05:29.974 --> 05:31.497
Oh, for God's sake.

05:32.505 --> 05:33.785
What's wrong?

05:33.810 --> 05:35.363
Am I embarrassing you?

05:35.388 --> 05:37.019
Shh. Shush. Sit down.

05:37.044 --> 05:38.855
Oh, I'm sorry.
Next time, I'll buy you a gift

05:38.880 --> 05:40.752
that you'll actually
wear on a date with me,

05:40.777 --> 05:42.496
like a ski mask.

05:43.142 --> 05:44.433
Tommy.

05:44.458 --> 05:46.425
Uh, what did I do now?

05:51.007 --> 05:52.667
Can I get you anything else to eat?

05:53.491 --> 05:56.089
Oh, God, no. The food is dreadful here.

05:56.707 --> 05:58.246
And he's too young for you,

05:58.271 --> 06:00.441
while we're offering
unsolicited opinions.

06:15.091 --> 06:16.941
Sheila. What can I do for you?

06:16.966 --> 06:18.577
I have no food in my house,

06:18.602 --> 06:21.285
and my kids are starting to
make some real ugly threats.

06:21.310 --> 06:23.011
Maybe I can find a jar of peanut butter.

06:23.036 --> 06:24.941
That's more than they deserve.

06:27.744 --> 06:29.246
What's with the skates?

06:29.271 --> 06:30.425
They're cute, huh?

06:30.450 --> 06:32.325
Rob bought them for me
on our first date.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.005
He took me to Happytime Roller Rink.

06:34.030 --> 06:35.420
So why are you digging them up now?

06:35.444 --> 06:38.404
I'm going skating later
today, with April.

06:38.694 --> 06:40.833
- The waitress?
- Oh, yes.

06:40.858 --> 06:43.339
Last week, we went to
an Andy Warhol exhibit.

06:43.364 --> 06:45.380
Next week,
she's going to teach me to surf.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.122
Can you imagine? Me, surfing?

06:48.523 --> 06:50.848
I thought the plan was
to gain the girl's trust

06:50.873 --> 06:52.911
and convince her to end the affair.

06:53.290 --> 06:54.901
That's what I'm doing.

06:54.926 --> 06:56.059
You sure?

06:56.084 --> 06:58.485
'Cause it sounds like
the two of you are becoming close.

06:58.510 --> 07:00.298
Well, maybe a little.

07:00.998 --> 07:03.032
April is very sweet.

07:03.057 --> 07:05.015
She's so free-spirited.

07:05.375 --> 07:07.423
You wouldn't believe
the fun we have together.

07:07.448 --> 07:09.579
Mm-hmm. She sounds nice.

07:09.604 --> 07:11.955
For a girl who's sleeping
with your husband.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.678
I know it's odd, but I like her.

07:13.703 --> 07:15.055
I can't help it.

07:15.475 --> 07:17.782
What's wrong with her being a friend?

07:18.513 --> 07:19.860
Nothing.

07:20.078 --> 07:23.081
As long as you don't forget
she's also the enemy.

07:28.011 --> 07:30.540
Okay. Well, how about, uh, you know,

07:30.565 --> 07:32.891
classic "she's our lover"?

07:32.916 --> 07:35.157
Oof. That is too sexual.

07:35.182 --> 07:39.032
Yeah? All right.
Um, our "special friend"?

07:39.596 --> 07:41.415
That makes me sound slow.

07:43.329 --> 07:47.227
All right. Uh,
she's the third prong of our throuple.

07:47.252 --> 07:49.165
Ugh. Barf.

07:49.190 --> 07:50.790
Well, now that Jade's
gonna live with us,

07:50.815 --> 07:52.455
we got to have some
way to introduce her.

07:54.496 --> 07:56.907
Well, why don't we
just say she's family?

07:57.273 --> 08:00.001
- Aww. I love that.
- Yeah.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.743
That's nice.

08:04.365 --> 08:05.423
Wait.

08:05.448 --> 08:07.516
Jade, does that look like
Duke's truck to you?

08:07.910 --> 08:09.688
Oh, shit.

08:10.268 --> 08:13.469
Wait, like, like, scary ex Duke?

08:14.225 --> 08:15.588
Did you tell him you were staying here?

08:15.612 --> 08:17.493
No. I didn't tell anyone.

08:18.591 --> 08:19.993
Oh, God. He's getting out the car.

08:20.018 --> 08:21.486
- Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...
- Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

08:21.510 --> 08:22.728
Okay, all right, all right. Look.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.040
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

08:24.065 --> 08:26.493
- I got this.
- Wait, what do you mean, you got this?

08:26.518 --> 08:27.813
I'm gonna talk to him. You know?

08:27.838 --> 08:30.407
- Man to man.
- No. Eli... No... don't... E...

08:30.805 --> 08:32.610
Oh, that's not good. Okay.

08:34.033 --> 08:35.055
Can I help you?

08:35.080 --> 08:36.680
Yeah, I'm looking for my girlfriend.

08:36.705 --> 08:38.213
A guy told me that she's staying here.

08:38.237 --> 08:40.485
Oh. Uh, who's your girlfriend?

08:40.510 --> 08:41.525
Jade.

08:41.762 --> 08:43.032
Jade.

08:43.057 --> 08:45.087
Jade, Jade, Jade, Jade,
Jade, Jade, Jade...

08:45.112 --> 08:47.305
- No... Jade who?
- She's in that window, man.

08:49.822 --> 08:51.798
- Oh, Jade. Right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.822
- I need to talk to her.
- Oh, okay. Well, uh, the thing is,

08:53.846 --> 08:55.065
she's not really
available right now, so...

08:55.089 --> 08:56.385
- Yeah, I think she is.
- Yep.

08:57.190 --> 08:59.105
Oh, shit.

08:59.130 --> 09:00.618
All right, look... look, man.

09:00.643 --> 09:02.532
I don't want to get
physical with you, okay?

09:02.557 --> 09:04.329
You're right. You don't.

09:05.816 --> 09:07.579
What do you think you're doing?

09:08.366 --> 09:10.055
You must be the fuck buddy.

09:10.290 --> 09:13.337
And you must be Duke,
the two-time felon.

09:13.505 --> 09:15.508
Those were both felonies, right?

09:15.533 --> 09:17.555
So if I were to call the
cops and they came here

09:17.580 --> 09:20.118
to see you committing a third assault,

09:20.228 --> 09:22.360
that sounds like three strikes to me.

09:24.267 --> 09:27.649
This is the part where you walk
away to avoid going to prison.

09:29.774 --> 09:31.423
Tell Jade I'll be in touch.

09:38.591 --> 09:40.477
You know, that was unnecessary.

09:40.502 --> 09:41.923
I had it under control.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.173
- Honey, it was a team effort.
- I know.

09:45.198 --> 09:46.626
Thank you so much.

09:46.651 --> 09:48.243
I was so freaked out.

09:48.268 --> 09:50.196
Aww. Oh...

09:51.095 --> 09:52.399
You're my hero.

09:52.424 --> 09:53.696
Jade, I'm not your hero.

09:53.728 --> 09:56.337
I just, I'm... want
to make sure you're okay.

10:03.957 --> 10:06.704
Ooh, we should invite the
Prescotts to the wedding.

10:06.729 --> 10:07.852
Must we?

10:07.877 --> 10:09.174
Well, I can't stand them, either,

10:09.198 --> 10:11.524
but they spent $10,000
at the gallery last year.

10:11.549 --> 10:13.438
Just put them on the maybe list.

10:13.463 --> 10:16.165
Another maybe?
Amy will be here in an hour.

10:16.190 --> 10:18.079
We promised we'd have
the guest list done.

10:18.508 --> 10:21.188
What about the... Randalls?

10:21.213 --> 10:23.171
Absolutely not. I despise them.

10:23.196 --> 10:24.407
Since when?

10:24.432 --> 10:26.469
We went to their son's
wedding a month ago.

10:26.494 --> 10:28.782
And never got a thank you
note for the candy dish.

10:28.807 --> 10:30.361
- That's awfully petty.
- I agree.

10:30.385 --> 10:32.415
How hard is it to write a simple note?

10:32.440 --> 10:34.355
I meant you.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.899
What is going on?

10:35.924 --> 10:37.446
What do you mean, "going on"?

10:37.471 --> 10:40.996
You've been in a foul mood ever
since you came home last night.

10:41.629 --> 10:43.813
What could it be?

10:44.110 --> 10:47.055
I broke a nail? No, that's not it.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.641
My husband sleeps with men?
No, couldn't be that.

10:49.666 --> 10:51.649
Fine. Don't tell me.

10:51.674 --> 10:55.266
Look, we have prepaid
the caterer for 400 guests.

10:55.291 --> 10:56.712
If we don't finish our list,

10:56.737 --> 11:00.079
then Brad's family will invite
more rubes from Oklahoma,

11:00.104 --> 11:02.798
and the entire wedding
will turn into a hoedown.

11:03.310 --> 11:05.180
Do they have hoedowns in Oklahoma?

11:05.205 --> 11:06.684
Oh, well, they do in the musical.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.015
First number of act two.

11:09.024 --> 11:11.446
How did I not know what
I was getting with you?

11:11.471 --> 11:12.471
What?

11:14.617 --> 11:16.274
Oh, Amy, you're early.

11:16.299 --> 11:18.680
We haven't quite finished
the guest list yet.

11:19.370 --> 11:21.305
Brad slept with his ex-girlfriend.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.805
The wedding's off. I require wine.

11:30.744 --> 11:32.125
Watch out, watch ou... watch out!

11:45.620 --> 11:47.594
That was a blast.

11:48.004 --> 11:51.964
Can I just say,
every day I spend with you

11:51.989 --> 11:53.633
feels like an adventure.

11:54.072 --> 11:56.188
We do have fun together, don't we?

11:56.607 --> 11:58.126
To be honest,

11:58.151 --> 12:00.501
I've been feeling a
little lonely in L.A.

12:01.330 --> 12:02.837
I know how you feel.

12:04.104 --> 12:06.438
It's nice to have
a real girlfriend out here.

12:09.332 --> 12:12.665
Well, it's getting late. I should go.

12:13.020 --> 12:16.180
Wait, do you think you have time
for one more adventure tonight?

12:17.005 --> 12:18.473
- I suppose.
- Okay.

12:20.062 --> 12:21.454
April?

12:21.479 --> 12:23.090
What are you up to?

12:27.394 --> 12:29.766
Go ahead. Try one.

12:30.187 --> 12:32.610
Brownies? How are they an adventure?

12:32.635 --> 12:35.235
My recipe calls for
a special ingredient.

12:35.577 --> 12:36.782
Like what?

12:36.971 --> 12:38.251
Grass.

12:39.038 --> 12:40.290
From your lawn?

12:40.802 --> 12:43.594
No, I'm talking about pot.

12:43.794 --> 12:46.149
You know, marijuana?

12:47.533 --> 12:49.094
You mean reefer?

12:50.373 --> 12:52.079
Oh. Look, it's not a big deal.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.235
Lots of people do it.

12:53.260 --> 12:55.360
Criminals. Musicians.

12:55.385 --> 12:57.112
- Please don't be angry.
- You are a good girl.

12:57.136 --> 12:58.611
How could you do such a thing?

12:58.636 --> 13:00.220
Rob wanted to.

13:04.561 --> 13:05.962
Your married man?

13:05.987 --> 13:07.205
Yeah.

13:08.366 --> 13:10.259
That stuns me.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.095
Given how you've described him.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.486
He can be such a square.

13:14.511 --> 13:17.064
I think he was just looking
for a way to cut loose.

13:17.752 --> 13:19.032
Oh.

13:20.554 --> 13:22.743
Look, I really didn't
mean to offend you.

13:22.768 --> 13:26.595
I'm fine. It's just something
I... wasn't expecting.

13:28.744 --> 13:30.587
So are we friends again?

13:33.228 --> 13:35.025
Great. I'll go put these away.

13:35.050 --> 13:36.790
- Wait.
- Hmm?

13:43.035 --> 13:44.509
Oh, what the heck.

13:52.806 --> 13:54.212
But how did you find out?

13:54.237 --> 13:56.126
I've had my suspicions for a while,

13:56.151 --> 13:57.923
and then Brad finally admitted

13:57.948 --> 13:59.330
that he's been lying to me about Cindy

13:59.354 --> 14:01.181
the whole time we've been engaged.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.025
I know so many whores named Cindy.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.798
And did I mention she's fat?

14:04.823 --> 14:06.392
140 pounds if she's an ounce.

14:06.417 --> 14:09.032
Oh, 140, where did he find her,
a carnival?

14:09.538 --> 14:11.689
You know, darling,
it's not even noon yet.

14:11.714 --> 14:14.048
My fiancé fucked a beluga whale.

14:14.073 --> 14:16.384
Can I please get some support here?

14:16.409 --> 14:17.892
I'm sorry. Uh...

14:18.904 --> 14:21.299
So he's been sleeping
with Cindy this whole time?

14:21.324 --> 14:22.846
No, I didn't say that.

14:22.871 --> 14:24.369
I'm confused.

14:24.394 --> 14:26.666
He's been lying the whole time.

14:26.890 --> 14:29.362
They hooked up that weekend
you took me to Hawaii.

14:29.387 --> 14:30.667
Hang on, that was two years ago.

14:30.691 --> 14:32.494
Were you and Brad even engaged yet?

14:32.519 --> 14:34.580
No, but we were together.

14:34.605 --> 14:36.563
Mm, off and on.

14:36.588 --> 14:38.588
Okay, Brad hadn't proposed yet,

14:38.613 --> 14:40.197
but we both knew he was going to.

14:40.222 --> 14:41.447
Exactly.

14:41.472 --> 14:42.705
Yeah, or at least I knew.

14:42.730 --> 14:44.541
Well, maybe you should've told him.

14:44.566 --> 14:46.455
I can't believe you're
taking Brad's side.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.361
I'm just saying the situation is not

14:48.386 --> 14:50.080
quite so cut and dried.

14:50.105 --> 14:51.861
Brad is a good man.

14:51.886 --> 14:54.447
You might consider forgiveness.

14:54.472 --> 14:55.830
Forgiveness?

14:55.855 --> 14:58.525
Boy, did you marry
into the wrong family.

14:59.047 --> 15:00.783
I'm going to my room.

15:02.096 --> 15:03.416
Darling, I know you're upset,

15:03.441 --> 15:06.275
but when you drink without
a glass, Brad wins.

15:10.261 --> 15:11.470
Mmm.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.121
I don't think it's working.

15:16.146 --> 15:17.947
Takes a while to kick in.

15:18.387 --> 15:20.869
I hope I recognize the sensation.

15:21.230 --> 15:23.145
I'd hate to be high and miss it.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.390
Trust me, you'll know.

15:26.415 --> 15:30.080
Hey, want to order in Chinese
food and listen to records?

15:30.105 --> 15:32.291
Aren't you having dinner with
your married man tonight?

15:32.316 --> 15:34.840
That's tomorrow.
Tonight, Rob has plans with his wife.

15:37.357 --> 15:38.357
What?

15:38.382 --> 15:39.503
I don't know.
It's been planned for weeks.

15:39.527 --> 15:41.166
Some dinner party with his boss.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.010
Wednesday!

15:46.099 --> 15:47.611
Today is Wednesday.

15:47.636 --> 15:49.353
Yeah. Why?

15:49.756 --> 15:54.528
I was supposed to feed
my neighbor's cat on Monday.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.999
Oh! Poor Mittens.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.545
I should go.

15:58.570 --> 16:00.710
Damn it! Where's my other skate?

16:00.735 --> 16:03.725
- It's under your armpit.
- Oh, yes.

16:03.750 --> 16:06.999
Well, thank you for the reefer.

16:07.203 --> 16:08.311
Yeah.

16:31.159 --> 16:32.764
Where have you been?

16:32.789 --> 16:34.788
We need to leave in five minutes.

16:34.813 --> 16:36.085
I know, I know.

16:37.940 --> 16:39.647
Were you roller skating?

17:07.417 --> 17:09.419
Whoa.

17:11.147 --> 17:13.936
Come on. We have to go now.

17:29.701 --> 17:31.249
Let's go over a few things.

17:31.274 --> 17:33.702
When he's out of the office,
my boss likes to be called Hal.

17:33.727 --> 17:35.295
His wife is Vivian.

17:35.842 --> 17:37.155
Vivian.

17:37.180 --> 17:39.624
Dale and Gretchen Clark will be there.
He's tall.

17:39.649 --> 17:42.522
She's brunette.
Pamela and Joe, they'll be the old ones.

17:42.547 --> 17:45.186
And Myron Paul is coming,
he'll be the short one.

17:45.854 --> 17:47.475
Myron is short.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.381
The guest of honor is
Mr. Tashiro from Japan.

17:50.406 --> 17:52.241
Should be obvious who he is.

17:52.861 --> 17:54.467
Why?

17:55.418 --> 17:56.913
Is that a joke?

17:59.609 --> 18:00.686
Sure.

18:08.488 --> 18:11.928
Duke, please,
I've apologized, like, 20 times.

18:12.731 --> 18:16.303
What? Please, I'm begging you,

18:16.328 --> 18:17.983
please, don't hurt her.

18:18.516 --> 18:20.092
Duke! Duke, please.

18:20.117 --> 18:22.561
What is wrong with you?

18:22.586 --> 18:24.663
She's just a baby!

18:25.515 --> 18:26.678
Duke!

18:26.911 --> 18:28.381
Hello?

18:28.406 --> 18:30.022
Oh, my God.

18:30.047 --> 18:31.202
Jade, what's going on?

18:31.227 --> 18:33.163
Duke is gonna kill Teacup.

18:33.991 --> 18:35.163
- Teacup?
- Our dog.

18:35.188 --> 18:36.530
He says if I don't meet with him,

18:36.555 --> 18:38.131
he's gonna put her down.

18:38.257 --> 18:39.983
Holy shit.

18:40.008 --> 18:41.710
He can't do that, right?

18:41.735 --> 18:43.045
Legally?

18:43.464 --> 18:44.686
I'm honestly not sure.

18:44.711 --> 18:46.639
You don't think he'd hurt
his own dog, do you?

18:46.664 --> 18:49.436
He went to prison for
choking his accountant.

18:50.354 --> 18:52.053
My dad's an accountant.

18:52.078 --> 18:53.553
I have to go over there.

18:53.578 --> 18:54.983
I love that dog.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.661
Jade, it's too dangerous.

18:56.686 --> 18:58.389
I don't care. I have to save Teacup.

18:58.414 --> 19:00.024
Fine, fine,

19:00.049 --> 19:02.319
but you're not going alone.
I will go with you, okay?

19:02.344 --> 19:03.350
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.803
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

19:05.818 --> 19:07.147
Whoa, whoa.

19:07.172 --> 19:08.608
What about me?

19:10.260 --> 19:11.703
I-I'm just saying, you know, two's good,

19:11.727 --> 19:13.076
three's better, right?

19:13.854 --> 19:15.514
Yeah. Okay.

19:15.539 --> 19:17.237
All right.

19:35.055 --> 19:36.266
Oh.

19:36.626 --> 19:38.460
If that's Brad, I'm not here.

19:38.485 --> 19:41.772
Hello? Ah, good morning, Brad.

19:41.797 --> 19:42.952
I'm not here!

19:42.977 --> 19:44.500
Yes, actually, Amy's...

19:44.813 --> 19:46.336
Okay, yes, you heard that.

19:46.361 --> 19:47.536
Good!

19:48.169 --> 19:50.842
Look, I-I really couldn't say, Brad.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.406
I mean, you know women.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.087
Oh, I know. Tell me about it.

19:55.469 --> 19:56.741
Stop talking to him.

19:56.766 --> 19:59.281
Oh, no, if anything, worse.

19:59.813 --> 20:02.073
- No, I know it's ridiculous, but...
- Give me that.

20:05.259 --> 20:07.667
Right, well, uh, I'm off to the gallery.

20:08.022 --> 20:10.597
I'd love to start the day with a kiss.

20:10.622 --> 20:12.145
Mm. Ask the gardener.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.761
- Oh, I won't make that mistake twice.
- Hmm.

20:37.084 --> 20:38.605
- Tommy!
- I was up all night,

20:38.630 --> 20:40.722
thinking about our date,
and I-I was super upset,

20:40.747 --> 20:43.119
but I should not have walked out,
and I am sorry.

20:43.144 --> 20:45.215
Are you crazy? You can't come
to my house with flowers.

20:45.239 --> 20:46.511
I waited for Karl to leave.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.246
Well, he's not the only one
who could see you.

20:48.270 --> 20:50.776
- You have to go now.
- But, wait, at least take the flowers.

20:50.801 --> 20:52.573
- No!
- If you won't accept a simple gift,

20:52.598 --> 20:53.738
then what does that
say about our future?

20:53.762 --> 20:55.355
We have no future.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.644
- Are you breaking up with me?
- Yes, it's over. Now go.

20:57.669 --> 20:59.149
Tommy Harte?

21:00.068 --> 21:01.323
Amy?

21:02.463 --> 21:04.847
I haven't seen you since last Christmas.

21:04.872 --> 21:07.167
Yes, it's been a while.

21:07.192 --> 21:10.839
Hi. So who are the flowers for?

21:14.071 --> 21:16.339
They're for you, of course.

21:16.364 --> 21:17.730
For me?

21:17.755 --> 21:19.362
How did you know I was here?

21:20.345 --> 21:22.909
What a good question.

21:23.653 --> 21:28.152
Well, I called Naomi to tell her
the wedding was off,

21:28.177 --> 21:30.402
and she shared the bad news with Tommy,

21:30.427 --> 21:33.098
and then he brought you
this lovely bouquet.

21:33.623 --> 21:35.581
That's so sweet.

21:36.656 --> 21:38.144
You're welcome.

21:38.169 --> 21:39.590
Tommy, you should really go.

21:39.615 --> 21:42.598
Amy and I have million
things to do today.

21:42.623 --> 21:44.519
I'll just put these in your room.

21:44.544 --> 21:46.160
Well, it was very nice to see you, Amy.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.611
Tommy, are you free tonight?

21:50.204 --> 21:52.723
I don't know if you're
seeing anyone these days,

21:52.748 --> 21:55.142
but I could really use some cheering up.

21:59.228 --> 22:02.473
Well, I was seeing someone,

22:02.498 --> 22:05.894
but, uh, she recently broke up with me.

22:07.581 --> 22:10.769
Amy! You can't go out tonight.

22:10.794 --> 22:12.668
We have to let people
know the wedding's off.

22:12.693 --> 22:14.121
So there are calls to make.

22:14.146 --> 22:15.582
I'll make them tomorrow.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.855
So I'll see you at Herberto's, 7:00?

22:18.880 --> 22:20.941
We can console each other.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.293
That'll be nice.

22:23.628 --> 22:25.105
Goodbye, Mrs. Grove.

22:28.568 --> 22:32.224
Amy, what could you
possibly be thinking?

22:32.249 --> 22:34.199
Well, I'm thinking I'm going to have

22:34.224 --> 22:36.301
revenge sex with Tommy Harte.

22:36.866 --> 22:39.402
Well, uh... you can't do that.

22:39.427 --> 22:41.301
He's not even your type.

22:41.326 --> 22:44.724
I know he's a little young,
but he's gotta learn from someone.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.927
So you're-you're telling me
that this took four hours?

23:02.952 --> 23:04.022
Well, yes.

23:04.046 --> 23:05.834
- That's very impressive.
- That was the quick version.

23:07.726 --> 23:09.122
Oh, there they are. Hey.

23:09.147 --> 23:11.927
We were just about to
send out a search party.

23:11.952 --> 23:14.419
So sorry. It takes Beth Ann
a while to get dressed.

23:14.444 --> 23:15.444
Yes.

23:15.469 --> 23:16.865
So I recall.

23:18.917 --> 23:21.341
This is my wife, Vivian.

23:21.366 --> 23:24.872
It is so lovely to meet you, Beth Ann.

23:24.897 --> 23:29.208
And I want to introduce you
to Gretchen and Dale Clarkson,

23:29.233 --> 23:31.388
- and Pamela and Joe Kensington.
- Hi.

23:32.123 --> 23:33.560
Where's Myron?

23:33.659 --> 23:36.661
- Oh, Myron had to cancel
- Oh.

23:36.686 --> 23:37.982
Oh, here's our guest of honor.

23:38.007 --> 23:40.333
This is the young executive
I was telling you about.

23:40.358 --> 23:42.279
- Robert Stanton.
- Sir, it's an honor.

23:42.304 --> 23:44.677
I've heard a lot of wonderful
things about your work.

23:44.702 --> 23:46.865
I hope I live up to your expectation.

23:46.890 --> 23:49.544
So Myron's not here?

23:49.957 --> 23:51.490
Uh, no.

23:52.376 --> 23:53.654
Dinner is served.

23:53.679 --> 23:55.638
- Shall we?
- Thank goodness. Yes.

23:55.663 --> 23:57.685
Thank you. I'm starving.

23:58.651 --> 24:00.174
What is your name?

24:00.412 --> 24:01.904
Beth Ann.

24:02.893 --> 24:05.232
You must be Tashiro.

24:05.257 --> 24:06.646
I am.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.841
You were right.

24:11.089 --> 24:13.060
It was obvious.

24:16.285 --> 24:18.021
I made place cards for everyone.

24:18.046 --> 24:20.318
Uh, Mr. Tashiro,
you'll be right here in the center.

24:20.343 --> 24:21.780
Thank you.

24:23.683 --> 24:26.357
Um, Beth Ann,
did you find your place card?

24:28.482 --> 24:29.661
Honey?

24:31.604 --> 24:34.263
Sorry, I was looking at the swan.

24:34.288 --> 24:35.732
Do you like it?

24:36.282 --> 24:39.552
It's the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.

24:39.577 --> 24:42.449
That is so sweet of you to notice.

24:42.474 --> 24:43.823
Most don't.

24:44.386 --> 24:45.669
Rob,

24:45.927 --> 24:48.294
do you see this?

24:49.807 --> 24:51.404
It's very pretty.

24:51.429 --> 24:52.997
Now put it on your lap.

24:53.022 --> 24:55.411
Oh, I don't want to unfold it,
it took too much work.

24:55.436 --> 24:57.443
It's fine, Beth Ann, I'm, uh...

24:57.468 --> 24:58.927
I'm sure it's not that difficult.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.661
How would you know?

25:00.686 --> 25:01.849
Sweetie, don't you, uh,

25:01.874 --> 25:03.194
do this at all our dinner parties?

25:03.218 --> 25:05.169
Well, do you think that makes it easy?

25:05.194 --> 25:07.622
I'm sure I could do it if I tried.

25:08.919 --> 25:10.786
I bet you couldn't!

25:12.432 --> 25:13.911
That sounds like a challenge.

25:13.936 --> 25:15.981
No, no, she's not challenging you.

25:16.006 --> 25:19.201
Make a swan. I dare you.

25:20.585 --> 25:21.630
Well...

25:21.655 --> 25:23.966
She's feisty. You're on.

25:23.991 --> 25:26.443
Oh, well, this should
be very interesting.

25:26.468 --> 25:29.074
Oh, piece of cake.
Come on. How would I begin?

25:29.099 --> 25:30.857
I think you've got to
lay it flat to start.

25:31.388 --> 25:32.388
Brilliant.

25:34.507 --> 25:36.958
The-the-the trick is in
the first fold, am-am I right?

25:36.983 --> 25:38.654
- Well, I'm not helping you.
- Great.

25:38.679 --> 25:41.115
Wait, wait, wait. Almost...

25:41.140 --> 25:42.140
Got it.

25:42.968 --> 25:44.091
Keep your day job.

25:44.116 --> 25:45.951
Not so easy, is it?

25:45.976 --> 25:48.185
All right, I'm gonna get it this time.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.263
Honey, I dropped my fork on the floor.

25:51.288 --> 25:52.463
Would you get it for me?

25:52.886 --> 25:54.154
Sure.

25:58.509 --> 26:00.341
What is wrong with you? Huh?

26:01.189 --> 26:03.234
You're acting like you're drunk.

26:03.259 --> 26:04.474
Am I?

26:06.238 --> 26:08.294
That might be the pot.

26:08.319 --> 26:09.716
Pot?

26:10.255 --> 26:12.208
That means marijuana.

26:12.233 --> 26:14.061
I had some before dinner.

26:14.086 --> 26:16.779
Where in God's name
did you get marijuana?

26:17.503 --> 26:19.044
What's wrong?

26:19.325 --> 26:21.388
Am I not allowed to cut loose?

26:21.970 --> 26:24.215
We will talk about this later.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.240
Good.

26:25.658 --> 26:30.154
Then you can tell me where
you get your marijuana.

26:30.669 --> 26:31.818
What?

26:31.843 --> 26:33.279
That's right.

26:34.733 --> 26:37.365
I know what you've been up to.

26:42.994 --> 26:43.994
All right.

26:44.257 --> 26:46.521
- It's impossible. I give up.
- Oh.

26:46.546 --> 26:49.044
Here, here. Let me help you.

26:49.069 --> 26:50.279
Thank you, my dear.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.724
It's more like a duck.

26:58.547 --> 26:59.888
This is it.

26:59.913 --> 27:02.437
Duke's place is just down the pathway.

27:03.276 --> 27:04.513
Okay...

27:04.757 --> 27:05.779
let's do this.

27:05.804 --> 27:07.857
Okay, why are you talking like that?

27:08.388 --> 27:09.607
Like what?

27:09.799 --> 27:12.366
Like the star of a
low-budget action film.

27:12.391 --> 27:14.497
What? I'm not doing that.

27:15.302 --> 27:17.478
All right, let's stay close, people.

27:21.613 --> 27:22.872
Here we are.

27:22.897 --> 27:24.310
- What's the plan?
- Okay,

27:24.335 --> 27:25.858
so I'm gonna knock on the door.

27:25.883 --> 27:28.076
When Duke answers, I'll confront him...

27:28.101 --> 27:29.779
No confronting.

27:29.804 --> 27:31.115
Duke is a violent felon.

27:31.140 --> 27:32.315
Are you crazy?

27:34.617 --> 27:36.122
You brought a hammer?

27:36.147 --> 27:38.552
I prefer to call this "Plan B."

27:38.577 --> 27:40.560
That's your plan B, aggravated assault?

27:40.585 --> 27:42.146
It's not assault if he hits me first.

27:42.171 --> 27:44.513
Oh, he will definitely hit you first.

27:45.388 --> 27:47.185
Great, great, anyway,

27:47.210 --> 27:49.685
so while we're struggling,
Jade's gonna rush in,

27:49.710 --> 27:51.581
she's gonna grab the
dog, and then we run.

27:51.606 --> 27:53.701
Honey, that is a stupid plan.

27:53.726 --> 27:55.857
That's a bit harsh,
but, okay, fine, you go.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.607
Here's my plan: Duke opens the door

27:57.632 --> 27:59.193
and I write him
a massive check for the dog.

27:59.217 --> 28:02.708
Oh, that's good. Duke is always broke.

28:03.698 --> 28:04.827
Fine. I mean,
if you want to be the kind of person

28:04.851 --> 28:06.647
that just solves all of
her problems with money.

28:06.671 --> 28:08.146
I very much do.

28:08.171 --> 28:09.732
Jade, go ahead.

28:13.628 --> 28:15.013
Duke!

28:16.921 --> 28:17.921
Oh, my God.

28:17.946 --> 28:18.946
Oh, my God.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.574
Oh, my God, it's Teacup.

28:21.599 --> 28:23.849
Honey, honey, it's okay.

28:23.874 --> 28:25.380
Mommy's here.

28:26.419 --> 28:27.555
I guess Duke's not home.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.333
No, no, no. No, no, no.

28:29.358 --> 28:31.154
He's definitely, definitely home.

28:31.179 --> 28:32.702
He doesn't go to work till 5:00.

28:35.518 --> 28:37.372
Alright. Come on, Duke, open up.

28:40.341 --> 28:41.435
Okay.

28:41.460 --> 28:43.599
He's clearly not home. You know what?

28:43.624 --> 28:46.857
We'll just write him a note
and we'll say that you came by

28:46.882 --> 28:49.754
and you are willing to make him
a generous offer to buy the dog.

28:50.783 --> 28:52.880
W-What, w-we're just
gonna leave her here?

28:52.905 --> 28:55.029
For now, yeah.

28:56.475 --> 28:58.390
Okay, I left my pen in the car. Hold on.

29:01.092 --> 29:02.576
I don't like this.

29:02.601 --> 29:04.864
I know, but, I mean,
what else can we do?

29:04.889 --> 29:06.530
You don't understand,
if something happens to my dog,

29:06.554 --> 29:08.560
I will fucking lose my mind.

29:08.585 --> 29:10.990
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Please, please, please.

29:26.704 --> 29:27.966
Start the car!

29:27.991 --> 29:30.630
What? Oh, shit.

29:31.225 --> 29:32.763
Start the car now.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.138
Jade!

29:43.491 --> 29:44.872
You bitch!

29:45.944 --> 29:47.741
You're fucking dead!

29:55.330 --> 29:57.763
Mom, have you seen my car keys?

29:57.788 --> 29:59.616
I'm gonna be late to meet Tommy.

29:59.641 --> 30:00.898
Sorry.

30:02.438 --> 30:04.708
I could've sworn they were in my jacket.

30:07.187 --> 30:08.536
What the hell?

30:08.904 --> 30:10.036
I'm going on a date

30:10.061 --> 30:11.841
and you're inviting
Aunt Kay to the wedding?

30:11.866 --> 30:13.115
That makes no sense.

30:13.140 --> 30:16.404
I know she's dull, but she's
good for a gravy boat at least.

30:16.429 --> 30:18.279
I'm not getting married. Okay?

30:18.304 --> 30:20.826
I'm going to meet Tommy Harte for sex,

30:20.851 --> 30:22.786
if I ever find my damn keys.

30:22.986 --> 30:25.349
Yes, dear. If.

30:27.494 --> 30:29.061
Did you hide my keys?

30:29.434 --> 30:32.630
Yes. And once you've calmed
down, you'll thank me. Sit.

30:32.655 --> 30:34.701
No! Where are my keys?

30:34.726 --> 30:36.294
They're not in my purse.

30:39.847 --> 30:41.155
I told you they weren't in there.

30:41.179 --> 30:42.958
Fine, keep the keys. I'll walk.

30:42.983 --> 30:45.599
In those heels, you won't
make it past the driveway.

30:46.106 --> 30:48.615
I know you're upset,
but if you sleep with Tommy,

30:48.640 --> 30:50.310
you're slamming
the door on Brad forever.

30:50.335 --> 30:52.404
I know. That's the point.

30:52.429 --> 30:54.605
But you love him, and he loves you.

30:54.630 --> 30:56.544
The hall's booked,
the caterer's been paid,

30:56.569 --> 30:57.990
your dress is gorgeous.

30:58.015 --> 31:00.740
Why are you on Brad's side?
What's changed?

31:00.765 --> 31:02.396
Who got to you?

31:02.619 --> 31:03.810
Hello.

31:03.935 --> 31:04.974
Was it him?

31:04.999 --> 31:06.896
It was you. This is all your fault.

31:06.921 --> 31:09.607
Yes, I'm sure it is.
Sorry, what are we talking about?

31:09.632 --> 31:13.419
Amy's decided to pay Brad
back by seducing Tommy Harte.

31:13.444 --> 31:16.130
Tommy? Isn't he a little young for you?

31:16.155 --> 31:17.794
What is he, 17?

31:17.819 --> 31:19.982
He's 18 and mature for his age.

31:22.144 --> 31:23.599
But that's beside the point.

31:23.624 --> 31:25.017
You made a promise, young lady,

31:25.042 --> 31:27.529
to Brad, to us,
and to the Biltmore Hotel.

31:27.554 --> 31:29.943
Oh, you're one to talk about promises.

31:29.968 --> 31:32.419
You divorced Daddy, the guy after him,

31:32.444 --> 31:33.826
and now with Karl sleeping

31:33.851 --> 31:36.661
in the guest room, I'm assuming
he's on his way out as well.

31:37.277 --> 31:38.310
Look.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.154
I love Brad,

31:40.179 --> 31:42.138
but I don't know if I can trust him,

31:42.642 --> 31:44.383
and I don't want to be another you.

31:45.238 --> 31:47.414
With three husbands by 40.

31:54.773 --> 31:56.583
Your keys are in the freezer.

31:57.061 --> 31:58.177
Go.

31:58.752 --> 32:01.888
A-Amy, Amy. You're right.

32:03.198 --> 32:06.724
Your mother and I are
sorting through some issues,

32:06.749 --> 32:09.044
and I'm not a perfect husband,

32:09.069 --> 32:10.786
and maybe Brad won't be either,

32:10.811 --> 32:13.204
but love is always a risk,

32:13.547 --> 32:16.497
and I know it's easy to think
this is never going to last,

32:16.522 --> 32:19.089
so why don't I end it now, but...

32:19.670 --> 32:23.065
the chance for love doesn't
come around every day.

32:23.318 --> 32:26.673
One must think long and hard
before one casts it aside.

32:28.975 --> 32:32.095
Mm. Tommy's waiting.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.556
Oh, go, go. I...

32:33.581 --> 32:35.595
I hope you have a nice dinner.

32:43.666 --> 32:45.016
Do you, uh...

32:45.587 --> 32:47.587
think my pretty speech helped?

32:49.247 --> 32:51.162
More than you know.

32:52.153 --> 32:53.961
I need to make a phone call.

33:01.369 --> 33:03.000
My baby.

33:04.601 --> 33:08.300
I'm gonna take Teacup upstairs.
It's nice and quiet up there.

33:08.325 --> 33:10.191
Yeah. She's had a stressful day.

33:11.097 --> 33:12.215
What you did today,

33:12.240 --> 33:14.840
that was the nicest thing that
anyone's ever done for me.

33:14.865 --> 33:17.715
- Oh. No big deal.
- No. It absolutely was.

33:18.081 --> 33:19.371
- Ow!
- Oh...

33:19.396 --> 33:20.816
Son of a bitch.

33:22.028 --> 33:24.222
Please hide this.
Somewhere he can't find it.

33:24.247 --> 33:26.075
Okay. Thanks.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.246
Come on, Teacup.

33:27.271 --> 33:28.918
Oh, that's a good girl.

33:33.916 --> 33:35.074
It's a good day, huh?

33:35.099 --> 33:36.448
Is it?

33:36.473 --> 33:38.527
I mean, we got the dog back, didn't we?

33:40.895 --> 33:44.621
All right. I know we might've
broken the law a little bit.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.113
You broke the law, a lot.

33:48.138 --> 33:50.207
And you made me an accomplice.

33:50.232 --> 33:52.769
All right, yeah, but you saw
how happy it made Jade, right?

33:52.794 --> 33:55.543
- I think it was worth it.
- Absolutely, you're right.

33:55.568 --> 33:58.090
The smile on Jade's
face more than makes up

33:58.115 --> 34:00.175
for the fact that I could be disbarred.

34:00.990 --> 34:03.550
I'm sorry.
I mean, I had to do something.

34:03.575 --> 34:06.480
No, you didn't. I had a plan.

34:07.010 --> 34:08.566
Yeah? So did I.

34:08.591 --> 34:10.027
Mine actually worked.

34:10.052 --> 34:11.105
That's not the point.

34:11.130 --> 34:13.457
Oh, no, no, no, no.
The point is that I finally do

34:13.482 --> 34:15.481
something right and you
can't even be happy about it.

34:15.505 --> 34:17.519
What am I supposed to be happy about?

34:17.544 --> 34:20.144
For the last two years,
I've been pathetic Eli

34:20.169 --> 34:21.957
who-who can't finish a screenplay,

34:21.982 --> 34:24.129
who can't help pay the bills.
I-I get it.

34:24.154 --> 34:26.340
You're frustrated with me.
Well, guess what?

34:26.460 --> 34:28.505
I'm frustrated with me, too.

34:28.956 --> 34:31.152
- Eli, you're not pathetic.
- No?

34:31.177 --> 34:33.707
'Cause this morning,
I couldn't even defend my own home.

34:33.732 --> 34:34.988
My wife had to come save me.

34:35.013 --> 34:36.700
'Cause I thought he was
gonna beat you to a pulp.

34:36.724 --> 34:37.941
He probably would have.

34:37.966 --> 34:39.652
But the fact that you had to step in,

34:39.677 --> 34:41.505
that makes it hurt even worse.

34:43.090 --> 34:45.550
- I was just trying to be helpful.
- I know.

34:45.575 --> 34:46.957
But sometimes, honey,

34:46.982 --> 34:48.941
I just need a fucking win.

34:49.181 --> 34:51.863
Okay? I just want to feel like a man

34:51.888 --> 34:54.630
and save a dog and have
that be good enough.

34:57.423 --> 34:58.598
You're right.

34:59.982 --> 35:01.755
- It was a good day.
- Thank you.

35:04.678 --> 35:06.614
I didn't lock the door.

35:07.139 --> 35:08.958
Okay, all right. Call the police.

35:10.625 --> 35:13.599
Hey. Look, hey,
man, l-let me just start

35:13.624 --> 35:15.114
by offering my...

35:16.076 --> 35:17.349
No!

35:17.795 --> 35:19.622
Get off me, you bitch!

35:21.555 --> 35:22.700
Jade!

35:23.099 --> 35:24.099
Jade!

35:29.342 --> 35:30.888
Jade!

35:33.825 --> 35:35.411
Where the fuck is she?

35:56.015 --> 35:58.903
You broke my leg, you crazy bitch!

35:59.471 --> 36:02.653
Fuck with my family again,
and I'll break the other one.

36:09.393 --> 36:11.364
- How's your food?
- Excellent.

36:11.967 --> 36:14.599
- Yours?
- Yeah, it's-it's really good.

36:14.624 --> 36:15.974
Good.

36:17.752 --> 36:19.716
So you're going to college in the fall?

36:19.741 --> 36:22.222
- Art school.
- Oh, that's right.

36:22.247 --> 36:23.919
You like to draw.

36:24.642 --> 36:26.165
That's cute.

36:27.177 --> 36:28.544
Yeah.

36:30.610 --> 36:32.653
Oh, what the hell?

36:33.224 --> 36:36.489
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
Hello, Tommy.

36:36.514 --> 36:37.544
Mrs. Grove.

36:37.569 --> 36:38.962
What are you doing here, Mom?

36:39.096 --> 36:40.620
I need a moment.

36:40.645 --> 36:42.028
For what?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.100
I brought someone.

36:44.125 --> 36:46.552
Brad would like to talk to you.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.786
I'm in the middle of dinner.

36:50.811 --> 36:53.747
Well, Tommy doesn't mind. Do you?

36:54.142 --> 36:55.309
No.

37:02.032 --> 37:04.904
- Simone...
- Don't look at me.

37:04.929 --> 37:06.607
People will see.

37:07.646 --> 37:08.786
Okay.

37:10.261 --> 37:11.537
There's something I want to say.

37:11.561 --> 37:14.224
Look, I only went out with
Amy to make you jealous.

37:14.730 --> 37:18.286
It was a, it was dumb thing to do.
I was just hurt, you know?

37:18.311 --> 37:20.997
Because I like you so much.

37:21.306 --> 37:24.513
But I was thinking that
if we put a name to what

37:24.538 --> 37:27.802
we've been doing, then I would know
how you felt about me,

37:27.827 --> 37:30.161
but you're not into it, so I'll...
I will back off.

37:30.186 --> 37:31.884
You can look at me now.

37:40.890 --> 37:43.893
I must really like you a lot
to wear this god-awful thing.

37:50.241 --> 37:51.482
Well.

37:52.191 --> 37:53.708
I guess the wedding's back on, then.

37:53.733 --> 37:55.591
Oh. Apparently so.

37:56.873 --> 37:58.302
Back to us.

37:58.646 --> 37:59.979
Are you free Friday?

38:00.700 --> 38:01.700
Yes, ma'am.

38:01.725 --> 38:04.099
Don't call me ma'am.

38:04.124 --> 38:05.966
Yes, lover.

38:07.830 --> 38:09.482
Ma'am will be fine.

38:14.681 --> 38:17.341
Thank you again for inviting us.
Everything was lovely.

38:17.366 --> 38:19.114
We are so glad you came.

38:19.139 --> 38:21.528
I can't remember the last
time we laughed so hard.

38:21.553 --> 38:23.607
You're an absolute delight.

38:24.642 --> 38:26.905
I hope we see you again very soon.

38:27.519 --> 38:29.302
Robert, you're a lucky man, son.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.005
Hope you know that.

38:32.505 --> 38:33.669
Yes, sir.

38:36.496 --> 38:38.122
- Good night.
- Good night.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.739
So how did you figure it out?

39:05.255 --> 39:09.172
Oh, crap. I left a joint
in my pocket, didn't I?

39:10.592 --> 39:11.985
You did.

39:12.010 --> 39:13.489
You absolutely did.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.974
I knew something was up.

39:16.545 --> 39:18.724
You've been acting strangely for weeks.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.456
So why did you smoke it?

39:23.922 --> 39:25.403
To get back at me?

39:28.619 --> 39:29.919
Well...

39:30.729 --> 39:32.239
I don't blame you.

39:34.222 --> 39:35.692
I'm sorry.

39:41.131 --> 39:42.974
My walk on the wild side is over.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.817
Won't happen again.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.060
I have one question.

40:01.085 --> 40:02.085
What's that?

40:02.110 --> 40:04.052
Why did you want to try marijuana?

40:08.996 --> 40:11.505
I thought it would be
fun to break the rules.

40:12.093 --> 40:14.692
Does that sound... stupid?

40:16.439 --> 40:18.311
Not at all.

40:18.487 --> 40:23.646
My life feels like one of
those stupid swan napkins.

40:23.671 --> 40:27.888
It's rigid, it's all tight folds
and sharp edges.

40:27.913 --> 40:29.393
And people admire it,

40:29.658 --> 40:33.370
but it takes so much work.

40:33.952 --> 40:36.253
And it's goddamned exhausting.

40:36.965 --> 40:38.444
Course it is.

40:40.985 --> 40:43.987
We've forgotten to find
time in our life for joy.

40:44.026 --> 40:45.385
Joy?

40:45.888 --> 40:48.456
Hell, I'd settle for a
few laughs now and then.

40:49.437 --> 40:51.401
I would love to hear you laugh again.

40:52.738 --> 40:54.846
I'd break every rule
in the book for that.

40:57.662 --> 40:58.662
I'm starting to realize

40:58.687 --> 41:00.823
you're not the good little
girl I thought you were.

41:02.804 --> 41:04.023
No, sir.

41:04.589 --> 41:06.120
I'm a rebel.

41:07.867 --> 41:10.940
Okay. Okay.

41:13.068 --> 41:16.174
We've got to do something, tonight.

41:16.389 --> 41:17.721
Something...

41:19.167 --> 41:20.534
crazy!

41:20.559 --> 41:22.784
Crazy and hilarious.

41:22.809 --> 41:25.198
But what? I mean...
what can we do? What?

41:25.223 --> 41:28.167
I'm actually getting excited.

41:35.578 --> 41:36.971
Rob...

41:43.507 --> 41:45.213
We're being too loud.

41:45.238 --> 41:46.807
I thought you were a rebel.

41:47.741 --> 41:49.096
You're right.

41:55.923 --> 41:58.159
If you visit your local morgue,

41:58.184 --> 42:00.596
you'll find the bodies of good people

42:00.621 --> 42:03.026
who made bad choices.

42:06.174 --> 42:09.346
Some engaged in reckless love affairs.

42:11.418 --> 42:15.588
Some invited violent
strangers into their home.

42:16.416 --> 42:18.956
And some kept dark secrets

42:18.981 --> 42:21.878
from those they loved.

42:22.809 --> 42:27.625
Yes, it's choices like these
that lead to death.

42:29.623 --> 42:32.938
And more importantly, murder.
