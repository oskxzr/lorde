I'm curious,

10:48.791 --> 10:51.836
have you had a chance to
discuss Rob's expectations?

10:52.266 --> 10:55.516
- Expectations?
- Well, you want a career.

their wives to work.

Oh, well,
Rob knows I want to be a singer.

11:00.354 --> 11:01.969
We've talked about it a lot.

No.

his wife in the kitchen,

pouring his martini.

You may want to sit down
