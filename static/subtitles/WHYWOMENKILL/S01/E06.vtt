I'm coming. Hold your horses.

Amy.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.981
Are you coming with
us to the dinner?

11:18.025 --> 11:20.244
We assumed you'd be going
with Brad and his family.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.290
I was with them all day.
I need a break.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.944
Oh, are they really that bad?

11:23.987 --> 11:25.554
Do you know much about tractors?

11:25.597 --> 11:27.556
Um, no.

11:27.599 --> 11:31.952
You will by dessert.I think you deserve a drink.

is very pleased

that you're making
such an effort.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.136
And if I make a good impression,

11:42.179 --> 11:43.790
his parents might
buy us a house.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.313
Ooh.
A house?

11:45.356 --> 11:47.315
As a wedding gift?

11:47.358 --> 11:49.883
Darling, we really need
to rethink those fondue forks.

11:49.926 --> 11:53.495
Their farm sits
on millions of gallons of oil.

11:53.538 --> 11:56.411
So whatever you think of them,
be nice.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.457

What's your excuse this time?

It's a charming story.

I mean, until he dropped me.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.778
Why did he drop you?

stopped scheduling appointments.

what I dream about?

17:08.157 --> 17:09.680
Now, why don't you
want grandkids?

17:09.724 --> 17:12.292
Well, I'd have to tell people
that I'm a grandmother.

17:12.335 --> 17:15.338
And let's face it,
who's gonna believe me?

17:19.516 --> 17:20.735
Does anyone need
more champagne?

17:20.778 --> 17:22.302
Oh, God, yes.

to use the facilities.

sound fancy.

[Dwight and Ruby laugh]

17:39.884 --> 17:41.843
It is done!
I just wrote the words

I mean, the characters,
the plot, all of it.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.254
I mean, I probably
used the word "fuck"

18:01.297 --> 18:02.907
about 60 times too many,
but that's fixable.

18:02.951 --> 18:05.910
I mean, the point is: I may
actually be a good writer.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.826

to celebrate.

Yeah.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.893
Hmm.Not to change the subject,

18:31.936 --> 18:33.590
but I'm curious about something.

18:33.634 --> 18:34.852
What's up?

18:34.896 --> 18:37.681
While I was away,
did you two fuck?

18:39.770 --> 18:41.511
I don't know why,
I just have a feeling.

18:41.555 --> 18:42.599
Am I crazy?

18:45.559 --> 18:48.431
We absolutely fucked.

18:48.475 --> 18:49.824
Yeah.

18:49.867 --> 18:53.610
Shit. Wow. Hmm.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.918
Are you upset?

18:56.961 --> 18:59.529
Um...

18:59.573 --> 19:00.922
I'm not sure.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.579
It's not like you and I have
never done it without Eli.

19:05.622 --> 19:06.754

19:07.798 --> 19:10.801
That's true.
Mm.

19:12.847 --> 19:13.935
Okay.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.764
Okay?

19:16.807 --> 19:18.026
I mean, obviously
I have some feelings

19:18.069 --> 19:19.767
that I need to work through,

19:19.810 --> 19:21.725
but this was...
this was bound to happen, right?

19:21.769 --> 19:23.597
At some point,
since we're all together now.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.512
And I love you both,

19:25.555 --> 19:29.298
so why... why would I not want
you guys to get closer?

19:29.342 --> 19:31.866
Yes, exactly, and I-I knew
that if we were just open

19:31.909 --> 19:33.259
and honest about
the whole thing,

19:33.302 --> 19:35.783
that it wouldn't
be a big deal.

19:35.826 --> 19:38.786
Yeah. Well, thank you
for telling me the truth.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.048
It feels good to know.Of course.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.398
Of course.Mm-hmm.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.052
Oh, you know what,
you should tell Lamar

19:44.095 --> 19:47.316
that I know the manager
at La Serata,

19:47.360 --> 19:49.013
so she can get us
a good table.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.928
Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.278
Totally. Great call.[phone chimes]

19:52.321 --> 19:54.454
I will, um...

19:54.497 --> 19:56.064
I-I will, I will
text Lamar right now.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.500
Okay.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.373
[phone chimes]

20:07.075 --> 20:10.731
So I can tell Rob is still
mad about the other night.

20:10.774 --> 20:12.602
He hasn't called in days.

20:12.646 --> 20:13.821
I thought about
calling him,

20:13.864 --> 20:15.039
but I don't want
to seem desperate,

20:15.083 --> 20:16.476
although I am
a little bit,

20:16.519 --> 20:17.781
but he doesn't need
to know that.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.479
Anyway...
[chuckles]

20:19.522 --> 20:21.481
what do you think I should do?

20:21.524 --> 20:23.439
Hmm. What?

20:23.483 --> 20:25.963
[chuckles]
Listen to me.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.531
I must be boring you to tears
always talking about Rob.

20:28.575 --> 20:29.880
No, I'm sorry.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.665
I was thinking about
this woman I met today.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.493
I can't get her
out of my mind.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.798
Why?

20:34.842 --> 20:36.670
I was at her door
dropping something off,

20:36.713 --> 20:39.325
and, just, something
wasn't quite right.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.327
How do you mean?

20:41.370 --> 20:44.547
She was worried about
her husband.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.680
I could hear him
calling for her.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.551
There was just
something about his tone.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.988
It scared me.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.642
Then he came to the door,

20:52.686 --> 20:55.515
and he was charming.

20:55.558 --> 21:00.476
This woman, was she wearing
a lot of makeup?

21:00.520 --> 21:02.478
She was.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.132
How did you know that?

21:05.176 --> 21:06.569
He hits her.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.484
You think?

21:08.528 --> 21:11.357
No, he isn't the type.
He's very successful.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.576
My father was a doctor.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.364
I used to watch my mother
apply makeup

21:18.407 --> 21:20.540
to cover up her black eyes.

21:20.583 --> 21:23.151
Oh, no.

21:24.761 --> 21:27.416
She would smear green concealer
to cover the bruise,

21:27.460 --> 21:29.679
and then she would apply
a second layer of concealer

21:29.723 --> 21:31.551
that matched her skin tone.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.988
And then she would do
the same thing to the other side

21:34.031 --> 21:36.599
so that people wouldn't
notice the difference.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.516
That's awful.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.910
No, here's the awful part.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.914
My whole family knew
what was going on.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.176
Aunts, uncles,

21:48.219 --> 21:50.396
cousins-- they all knew
what he was doing,

21:50.439 --> 21:52.006
and they just looked
the other way.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.618
I hate people that
look the other way.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.584
And he told the owner
he was willing to match

22:04.627 --> 22:06.542
any offer the Gibson twins

22:06.586 --> 22:08.065
could come up with.

22:08.109 --> 22:10.546
[laughs]
And that's how

22:10.590 --> 22:13.897
Dwight cornered the
Tulsa County market

22:13.941 --> 22:15.421
for earth-moving machinery.

22:15.464 --> 22:16.422
[laughter]

22:16.465 --> 22:17.553
The next thing that happened...

22:17.597 --> 22:18.859
Please stop!

22:21.470 --> 22:24.952
Until I find Karl.
[laughs]

22:24.995 --> 22:28.651
He would hate to miss
this amazing story.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.697
DWIGHT:
He has been

22:30.740 --> 22:32.089
in the gents' room
quite a while.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.439
Uh, you want me
to check on him?

22:33.482 --> 22:36.964
[laughs]:
No. I-I've got this.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.105
Ma'am, that's the men's room.Oh, I know.

22:48.149 --> 22:51.152
My husband isn't hiding out
in the ladies' room.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.719
[gasps]

23:01.118 --> 23:02.685
So nice to finally
meet you, Lamar.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.513
I've heard so much about you.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.733
Heard a lot about
you, too, pretty lady.

23:06.776 --> 23:08.604
And I have so many questions.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.998
Please don't ask them.[laughs] Come on.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.043
I'm paying for this meal.
All I want in exchange is

23:13.087 --> 23:15.742
a few juicy details
about your new lifestyle.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.439
All right, dude,
don't embarrass me.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.441
I wouldn't ask
if I didn't need to know.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.008
Why do you need to know?

23:21.051 --> 23:23.532
Truth is, I've been
thinking about

23:23.576 --> 23:26.753
bringing another woman into
my relationship with Delores.

23:26.796 --> 23:27.928
And she's open
to the idea?

23:27.971 --> 23:29.669
Absolutely not.[laughter]

23:30.974 --> 23:32.106
All right, okay,
all right.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.500
Let's talk about my script.Mm-hmm.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.676
Eli said that you
think it's good.
No.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.068
I think it's brilliant.

23:38.112 --> 23:40.549
Okay, just tell me it'll sell.Oh, yes.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.987
I already got four
different producers interested.

23:44.031 --> 23:47.164
I'm expecting offers
in the high six-figure range.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.688

not money.

23:52.953 --> 23:54.955
Wow. I-I've never had a script

23:54.998 --> 23:56.478
get that kind
of reaction before.

23:56.522 --> 23:59.002
You've never written a script
this commercial before.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.091
And I guess we have you
to thank for that.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.484
[laughs]:
Stop.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.617
What?

24:04.660 --> 24:05.966
It just--

24:06.009 --> 24:08.229
Eli was having some
problems with his story,

24:08.272 --> 24:09.926
so I read the
first 50 pages,

24:09.970 --> 24:11.972
and I-I gave him
a few ideas.

24:12.015 --> 24:14.148
More than a few. I mean, she
saved my ass is what she did.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.758
That part at the end,
where-where Eva,

24:15.802 --> 24:17.238

and goes,

24:17.281 --> 24:18.587

arsonist on everybody?

24:18.631 --> 24:20.807
Mm-hmm.Jade's idea.

24:20.850 --> 24:21.982
Cool.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.462
ELI:
Mm.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.900
So, you let her read the script
before it was finished?

24:26.943 --> 24:29.032
W-Well, yeah.

24:29.076 --> 24:32.558
'Cause you never
let me do that.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.560
[chuckles softly]No-- h-honey,

24:34.603 --> 24:35.996
my back was up
against the wall on this.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.824
I mean...
Huh.I-I also,

24:37.867 --> 24:40.130
I-I gave him
some thoughts

24:40.174 --> 24:41.741
on the lead character.
You know, I have insight

24:41.784 --> 24:44.657
into the millennial
female brain.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.180
And it shows.

24:46.223 --> 24:49.096
Eva is the-the best character
he's ever created.

24:49.139 --> 24:50.576
Ah, I-I don't know about that.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.186
I do. Trust me, Eli.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.667
Be good to Jade.
She's your muse.

doing any writing yourself?

I actually have
a couple script ideas, yeah.

Well, I would love
to hear about them.

my replacement, so please.

25:22.085 --> 25:24.697

carried away.

We haven't seen
each other in years.

25:26.742 --> 25:30.224
Oh, my God. Is that why
you dropped me as a client?

25:30.267 --> 25:32.661
Because you were screwing
my husband!

25:32.705 --> 25:35.055
I couldn't look you
in the eye anymore.

25:35.098 --> 25:37.231
It was impossible
to trim your bangs.

25:37.274 --> 25:40.277
I think you should leave now.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.759
For what it's worth,

25:43.803 --> 25:45.239
I love the layers.

25:45.282 --> 25:46.283
Go.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.243

You can't be
completely shocked.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.899
You knew perfectly well
I slept with men.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.683
But with Hector?

25:54.727 --> 25:57.817
You're surprised that the man I
slept with was your hairdresser?

25:57.860 --> 26:01.603
That is the gay sex equivalent
of "the butler did it."

30:46.192 --> 30:48.629
the current living situation
is working.

30:50.674 --> 30:53.895
Are you saying
you want me to go?

30:53.939 --> 30:57.029
I don't know what I'm saying.

30:57.072 --> 31:00.597
I just don't think
this whole thing's working.

Sheila! Sheila! Come on.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.522
What're you doing?

Don't you hear?
They're playing "The Twist."

31:14.437 --> 31:17.223
That's terrific. I'm eating pie.Forget about the pie.

31:17.266 --> 31:20.269
Come on. I want to dance.Well, here's your partner.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.489
She's just like me,
but smaller and stickier.

31:22.532 --> 31:25.100
Come on, honey,
and after we're done dancing,

31:25.144 --> 31:27.059
Daddy's gonna tell you
about all the nice women

31:27.102 --> 31:28.451
he should've married.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.944
You okay there,
Gretchen?[sighs] I broke my heel.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.338
Oh.I'll be right back, Mr. Astaire.

31:45.381 --> 31:47.949
[laughs]You're a killer.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.429
Well, she is.

Mary.

31:52.693 --> 31:54.521
May I have this dance?

31:56.088 --> 31:58.960
Um... No, I don't think so.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.441
Aw, come on.
Don't make me dance alone.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.660
Seriously, I have two left feet.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.967
Well, add them to mine
and we'll have four.

32:08.665 --> 32:11.625
Okay, just for a minute.Yeah, now you're talking.

You can cheat on your wife

[piano resumes playing]Did you see that?

33:28.310 --> 33:29.920
Yeah.

33:29.964 --> 33:32.445
He just grabbed her and pulled
her away in front of everyone.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.360
He was angry that she was
dancing with me.

33:34.403 --> 33:35.535
That's no excuse.

33:35.578 --> 33:36.927
They went into the study.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.538
You need to make sure
he's not hurting her.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.108
Well?

33:43.151 --> 33:46.154
What happens in their marriage
is none of our business.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.304
Is that why we go to parties?

34:05.347 --> 34:07.349
So you can flirt
with strange men?

34:07.393 --> 34:08.655
People can hear you.Or do you

34:08.698 --> 34:11.701
just enjoy humiliating me, huh?

34:15.227 --> 34:18.752
Do you mind?
This is a private conversation.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.672

We'll be out of here in two
shakes of a lamb's tail, okay?

34:40.165 --> 34:43.081
Look, this is not my fault.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.039
She always drinks too much.

34:49.565 --> 34:54.309
I've just set out some angel

34:54.353 --> 34:56.703
Why don't you
go have a slice?

34:58.531 --> 35:02.274
[chuckles] No, thank you.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.060
We're going home.

35:14.329 --> 35:17.680
Maybe you'd like to stay
a little longer?

35:17.724 --> 35:19.682
Give him a chance to cool off.

35:19.726 --> 35:22.642
That'll just make it worse.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.818
Mary.

35:27.212 --> 35:30.693
It must be a wonderful thing

35:30.737 --> 35:33.740
to be strong like you.

35:43.402 --> 35:46.448
That's the reason we became
Southern Baptist.

35:46.492 --> 35:48.494
Those Methodists were just
a little too liberal

35:48.537 --> 35:50.060

Leave the bottle.

don't you, uh,

had enough?

Of you? Yes.

We'll just go shopping

36:12.431 --> 36:14.172
For grease on silk,
you want talcum powder.

36:14.215 --> 36:16.217
There's a travel size
in the rental car.

36:16.261 --> 36:18.263
Okay. Excuse me.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.224
Brad tells us you two run
an art gallery together.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.356
What's that like?

36:24.399 --> 36:25.313
Fun.
Challenging.

36:26.706 --> 36:29.099
It's a challenge,
but a fun one.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.754
Unlike our marriage,
which is purely a challenge.

36:31.798 --> 36:34.235
RUBY:
Speaking of marriage,

36:34.279 --> 36:36.237
I'm just curious, Simone,

36:36.281 --> 36:38.283
how many times
have you been married?

36:38.326 --> 36:40.328
Just three. Why?

36:40.372 --> 36:41.764
It's just an innocent question,
my love.

36:41.808 --> 36:44.245
I wasn't talking to you.I know.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.682
Why are you
so cross with him?

36:46.726 --> 36:49.250
I wasn't cross. Was I cross?

36:49.294 --> 36:50.773
You were
definitely cross.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.253
RUBY:
Um, not that it's

36:52.297 --> 36:54.124
any of my business, but...

36:54.168 --> 36:57.258
if I were twice divorced,
then hooked a man

36:57.302 --> 36:59.217
like Karl,

36:59.260 --> 37:01.262
I'd treat him a little nicer.

37:03.830 --> 37:07.703
Now I'm curious
about something, Ruby.

37:07.747 --> 37:11.446
How would you treat Karl
if you walked into the bathroom

37:11.490 --> 37:13.274
and found him
kissing another man?

37:13.318 --> 37:14.841
Mm.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.804
Bravo, Simone.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.502
That's right, sugar.

37:23.545 --> 37:24.764
Karl is gay.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.374
Still have a
crush on him?

37:26.418 --> 37:28.158
Your stepdad is gay?

37:28.202 --> 37:29.682
I thought he was just English.

37:29.725 --> 37:32.162
That's why
we're getting divorced.

37:32.206 --> 37:33.686
Dear God. Another divorce?

37:33.729 --> 37:35.557
Not really
the headline, Dwight.

37:35.601 --> 37:38.168
Oh, you poor, tragic woman.

37:38.212 --> 37:40.519
I have suffered. It's true.

37:40.562 --> 37:43.261
I-I'm sorry,
do not shed tears for Simone.

37:43.304 --> 37:46.176
She is receiving ample comfort
in the arms

37:46.220 --> 37:47.656

37:47.700 --> 37:48.744
Tommy Harte.

37:48.788 --> 37:49.832
What the fuck?

37:49.876 --> 37:50.790
Shut up, Karl.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.531
You're sleeping with Tommy?

37:52.574 --> 37:55.490
Who, for the newcomers,
is all of 18 years of age.

British homos,

are you marrying into?

Hey. Found the talcum powder.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.631
[chuckles softly]

38:05.674 --> 38:07.894
Why is everyone so serious?

38:10.897 --> 38:13.203
I never thought
I'd see the day our family

38:13.247 --> 38:15.380
would have a homosexual in it.

38:16.555 --> 38:19.209
Brad, you swore
you wouldn't tell.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.820
No, Patty, Patty, I-I...

38:20.863 --> 38:22.430
Oh, I-I don't know
what Brad told you,

38:22.474 --> 38:26.478
but my feelings for you
are sisterly, not sexual.

38:26.521 --> 38:29.219
Oh, sweet suffering Jesus.

Sweet baby,
please say it's not true.

38:37.619 --> 38:40.579
Oh. She's a lesbian.

38:40.622 --> 38:43.495
Mmm. How did I miss that?

38:49.501 --> 38:50.980
Anybody want
an after-dinner cocktail?

38:51.024 --> 38:54.419
Uh, not me. I have
the worst headache.

38:54.462 --> 38:56.334
Why don't you go on upstairs
and lie down?

38:56.377 --> 38:58.336
We can give you
a little space tonight.

38:58.379 --> 39:00.250
That'd be nice.
Thank you.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.520

You want one?

I know what you're talking...

39:20.358 --> 39:22.272
The pills, Eli.

39:22.316 --> 39:25.406
You're an addict
and you let me give you pills.

39:28.017 --> 39:30.498
[sighs]
Shit.

39:32.892 --> 39:35.460
How did you...Taylor told me.

39:35.503 --> 39:39.072
At dinner, in the bathroom.

39:39.115 --> 39:40.508
Shit. She d--

39:40.552 --> 39:41.988
she doesn't know that I took
anything, though, right?

39:42.031 --> 39:43.946
No.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.992
Oh, thank Christ.Not yet.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.865
No. No. No, no, no, no, no.

39:49.909 --> 39:51.911
What do you mean, "No"?

39:51.954 --> 39:55.131
I have to. This is too big.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.395
Fuck.

39:57.438 --> 40:00.180
[exhales]:
What am I gonna do?

40:00.223 --> 40:01.877
I mean,
she's already questioning

40:01.921 --> 40:03.313
our living arrangement.

40:03.357 --> 40:05.315
If she finds out about this,
it doesn't matter

40:05.359 --> 40:09.058
how she feels about me.
I am out on the street.

40:09.102 --> 40:11.409
I don't have
anywhere to go, Eli.

40:11.452 --> 40:14.281
And Willow and Mischa are gone
and Duke is still out there.Listen.

40:14.324 --> 40:16.152
And I...Jade, Jade, listen-listen to me.

40:16.196 --> 40:19.547
That's not gonna happen. Okay?
I'm not gonna let that happen.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.288
I need you here.Why?

40:21.331 --> 40:23.333
Because I'm your muse or am I,
am I just your dealer?

with the pills. Okay?

40:26.119 --> 40:28.382
Done.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.905
So she doesn't need to know.

40:29.949 --> 40:32.430
In that case, give them to me.

40:32.473 --> 40:35.041
What?If you're done
with them,

40:35.084 --> 40:37.173
then there's no reason
that you can't give them back.

40:37.217 --> 40:39.175
So?

40:39.219 --> 40:42.135
Look, the thing is, one of
the producers who's interested

40:42.178 --> 40:43.441
wants a rewrite.I knew it.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.616
[stammers] She's got
some really great ideas.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.139
Lamar says if I can
turn out a draft

40:46.182 --> 40:47.357
by Friday...Eli.

40:47.401 --> 40:48.489
[whispers]:
J-- All right, fine.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.448
Jesus, just take them....

[sighs]

40:56.628 --> 40:59.935
Just, I'm-I'm-I'm so,
I'm so, so close

40:59.979 --> 41:01.589
to getting my career back.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.983
You can handle
a few rewrites without them.

41:04.026 --> 41:05.375
[chuckles]

41:05.419 --> 41:08.117
Yeah, all I know
is that I used to be a writer

41:08.161 --> 41:10.293
and an addict,
and then I got clean,

41:10.337 --> 41:12.470
and all of a sudden,
I wasn't a writer anymore.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.342
But if I can do this,

41:15.385 --> 41:16.952
if I can, if I can
finish this thing

41:16.996 --> 41:18.345
and if I can get it
to them on time,

41:18.388 --> 41:19.564
then, you know, I'm...[claps hands]

41:19.607 --> 41:21.304
[grunts]
I'm back.

41:21.348 --> 41:22.480
I will be legit again,

41:22.523 --> 41:24.090
they will
trust me again

41:24.133 --> 41:25.483
and the money
that will follow, Jade...

41:28.007 --> 41:30.400
...I can take care of you.

41:33.099 --> 41:34.622
Please.

41:36.624 --> 41:38.191
I need them.

41:55.164 --> 41:58.167
And you promise
you'll take care of me?

42:01.693 --> 42:03.695
I promise.

42:15.402 --> 42:17.056
[exhales]

42:19.101 --> 42:22.104
Let's get to work on your movie.

42:31.679 --> 42:33.638
Christ, what an evening.

42:33.681 --> 42:36.031
I'm exhausted.

42:36.075 --> 42:37.772
Oh, you're not
staying here tonight.

42:39.121 --> 42:41.689
Is that so?

42:41.733 --> 42:44.692
I want you to pack your
things and leave, now.

42:44.736 --> 42:46.564
Oh, knock it off, Simone.

42:46.607 --> 42:48.348
I'm angry enough as it is.

42:48.391 --> 42:51.307
You're angry? My daughter
may never speak to me again.

42:51.351 --> 42:53.179
Oh, and whose fault is that?

42:53.222 --> 42:56.748
If you'd just kept your mouth
shut instead of humiliating me.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.706
I was provoked.

42:58.750 --> 43:02.101
Oh, so there was no possible way
you could suppress the impulse

43:02.144 --> 43:04.059
to blow up the entire evening?

43:04.103 --> 43:06.061
Says the man
who couldn't stop himself

43:06.105 --> 43:08.586
from sneaking off
to the men's room for a quickie.

43:08.629 --> 43:09.717
Oh, fuck you!

43:12.198 --> 43:15.767
I've spent my whole damn life
controlling myself,

43:15.810 --> 43:18.160
hiding the central fact
of my existence

43:18.204 --> 43:21.686
so I wouldn't disappoint my
family, my friends or my wife.

43:21.729 --> 43:24.079
Hector was
the only person

43:24.123 --> 43:25.690
who ever saw me
for the man I truly am,

43:25.733 --> 43:28.301
not the one
I was pretending to be.

43:30.303 --> 43:32.610
You have no idea
what he meant to me.

43:32.653 --> 43:36.309
Stop romanticizing
your grubby little fling.

43:36.352 --> 43:37.745
I loved him!

43:37.789 --> 43:40.705
He asked me
to run away with him.

43:40.748 --> 43:45.231
Um, but I-I had made
a commitment to you,

43:45.274 --> 43:47.450
so I chose to stay.

43:50.149 --> 43:52.630
I am your wife.

43:52.673 --> 43:55.633
Am I supposed to be grateful
that you didn't walk out?

43:55.676 --> 43:59.637
I just want you to see it
from my perspective for once.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.639
Just think

44:01.682 --> 44:04.685
about what it may have cost me
to honor the vow I made to you.

44:04.729 --> 44:07.514
So no, Simone,
I do not expect you

44:07.557 --> 44:09.690
to be grateful
for the sacrifice I made,

44:09.734 --> 44:13.476
but for fuck's sake,
at least acknowledge it.

44:15.870 --> 44:18.481
I am going to bed.

44:18.525 --> 44:20.483
Not in the guest room.

44:20.527 --> 44:23.486
In our room, in our bed.

44:23.530 --> 44:25.619
You sleep
where you like.

44:47.206 --> 44:49.295
The Thompsons just left.

44:49.338 --> 44:51.340
Said to thank you
for a lovely time.

44:56.215 --> 44:58.696
So, you're not talking to me.

44:58.739 --> 45:01.742
What am I
supposed to say?

45:01.786 --> 45:04.527
It was a party.

45:04.571 --> 45:07.530
I wasn't gonna cause a scene.

45:07.574 --> 45:11.752
He hurt her,
right in front of you,

45:11.796 --> 45:13.754
and you did nothing.

45:13.798 --> 45:16.452
What was I supposed to do?
Hit him?

45:16.496 --> 45:19.629
I mean, I'm sure our guests
would have loved that.

45:19.673 --> 45:21.457
You could have at
least confronted him.

45:21.501 --> 45:24.286
Reminded him that kind of
behavior is unacceptable.

45:24.330 --> 45:25.766
The guy had been drinking.

45:25.810 --> 45:28.116
I-I'm sure he didn't mean
to hurt her.

45:28.160 --> 45:31.467
This is not the first time
he's gotten rough with her.

45:31.511 --> 45:33.426
How do you know that?

45:34.644 --> 45:37.125
She had several bruises
on her arm.

45:37.169 --> 45:40.433
That's why she's wearing
long sleeves on such a hot day.

45:40.476 --> 45:43.305
If it's that bad, why
doesn't she leave him?

45:43.349 --> 45:45.655
And where would
she go, Rob? Here?

45:45.699 --> 45:47.657
Will you let her
sleep on our sofa?

45:47.701 --> 45:50.312
Jesus, Beth Ann, I don't know.

45:50.356 --> 45:52.314
And what if Ralph comes
banging on our door

45:52.358 --> 45:54.316
in the middle of the night
to try to drag her back?

45:54.360 --> 45:57.319
Would you have the balls
to stand up to him then?

45:57.363 --> 45:58.712
Don't use that kind of language.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.366
Of course you wouldn't.
You would just slink away

46:00.409 --> 46:01.715
like the coward you are!

46:01.759 --> 46:03.717
Okay!

46:05.545 --> 46:07.503
He's not
the perfect husband.

46:07.547 --> 46:10.289
It's not my job to judge him!

46:10.332 --> 46:12.552
Would you like the neighbors
coming in here and judging you

46:12.595 --> 46:14.380
for not being
the perfect mother?

46:14.423 --> 46:16.425
Huh?!

46:22.388 --> 46:25.870
I'm just saying,
leave it alone.

46:43.888 --> 46:47.369
[exhales] I didn't know
you were still here.

46:47.413 --> 46:48.849
I was just upstairs.

46:48.893 --> 46:52.374
Just... picking up some trash.

46:52.418 --> 46:54.855
So you heard everything?

46:54.899 --> 46:57.640
Yeah.

46:57.684 --> 47:00.513
What was that all about?

47:02.950 --> 47:04.734
Honey.

47:04.778 --> 47:07.737
It's okay.

47:07.781 --> 47:10.436
You can talk to me.

47:10.479 --> 47:15.267
Whatever it is, I don't judge.

47:24.276 --> 47:28.454
Our daughter died because of me.

47:31.500 --> 47:34.982
I'm the one who's responsible.

47:39.334 --> 47:41.336
[doorbell rings]

47:44.992 --> 47:47.690
Simone.

47:47.734 --> 47:49.431
What are you doing here?

47:49.475 --> 47:53.000
I need to know. Do you love him?

47:55.785 --> 47:57.787
I do.

47:59.833 --> 48:02.444
Okay, then invite me in.

48:02.488 --> 48:04.838
We have a lot to talk about.
