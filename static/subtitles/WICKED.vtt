So if there are no further questions,
I'm gonna go.

00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:22.224
Glinda,

00:12:22.225 --> 00:12:24.226
is it true you were her friend?

00:12:24.227 --> 00:12:25.811
What?

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:28.440
Sorry. One sec. [clears throat]

00:12:29.232 --> 00:12:30.067
What?

00:12:30.692 --> 00:12:32.943
Is it true you were her friend?

00:12:32.944 --> 00:12:34.404
[Ozians clamor, gasp]

00:12:36.698 --> 00:12:37.699
Friend?

00:12:40.786 --> 00:12:42.662
- Yes.
- [Ozians gasp]

00:12:42.663 --> 00:12:45.332
I-I mean, I did know her. [chuckles]

00:12:47.084 --> 00:12:48.168
That is,

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:51.171
our paths did cross.

00:13:02.265 --> 00:13:04.726
- At school.
- [Ozians gasping, whispering]

00:13:07.854 --> 00:13:09.189
[Glinda] <i>But you must understand,</i>

00:13:09.856 --> 00:13:11.066
<i>it was a long time ago.</i>

00:13:45.767 --> 00:13:46.601
[gasps]

00:13:49.187 --> 00:13:50.772
[students laughing]

00:13:54.693 --> 00:13:56.695
[students laughing, chattering]

00:14:00.324 --> 00:14:01.157
[Galinda] Hi.

00:14:01.158 --> 00:14:02.241
Oh, it's Galinda.

00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:04.202
- Hi! Galinda!
- [Galinda shrieks]

00:14:04.995 --> 00:14:06.787
{\an8}[Galinda's father]
Oh, we're so proud of you!

00:14:06.788 --> 00:14:09.540
Thank you. I love you. Just remember,

00:14:09.541 --> 00:14:11.917
- it's not goodbye, it's farewell.
- We love you.

00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:13.127
- You have all your cases?
- Yes.

00:14:13.128 --> 00:14:14.462
- And you will write?
- Yes.

00:14:14.463 --> 00:14:16.630
- I love you. It's that time.
- [Galinda's mother] My darling.

00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:17.548
[Galinda] Miss you already.

00:14:17.549 --> 00:14:19.633
- [Galinda's mother sighs]
- Popsicle, board the boat.

00:14:19.634 --> 00:14:22.011
They are gonna miss me so much. [chuckles]

00:14:22.012 --> 00:14:24.722
My parents don't even know I left.
[chuckles]

00:14:24.723 --> 00:14:27.224
Uh... Uh... [sighs]

00:14:27.225 --> 00:14:28.143
I'm Boq.

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:30.603
I'm from Munchkinland.

00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:31.896
[Galinda chuckles]

00:14:31.897 --> 00:14:34.231
I know we don't really know
each other yet...

00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:36.109
- You know what I believe, Bick?
- ...but...

00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:38.153
It's Bick... It's Boq.

00:14:38.695 --> 00:14:40.238
That strangers...

00:14:40.906 --> 00:14:42.532
are just people I've never met.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.869
[chuckles]

00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:47.454

No, I am not seasick.

00:16:01.111 --> 00:16:04.780
No, I did not eat grass as a child.

00:16:04.781 --> 00:16:06.241
And, yes,

00:16:06.742 --> 00:16:08.327
I've always been green.

00:16:09.494 --> 00:16:10.495
Well,

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.291
I, for one, am so sorry

00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:18.003
that you have been forced to live with...

00:16:19.421 --> 00:16:20.421
this.

00:16:20.422 --> 00:16:21.505
Is that so?

00:16:21.506 --> 00:16:22.591
Yes.

00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:26.218
And it is my intention

00:16:26.219 --> 00:16:28.137
- to major in sorcery.
- [sighs]

00:16:28.138 --> 00:16:32.059
So, if at some point,
you wanted to address the, um...

00:16:33.852 --> 00:16:34.853
problem.

00:16:35.604 --> 00:16:36.605
Problem.

00:16:37.314 --> 00:16:38.481
Perhaps I could help.

00:16:38.482 --> 00:16:40.149
[students] Oh. [cheering]

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.487
- She's so good. She's so good.
- You're so good. We love you.

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:48.116
- [students gasping, laughing]
- [Galinda] Thank you.

00:16:50.952 --> 00:16:52.620
All right. [clears throat]

00:16:52.621 --> 00:16:55.164
Offering to help someone
that you don't know

00:16:55.165 --> 00:16:56.792
with skills that you don't have.

00:16:57.459 --> 00:16:59.877
I'm sure everyone is duly impressed.

00:16:59.878 --> 00:17:01.712
I could care less what others think.

00:17:01.713 --> 00:17:03.631
- Couldn't.
- What?

00:17:03.632 --> 00:17:06.218
You "couldn't" care less
what other people think.

00:17:06.718 --> 00:17:07.719
Though, I...

00:17:08.303 --> 00:17:09.304
I doubt that.

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:11.097
[Governor] Elphaba.

00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:13.016
- [students murmuring]
- Elphaba Thropp.

00:17:14.517 --> 00:17:16.727
Ah. This is my younger sister, Nessarose.

00:17:16.728 --> 00:17:19.147
As you can see,
she's a perfectly acceptable color.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.070
- [Galinda] Oh, my God.
- Stop making a spectacle of yourself.

00:17:25.696 --> 00:17:26.904
I was trying to be nice.

00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:29.031
- You were so nice and good and correct.
- Did I do something bad?

00:17:29.032 --> 00:17:29.949
- I was...
- No.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.160
- [Galinda] How did that come across?
- [Pfannee] I don't see color, but...

00:17:33.829 --> 00:17:34.912
My precious little girl.

00:17:34.913 --> 00:17:36.373
[chuckling] Father.

00:17:38.417 --> 00:17:39.960
A parting gift.

00:17:45.716 --> 00:17:47.801
Mother's jeweled shoes.

00:17:48.468 --> 00:17:54.098
So they can all see how beautiful you are
right down to your toes.

00:17:54.099 --> 00:17:55.684
[Nessarose] Thank you.

00:17:56.518 --> 00:17:58.728
Thank you so much. I love them.

00:17:58.729 --> 00:18:00.563
[Governor]
Let me put them with your boxes.

00:18:00.564 --> 00:18:02.315
Of course. [sighs]

00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:07.404
I shouldn't have sprouted off like that.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.614
No, you shouldn't have.

00:18:10.615 --> 00:18:12.366
[sighs]

00:18:12.367 --> 00:18:13.451
Today is...

00:18:13.452 --> 00:18:15.245
The start of your new life.

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:18.707
- New friends.
- [chuckles]

00:18:19.207 --> 00:18:20.876
- New books.
- [chuckles]

00:18:22.753 --> 00:18:24.295
I'm excited for you.

00:18:24.296 --> 00:18:25.629
I'll miss you.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.382
[chuckles] No, you won't.

00:18:28.008 --> 00:18:29.383
You'll be having too good a time.

00:18:29.384 --> 00:18:30.469
[chuckles]

00:18:31.845 --> 00:18:35.056

<i>please report to the quad.</i>

00:18:38.518 --> 00:18:40.020
- Don't help her.
- Don't help me.

00:18:43.482 --> 00:18:44.733
She'll be fine.

00:18:45.984 --> 00:18:50.572

- Hi. Nice to meet you too.

00:18:58.497 --> 00:18:59.580
[Elphaba] We should head back.

00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:01.791
- Go with her.
- What?

00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:04.126
Just until she's safely settled
in her room.

00:19:04.127 --> 00:19:07.046
Make sure she has everything she needs.

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:08.422
Father, she's on her own now.

00:19:08.423 --> 00:19:09.924
- I can't just...
- Just stop jabbering.

00:19:09.925 --> 00:19:11.385
Just do what I say.

00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:13.636
[student laughs]

00:19:13.637 --> 00:19:16.014

00:19:25.524 --> 00:19:26.399

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.318
[Shiz president] Thank you
for your contribution to our university.

00:19:29.319 --> 00:19:34.407
And rounding out the rest of our faculty,
we have two scholars

00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:39.662
eminent in their respective fields
of forestry and agriculture...

00:19:39.663 --> 00:19:41.080
[students applaud]

00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:44.458
...as well as Professor Mombi
of the Biological Arts,

00:19:44.459 --> 00:19:48.463
and, of course, the head of our
History department, Dr. Dillamond.

00:19:49.047 --> 00:19:50.965
[scattered applause]

00:19:50.966 --> 00:19:54.260
[Shiz president] You know,
except for our wonderful Wizard,

00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:57.263
true magic has become all too rare,

00:19:57.264 --> 00:20:03.561
which is why we are privileged to have
our esteemed Dean of Sorcery Studies,

00:20:03.562 --> 00:20:05.146
Madame Morrible.

00:20:05.147 --> 00:20:07.149

Oh.

00:20:22.205 --> 00:20:23.206
Could you...

00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.375
[chuckling] I don't...

00:20:26.376 --> 00:20:28.711
Oh, my goodness.
It's really her. [exclaims]

00:20:28.712 --> 00:20:30.797

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:36.511

00:20:37.763 --> 00:20:39.597
Welcome, new students.

00:20:39.598 --> 00:20:43.643
And congratulotions
for having been accepted to Shiz.

00:20:44.394 --> 00:20:48.774
Whether you'll be studying law,
logic or linguification,

00:20:49.358 --> 00:20:52.778
I know I speak for
my fellow faculty members

00:20:53.528 --> 00:20:59.241
when I say we have
nothing but the highest hopes

00:20:59.242 --> 00:21:01.285
for some of you.

00:21:01.286 --> 00:21:03.372
[students chuckling]

00:21:03.997 --> 00:21:06.916
And now, Miss Coddle, if you please.

00:21:06.917 --> 00:21:10.795
I am Miss Coddle, Head Shizstress.

00:21:10.796 --> 00:21:14.966
And these are your dormitory designations
and room assignments.

00:21:17.427 --> 00:21:20.971
{\an8}Good luck, and welcome to Shiz.

00:21:20.972 --> 00:21:22.516
[cheering]

00:21:31.942 --> 00:21:33.401
Madame Morrible, hi.

00:21:33.402 --> 00:21:38.030
I am Galinda Upland, of the Upper Uplands.

00:21:38.031 --> 00:21:40.324
If this is regarding room assignments...

00:21:40.325 --> 00:21:43.619
Oh, thank you so much, but I've already
been assigned a private suite.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.414
This is about my application
to your sorcery seminar.

00:21:46.415 --> 00:21:50.876
Perhaps you recall my essay,
"Magic Wands, need they have a point?"

00:21:50.877 --> 00:21:54.797
Well, dear,
I don't teach my seminar every semester.

00:21:54.798 --> 00:21:58.426
Of course, if someone very special
were to come along...

00:21:58.427 --> 00:22:01.763
[chuckles] Exactly.
This is why I wanted to talk to you. Um...

00:22:02.764 --> 00:22:04.016
We'll be in touch.

00:22:05.058 --> 00:22:07.811
There you are. [laughs, kisses]

00:22:08.311 --> 00:22:10.021
- Miss Nessarose, isn't it?
- Yes.

00:22:10.022 --> 00:22:11.397
- The Governor's daughter?
- Mm-hmm.

00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:15.736
[sighs] How tragically beautiful you are.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.822
It is such an honor to... [gasps]

00:22:20.115 --> 00:22:21.324
I'm the other daughter.

00:22:21.325 --> 00:22:23.034
I'm beautifully tragic.

00:22:23.035 --> 00:22:25.661
The other daughter?

00:22:25.662 --> 00:22:27.830
Elphaba. What are you doing?

00:22:27.831 --> 00:22:31.083
Well... [stammers] ...I wasn't made aware.
[clears throat]

00:22:31.084 --> 00:22:33.419
- I know. I was just...
- Not to fret.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.672
Just a slight gulch. [chuckles]

00:22:36.757 --> 00:22:39.258
We'll find some place to hide you.

00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:42.012
I mean, house you.

00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:44.805
That won't be necessary.

00:22:44.806 --> 00:22:46.767
- I'm not enrolled.
- [sighing] Oh, good.

00:22:47.392 --> 00:22:48.559
Why are you still here?

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.102
I'm sorry, Nessa. Father insisted...

00:22:50.103 --> 00:22:52.813
Oh, the Governor made his concern
for your sister quite apparent.

00:22:52.814 --> 00:22:53.731
Wait.

00:22:53.732 --> 00:22:56.442

- Of course.

00:25:16.541 --> 00:25:17.834
Not you.

- Get her.

00:25:50.867 --> 00:25:52.243
- Go, go, go.
- Just get her.

00:25:52.244 --> 00:25:53.911
- [Galinda] How?
- We need a pastry.

00:25:53.912 --> 00:25:54.997
We need a pastry.

00:25:55.247 --> 00:25:56.998
[Elphaba] Thank you for covering for me.

00:25:56.999 --> 00:25:59.458
And I'm humbled by your munificent offer,

00:25:59.459 --> 00:26:01.252
but my father would never allow it.

00:26:01.253 --> 00:26:04.756
Leave your father to me.
I'll speak to him immediately.

00:26:05.257 --> 00:26:09.511
So, how long have you had this talent?

Something I can't control.

00:26:21.648 --> 00:26:22.649
And when it does,

I don't see what the problem is.

You know, every other professor
manages to pronouncify my name.

00:39:56.046 --> 00:39:58.297
Maybe the pronuncifi-cation
of your precious name

is not the sole focus

00:40:00.884 --> 00:40:04.054

is not like every other professor.

00:40:04.554 --> 00:40:07.057

Now, you may have noticed that I am one of
the last animal professors here at Shiz.

00:40:40.632 --> 00:40:45.177
And it isn't encouraged
to discuss this in our classes,

00:40:45.178 --> 00:40:48.347
but there have been some great changes
throughout Oz

00:40:48.348 --> 00:40:51.059
with the rejection of animal culture.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.855
However, there was a time,
before you were born,

00:40:55.397 --> 00:40:58.066
when life in Oz was different.

00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:02.069

our present circumstances.

That my sister is the way she is.

When my mother was carrying Nessa,

So...

- Do you need my help?

01:24:44.818 --> 01:24:47.029
No! Just wear the "froat." It's pretty.

01:24:54.453 --> 01:24:55.579

- Thank you.

01:24:58.290 --> 01:24:59.958
[gasps] Oh.

01:25:01.126 --> 01:25:02.127
Maybe...

01:25:03.837 --> 01:25:05.255
just this.

Pink goes good with green.

01:25:12.554 --> 01:25:14.013
Goes "well" with green.

01:25:14.014 --> 01:25:16.058
- [chuckles] It so does.
- [chuckles]

01:25:32.115 --> 01:25:33.617
Why, Miss Elphaba...

You can't permit this.

Miss Elphaba,
I'm afraid it's out of our hands.

[Dr. Dillamond] They can take away my job,

01:28:45.934 --> 01:28:48.436
- but I shall continue speaking out!
- Dr. Dillamond.

01:28:48.437 --> 01:28:52.523

Are you all right?

01:29:27.434 --> 01:29:31.813
...your new history professor
has prepared a special presentation.

01:29:47.954 --> 01:29:50.499
Good afternoon, students.

01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:56.087
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:29:56.088 --> 01:29:57.838
In times such as these,

01:29:57.839 --> 01:30:02.343
it behooves us all
not merely to study the past,

01:30:02.344 --> 01:30:05.263
but to look to the future.

01:30:06.515 --> 01:30:07.765
[cub meows]

01:30:07.766 --> 01:30:09.183
[students murmuring]

01:30:09.184 --> 01:30:12.938
This is called a cage.

01:30:14.648 --> 01:30:16.066
[growls]

01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:21.862
This remarkable innovation
is for the good of all Oz,

01:30:21.863 --> 01:30:24.323
as well as for the animal's own good.
You see...

01:30:24.324 --> 01:30:26.410
If it's so good, why is he trembling?

01:30:27.536 --> 01:30:28.996

01:30:31.206 --> 01:30:33.291
He's just happy to be here.

01:30:35.043 --> 01:30:37.878
Now, one benefit
of caging an animal this young

01:30:37.879 --> 01:30:40.799
is that in all likelihood,
he'll never learn to speak.

01:30:41.425 --> 01:30:42.425
Oh, no.

01:30:42.426 --> 01:30:45.302
[professor] The dimensions of the cage
will vary upon the size of the animal,

01:30:45.303 --> 01:30:47.638
but the basic design remains the same.

01:30:47.639 --> 01:30:49.348
Let me show you.

01:30:52.394 --> 01:30:54.812
Can you imagine a world
where animals are kept in cages

01:30:54.813 --> 01:30:56.480
and they never learn to speak?

01:30:56.481 --> 01:30:58.191
This poor lion cub seems so frightened.

01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:00.067
What are we gonna do?

01:31:00.068 --> 01:31:01.736
Sorry, "we"?

01:31:01.737 --> 01:31:04.656
- Well, someone's got to do something.

I don't know. I got mad and...

01:31:47.282 --> 01:31:48.867
Fiyero, what are you doing?

01:31:50.786 --> 01:31:52.621
Well, you coming?

01:31:53.413 --> 01:31:54.539
Come on.

01:31:59.670 --> 01:32:00.670
Look.

01:32:00.671 --> 01:32:01.755
Come on.

01:32:03.674 --> 01:32:05.342
Come, buddy. That's it.

01:32:05.967 --> 01:32:08.595
- There we go. There we go.
- Yeah. All right.

01:32:33.495 --> 01:32:34.788
What in the name of Oz?

01:33:11.575 --> 01:33:13.368
[Elphaba] I didn't mean to scare you.

01:33:15.704 --> 01:33:18.539
Why is it you're always causing
some sort of commotion?

01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.708
I don't cause commotions. I am one.

01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:22.752
Yeah. Well, that's for sure.

01:33:22.753 --> 01:33:25.838
So, you think I should just keep my
mouth shut? Is that what you're saying?

01:33:25.839 --> 01:33:27.381
What? No. No, I'm saying...

01:33:27.382 --> 01:33:29.175
- You think I wanna be this way?
- I...

01:33:29.176 --> 01:33:31.385
- You think I wanna care this much?
- No, I mean...

01:33:31.386 --> 01:33:33.429
I know my life would be much easier
if I didn't care, but...

01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:35.265
Do you ever let anyone else talk?

01:33:37.559 --> 01:33:38.560
Sorry.

01:33:40.354 --> 01:33:42.272
- I was just...
- But can I just say one more thing?

01:33:44.191 --> 01:33:46.026
You could've walked away back there.

01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:47.610
So?

01:33:47.611 --> 01:33:50.988
So no matter how shallow and self-absorbed
you pretend to be...

01:33:50.989 --> 01:33:53.157
Uh, excuse me. There is no pretense here.

01:33:53.158 --> 01:33:55.326
I happen to be genuinely self-absorbed
and deeply shallow.

01:33:55.327 --> 01:33:57.370
Oh, please. No, you're not.

01:33:57.371 --> 01:33:59.122
Otherwise, you wouldn't be so unhappy.

01:34:08.632 --> 01:34:09.633

What did you mean to do back there?

01:35:06.815 --> 01:35:09.067
And why was I the only one
you didn't do it to?

01:35:15.741 --> 01:35:16.742
You're bleeding.

There.

01:35:41.183 --> 01:35:42.975
It must've scratched you.

01:35:42.976 --> 01:35:44.061
Yeah.

01:35:47.397 --> 01:35:49.524
Or maybe it scratched me or something.

01:35:52.819 --> 01:35:53.945
I better get to safety.

This is your chance to make good.

01:41:06.008 --> 01:41:09.260
Of course, you're going to have to
prove yourself first.

01:41:09.261 --> 01:41:10.511
Prove myself?

01:41:10.512 --> 01:41:12.179
Prove yourself worthy.

01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:15.934
Dearie, this is the Wizard of Oz.

01:41:16.727 --> 01:41:18.894
If he's gonna grant your heart's desire...

01:41:18.895 --> 01:41:21.064
But prove myself how? I...

01:41:21.857 --> 01:41:23.691
I'm not ready. It's too soon.

01:41:23.692 --> 01:41:25.443
Don't be so pessi-mystical.

01:41:25.444 --> 01:41:28.780
I, too, had to prove my powers
when I met the Wizard.

01:41:29.364 --> 01:41:32.075
You'll find a way. I have faith in you.

01:41:33.785 --> 01:41:36.246
[thunder rumbling]

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:40.292
Not to fret. Weather is my specialty.

01:41:43.337 --> 01:41:44.838
Mustn't let you get wet.

01:41:45.547 --> 01:41:47.089
[groans] Okay. I'll make a hand umbrella.

01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:49.217
My hair. Thank you.

01:41:57.642 --> 01:42:01.395
- Not when you're on the cusp of greatness.
- [chuckles]

01:42:01.396 --> 01:42:03.230
[students applauding, cheering]

01:42:03.231 --> 01:42:05.150
[train whistle blows]

01:42:30.092 --> 01:42:31.759
[blows whistle]

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.346
All aboard for the Emerald City!

01:42:35.347 --> 01:42:38.057
Father, this is Boq,
the boy I wrote to you about.

01:42:38.058 --> 01:42:42.144
Oh, yes. Governor Thropp,
good to meet you.

01:42:42.145 --> 01:42:44.438
Oh, I've heard so much about you.

01:42:44.439 --> 01:42:47.525
My Nessarose is very precious to me,

01:42:47.526 --> 01:42:50.070
so you see you take good care of her.

01:42:52.364 --> 01:42:53.699
I-I understand.

01:42:54.825 --> 01:42:55.826
Good.

01:42:57.703 --> 01:42:59.078
[Galinda] Elphie!

01:42:59.079 --> 01:43:00.538
Elphie, the train is here.

01:43:00.539 --> 01:43:03.624
And it came with the cutest little man
with a mustache. You gotta see him.

01:43:03.625 --> 01:43:06.378
[chuckles] Oh, Elphie.
How will we manage without you?

01:43:06.962 --> 01:43:08.379
You won't even notice I'm gone.

01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:10.297
- Uh, you have Fiyero.
- Oh.

01:43:10.298 --> 01:43:12.091
[stammers] Um,
speaking of Fiyero, where is he?

01:43:12.092 --> 01:43:14.176
Not that I expected him
to come and say goodbye, but...

01:43:14.177 --> 01:43:16.679
I mean, we barely know each other.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.931
Well, I barely know him anymore either.

01:43:18.932 --> 01:43:20.434
He's been different.

01:43:21.643 --> 01:43:23.645
He's distant and moodified.

01:43:25.230 --> 01:43:26.939
And he's been thinking,

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:29.443
which really worries me.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.194
It all started
the day Dr. Dillamond was fired.

01:43:32.195 --> 01:43:34.822
I mean, who knew he cared so much
about that old goat?

01:43:34.823 --> 01:43:37.491
[gasps] Look. He did come.

01:43:37.492 --> 01:43:38.743
Dearest.

01:43:38.744 --> 01:43:41.830
We're over here, darling. [chuckles] Come.

01:43:42.414 --> 01:43:44.458
Hi. [chuckles]

01:43:45.334 --> 01:43:47.419
- Elphaba.
- Fiyero.

01:43:49.296 --> 01:43:50.464
I'm happy for you.

01:43:51.048 --> 01:43:52.049
Thank you.

01:43:52.674 --> 01:43:55.509
Yes. We are both so happy.

01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:58.888
- I've been thinking...
- Yeah. I heard.

01:43:58.889 --> 01:44:01.850
...about the, uh, the lion cub
and Dr. Dillamond.

01:44:03.769 --> 01:44:05.228
I think about that day a lot.

01:44:06.396 --> 01:44:07.647
So do I.

01:44:14.404 --> 01:44:15.572
Oh, me too.

01:44:16.448 --> 01:44:18.783
Oh, me too. Me too. Mm-hmm.

01:44:18.784 --> 01:44:20.452
I think about it constantly.

01:44:20.952 --> 01:44:22.704
I mean, poor Dr. Dillamond.

01:44:23.622 --> 01:44:25.499
It makes one want to... [sighs]

01:44:27.376 --> 01:44:28.710
...to take a stand.

01:44:30.295 --> 01:44:32.546
In fact, excuse me.

01:44:32.547 --> 01:44:36.218
Everyone. Please, I have an announcement.

01:44:40.681 --> 01:44:42.765
I am changing my name.

01:44:42.766 --> 01:44:43.974
[students gasping]

01:44:43.975 --> 01:44:45.060
- What?
- What?

01:44:45.811 --> 01:44:47.436
- Your name?
- Yes.

01:44:47.437 --> 01:44:49.271
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:44:49.272 --> 01:44:54.110
Since Dr. Dillamond used to have his own
goat-like way of pronouncifying my name,

01:44:54.111 --> 01:44:55.611
in solidarity

01:44:55.612 --> 01:44:59.115
and in order to express my outrage,

01:44:59.116 --> 01:45:02.911
I will henceforward be known
no longer as "Galinda,"

01:45:04.413 --> 01:45:05.580
but simply...

01:45:08.625 --> 01:45:09.750
Glinda.

01:45:09.751 --> 01:45:12.253
- [students cheering, applauding]
- [ShenShen] Clapping!

01:45:12.254 --> 01:45:14.422
- She's so good.
- Oh. She so is.

01:45:14.423 --> 01:45:16.591
Such braverism.

01:45:19.469 --> 01:45:20.303
Glinda!

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:25.182
[Pfannee] Galinda no more,
Glinda henceforth!

01:45:25.183 --> 01:45:27.019
[Boq] Glinda, you're wonderful!

01:45:29.563 --> 01:45:30.564
Glinda!

01:45:44.536 --> 01:45:45.704
Good luck.

01:45:49.666 --> 01:45:51.501
[train whistle blows]

01:45:53.170 --> 01:45:55.088
See? There.

01:45:56.006 --> 01:45:57.340
[stammers] What is that?

01:45:57.341 --> 01:45:58.424
Don't be upset, Galinda.

01:45:58.425 --> 01:46:01.344
It's "Glinda" now. Stupid.
I don't even know what made me say it.

01:46:01.345 --> 01:46:02.720
It doesn't even matter what your name is.

01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:04.972
- Everyone loves you.
- I don't care.

01:46:04.973 --> 01:46:06.224
I want him.

01:46:07.392 --> 01:46:09.978
I don't even think he's perfect anymore,
and I still want him.

01:46:10.771 --> 01:46:12.856
This must be what other people feel like.

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.567
- How do they bear it?
- [chuckles]

01:46:16.610 --> 01:46:19.862
[conductor]
All aboard for the Emerald City!

01:46:19.863 --> 01:46:21.781
- The mustache man.
- [students cheering]

01:46:21.782 --> 01:46:23.617
Hey, come on. The train.

01:46:26.912 --> 01:46:27.913
Thank you.

01:46:34.086 --> 01:46:35.921
Yes! We love you!

01:46:49.726 --> 01:46:52.020
- [conductor] Stand clear of the doors!
- Goodbye!

01:46:57.150 --> 01:46:59.276
[gasps] Oh. Wait.

01:46:59.277 --> 01:47:00.946
Oh, excuse me. Um...

01:47:01.571 --> 01:47:04.616
Elphie, here.
I forgot to give you this. Oh.

01:47:06.076 --> 01:47:07.285
Bye.

01:47:16.211 --> 01:47:18.129
- Come with me.
- What?

01:47:18.130 --> 01:47:19.213
To meet the Wizard.

01:47:19.214 --> 01:47:20.756
What are you saying?

01:47:20.757 --> 01:47:22.842
Get on the train. You're gonna miss it.

01:47:22.843 --> 01:47:24.135
I wouldn't want to impose.

01:47:24.136 --> 01:47:25.928
It doesn't matter. Just come with me.

01:47:25.929 --> 01:47:28.305
I couldn't possibly. This is your moment.
I'm coming.

- Huh.

if you can't decipher it.

02:06:15.183 --> 02:06:19.186
Dearie, I, myself,
can only read a word or two,

02:06:19.187 --> 02:06:20.938
and that took years.

02:06:20.939 --> 02:06:24.026
[speaking the Grimmerie language]

02:06:26.611 --> 02:06:28.280
- Oh, Elphie.
- Praise Oz.

02:06:30.991 --> 02:06:32.034
[growling]

02:06:32.659 --> 02:06:34.995
[speaking the Grimmerie language]

02:06:47.924 --> 02:06:49.092
What did I tell you?

02:07:01.521 --> 02:07:03.023
- [growls]
- [gasps]

02:07:03.607 --> 02:07:04.857
Chistery, are you all right?

02:07:04.858 --> 02:07:06.652
- [roars]
- [Elphaba] Chistery?

02:07:07.819 --> 02:07:09.154
- [growls]
- [yelps]

02:07:09.988 --> 02:07:11.906
It's just the transition, dearie.

02:07:11.907 --> 02:07:13.617
It's just the transition.

02:07:14.701 --> 02:07:16.161
[growling, hooting]

02:07:17.287 --> 02:07:18.413
[whimpering]

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:25.379
Oh.

02:07:26.380 --> 02:07:28.090
[chittering, growling]

02:07:28.965 --> 02:07:30.300
But it's hurting him.

02:07:31.468 --> 02:07:32.343
Chistery.

02:07:32.344 --> 02:07:33.929
Don't bite. Don't bite.

02:07:38.392 --> 02:07:39.810
[growling, roaring]

02:08:04.126 --> 02:08:05.501
Glory-osky.

02:08:05.502 --> 02:08:08.588
You did it. [gasps] You actually did it.

02:08:12.926 --> 02:08:14.094
[gasps]

02:08:14.636 --> 02:08:16.013
[grunting]

02:08:19.641 --> 02:08:20.975
He's in pain.

02:08:20.976 --> 02:08:22.560
Quick. How do I reverse it?

02:08:22.561 --> 02:08:24.603
- Reverse...
- How do I reverse it?

02:08:24.604 --> 02:08:27.232
A spell from the Grimmerie
can never be reversed.

02:08:31.653 --> 02:08:34.322
- [screeching, growling]
- Elphaba. Elphaba.

02:08:34.323 --> 02:08:35.782
No. No!

02:08:38.118 --> 02:08:39.411
[chittering, growling]

02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:52.090
[gasps, chuckles]

02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:56.302
I knew she had the power. I told you.

02:08:56.303 --> 02:08:58.054
Elphie, this is astoundifying.

02:08:58.055 --> 02:09:00.389
It's just what we hoped for.
Eyes in the skies.

02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:03.601
Yes. They'll make perfect spies.

02:09:03.602 --> 02:09:04.686
Spies?

02:09:06.521 --> 02:09:08.898
- Elphaba? Elphaba?
- Oh, uh, no. No. Uh...

02:09:08.899 --> 02:09:11.276
[Glinda] Elphie? Elphie?

02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:14.695
You're right. That's a very harsh word.

02:09:14.696 --> 02:09:17.573
Oh, "scouts." What about "scouts"?
Because they're gonna be flying around Oz

02:09:17.574 --> 02:09:19.408
reporting back
on any seditious animal activity...

02:09:19.409 --> 02:09:21.285
Seditious animal activity?
What does that mean?

02:09:21.286 --> 02:09:24.331
Elphie. I'm sure the Wizard
has a good reason.

02:09:29.002 --> 02:09:30.128
It's you.

02:09:31.588 --> 02:09:32.923
You're behind all of this.

02:09:34.341 --> 02:09:36.717
You're the reason why
people are turning against the animals.

02:09:36.718 --> 02:09:38.095
You... It's all because of you.

02:09:39.763 --> 02:09:41.555
We're doing this to keep people safe.

02:09:41.556 --> 02:09:43.558
All of Oz will benefit.

02:09:44.142 --> 02:09:45.227
And you've known all along.

02:09:46.937 --> 02:09:48.397
Since the day you met me.

02:09:48.980 --> 02:09:51.649
You will benefit too, dearie.

02:09:51.650 --> 02:09:53.901
- You must trust me.
- Don't. Don't.

02:09:53.902 --> 02:09:55.403
El-Elphaba.

02:09:55.404 --> 02:09:58.948
When I first got here, well,
there was discord.

02:09:58.949 --> 02:10:00.241
There was discontent.

02:10:00.242 --> 02:10:02.326
And back where I come from,

02:10:02.327 --> 02:10:06.832
everybody knows that the best way
to bring folks together

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:10.961
is to give them a... a real good enemy.

02:10:11.962 --> 02:10:14.547
If you wanted s-spies,
why wouldn't you just...

02:10:14.548 --> 02:10:16.591
why wouldn't you just
make them yourself? You... [sighs]

02:10:25.767 --> 02:10:26.852
Elphaba.

02:10:27.769 --> 02:10:28.854
Elphaba.

02:10:29.604 --> 02:10:31.815
You are talking to the Wizard of Oz.

02:10:34.401 --> 02:10:35.318
- Read it.
- [grunts]

02:10:35.319 --> 02:10:37.361
- [gasps]
- [Elphaba] Cast a spell.

02:10:37.362 --> 02:10:39.238
Read it!

02:10:39.239 --> 02:10:40.657
- Elphaba.
- Don't...

02:10:45.454 --> 02:10:47.080
You can't, can you?

02:10:49.416 --> 02:10:50.751
Can you?

02:10:55.797 --> 02:10:57.506
[breathes heavily]

02:10:57.507 --> 02:10:59.133
That's why you need all of this.

02:10:59.134 --> 02:11:02.928
And you need spies
and-and animals in cages and an enemy.

02:11:02.929 --> 02:11:04.388
You...

02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:05.974
You have no real power.

02:11:06.767 --> 02:11:08.476
Exactly.

02:11:08.477 --> 02:11:10.019
That's why I need you.

02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:14.065
Think of your future, dearie.

02:11:14.066 --> 02:11:15.359
- Stay back.
- [gasps]

02:11:16.276 --> 02:11:17.277
[grunts]

02:11:18.111 --> 02:11:19.529
Elphie, listen to them.

02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:22.908
Please.

02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:24.992
Good advice, young lady.

02:11:24.993 --> 02:11:26.535
Listen, uh, Elphaba,

02:11:26.536 --> 02:11:31.248
if you can pull this off
first crack out of the box...

02:11:31.249 --> 02:11:35.252
Oh. Oh, my golly. I can't even imagine...

02:11:35.253 --> 02:11:38.673
And I meant every word
about you having a home here.

02:11:38.674 --> 02:11:41.133
It's gonna be you and me

02:11:41.134 --> 02:11:44.303
and, hey, if it'd make you happy,

02:11:44.304 --> 02:11:47.390
possibly your friend.

02:11:47.391 --> 02:11:48.642
Really?

02:11:50.018 --> 02:11:51.228
Why not?

02:11:52.979 --> 02:11:54.523
No.

02:11:56.566 --> 02:11:58.526
- Elphaba.
- [gasps]

02:11:58.527 --> 02:12:01.321
You want to do yourself some good?
Get her back.

02:12:04.574 --> 02:12:06.868
Elphie. Elphie!

02:12:11.039 --> 02:12:13.000
[grunting]

02:12:13.625 --> 02:12:14.626
[Madame Morrible] Listen.

02:12:19.381 --> 02:12:20.716
Listen!

02:12:22.259 --> 02:12:25.052
If you want to keep your families safe,

02:12:25.053 --> 02:12:27.889
you'll stay loyal to our Wizard.

02:12:28.473 --> 02:12:31.350
She did this! The green one.

02:12:31.351 --> 02:12:33.645
Don't let her get away!

02:12:34.354 --> 02:12:36.523

Elphie, where are you going?

02:13:22.361 --> 02:13:24.445
Elphie, what are you doing? [yelps]

02:13:24.446 --> 02:13:26.239
Oh. Oh! No.

02:13:26.948 --> 02:13:29.451
Elphaba, please. Come back.
Let's just have a word with them.

02:13:30.410 --> 02:13:31.827
Elphie. Elphie.

02:13:31.828 --> 02:13:32.995
What are you doing?

Guards. Guards. Guards.

02:14:03.193 --> 02:14:07.488
There's a fugitive at large
here in the palace.

02:14:07.489 --> 02:14:10.993
Bring her to me.

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:12.911
[panting]

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:17.249
Let's go.

02:14:18.125 --> 02:14:20.418
- Elphaba, what are you doing?
- Just follow me. Follow me.

02:14:20.419 --> 02:14:23.087
- Where? What? Are you out of your mind?
- [grunts]

02:14:23.088 --> 02:14:24.839
Goodness, Elphaba,
you're being ridiculous.

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:27.092
- [Elphaba] Just come on.
- [Glinda] Where are you going?

02:14:27.968 --> 02:14:28.969
[Elphaba] Up.

02:14:30.887 --> 02:14:32.471

02:14:32.472 --> 02:14:34.348

Calm down.
You have got to let him explain.

02:16:25.419 --> 02:16:26.670
Over my dead body.

This is everything you've dreamed of.

02:16:36.304 --> 02:16:39.515
Elphaba, this is so much bigger than us.

02:16:39.516 --> 02:16:41.642
Why couldn't you have stayed calm
for once,

02:16:41.643 --> 02:16:43.601
