00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:07.545
Ladies and gentlemen,
this final round match will be

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:10.681
the best of
three tie-break sets.

00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:13.234
To the right of my chair,
we have Patrick Zweig.

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:15.787
Yes, Patrick!

00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:18.157
To the left of my chair,

00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:20.324
we have Art Donaldson.

00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:30.472
Donaldson won the toss
and has elected to serve.

00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:35.976
First set.

00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:40.185
- All right!
- All right, let's bring it!

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:42.225
Hey, we love you, Art!

00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:49.722
Donaldson to serve.

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.930
Ready? Play.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.050
Out!

00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:18.619
Fifteen, love.

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.524
That's our boy.
Go, go.

00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:33.502
Fifteen all.

00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:11.335
Let's go!

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:12.508
Fifteen, 30.

00:04:43.064 --> 00:04:44.064
Let's go.

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:59.083
<i>Every premiere event and the...</i>

00:04:59.084 --> 00:05:00.999
Man,
that ankle's jammed.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.915
I'll just stretch it
from here.

00:05:04.418 --> 00:05:06.381
Good. Nice and relaxed.

00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:09.119
All right, put a little pressure back
and I want you to inhale.

00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:12.990
<i>Okay,
let's check out today's</i>

00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:15.766
<i>first round matchups.
Mary Jo, let's be honest...</i>

00:05:15.767 --> 00:05:17.392
Again.

00:05:17.393 --> 00:05:18.566
<i>I mean, it's safe to say that
Donaldson is a huge favorite</i>

00:05:18.567 --> 00:05:20.600
<i>against the French teen,
Du Maurier.</i>

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:22.219
<i>Well, on paper, he is.</i>

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.838
<i>But because
he had surgery last year...</i>

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.773
Bryan, we have the practice court
booked at 8:00,

00:05:25.774 --> 00:05:27.739
so we should probably head out
in about 15 minutes.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.504
Yep,
he'll be ready by then.

00:05:29.505 --> 00:05:31.314
<i>In your first two-fifty,
as a qualifier...</i>

00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:32.646
- Hey, Art? Just relax.
- Lily,

00:05:32.647 --> 00:05:33.745
you have to have some fruit
with your breakfast.

00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:34.844
<i>If Art can start to get</i>

00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:36.410
<i>some confidence
and play well.</i>

00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:37.482
<i>This is a great opportunity
to end that losing streak</i>

00:05:37.483 --> 00:05:38.851
<i>going into the US Open.</i>

00:05:38.852 --> 00:05:40.384
<i>Feels like he needs this win.</i>

00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:42.004
<i>Remember what he's
going for this year.</i>

00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:43.623
<i>He's got the six
Grand Slam titles,</i>

00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:46.028
<i>two at Wimbledon,
two Aussie Opens,</i>

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:47.329
<i>two French Opens,</i>

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.531
<i>but he has been
chasing in vain,</i>

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:51.815
<i>for years,
that elusive US Open title</i>

00:05:51.816 --> 00:05:54.099
<i>to complete
the Career Slam.</i>

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.985
<i>What do you think,
any shot that he gets it this year?</i>

00:05:55.986 --> 00:05:57.870
<i>I mean, it's not looking good.</i>

00:05:57.871 --> 00:05:59.935
<i>I mean, if we just go
on the results this season,</i>

00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:01.779
<i>it's going to be
tough for him.</i>

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.532
<i>But you can never count a guy
like Art out of the conversation.</i>

00:06:04.533 --> 00:06:07.285
<i>He's got himself back healthy,
he's in really good shape,</i>

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:09.277
<i>he's got a great
support team around him.</i>

00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:11.649
<i>His coach, Tashi Donaldson,
who also is his wife,</i>

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.021
<i>has added a couple
of people to his team.</i>

00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:16.361
<i>He's got a new physiotherapist,
and he's got a new hitting partner.</i>

00:06:16.362 --> 00:06:18.794
<i>So everything's there
for him to do well.</i>

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.660
<i>Now it's just the matter can he get
his game back on track.</i>

00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:22.527
<i>Yeah,
his fans are hoping we'll start</i>

00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:23.795
<i>to see more of the...</i>

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.516
All right, I'm going
to go check on the car.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.506
Can you have pancakes?

00:06:29.107 --> 00:06:30.167
I don't know, can I?

00:06:31.744 --> 00:06:32.903
Feed me.

00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:34.941
- No, you're too old.
- No, who says that?

00:06:34.942 --> 00:06:36.980
- Who said I'm old?
- You said that.

00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:38.039
- Here.
- No,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.250
grandmas can have pancakes,
come on.

00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:40.699
<i>Just a matter of...</i>

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.147
One bite. I won't tell.

00:06:42.148 --> 00:06:43.481
<i>...if he can click
into that mindset.</i>

00:06:43.482 --> 00:06:44.816
<i>Exactly.
And you know he's got</i>

00:06:44.817 --> 00:06:46.315
<i>a lot of things
going for him here.</i>

00:06:46.316 --> 00:06:48.026
<i>He knows this tournament,
he likes this tournament,</i>

00:06:48.027 --> 00:06:49.491
<i>and he's won here a few times.</i>

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.820
<i>And he's got
a great record on hard courts.</i>

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:52.989
<i>So, if he can somehow</i>

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.388
<i>find a way to get...</i>

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:55.764
Your mom and dad are
going to go to work,

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:56.761
and then you and me
are gonna do some reading,

00:06:56.762 --> 00:06:58.333
and then go swimming
at the pool.

00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:59.900
Can we watch a movie?

00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:01.863
Later, first we're gonna
keep reading the book

00:07:01.864 --> 00:07:03.237
we started yesterday.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.100
The one about the giraffe?

00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:07.638
Mm, no,
we finished that one.

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.177
We're gonna keep
reading the one...

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:10.441
Inside out!

00:07:11.707 --> 00:07:12.781
Cross.

00:07:15.052 --> 00:07:16.052
Inside out.

00:07:17.616 --> 00:07:18.616
Down the line.

00:07:21.218 --> 00:07:22.856
There was
a massager in the car?

00:07:22.857 --> 00:07:25.086
- You grabbed that, right?
- No, the other one.

00:07:25.087 --> 00:07:26.863
Oh, yeah,
it's in there.

00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:29.598
I want you to force him
into as many backhand rallies as you can.

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:31.060
He has one big weapon,
and he wants to use it

00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:32.801
against you,
so take it away from him.

00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:38.273
<i>The BB and T Atlanta Open</i>

00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:40.477
<i>is a non-smoking event.</i>

00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:42.896
<i>All use of tobacco products
and e-cigarettes</i>

00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:44.756
<i>is strictly prohibited
on event grounds</i>

00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:46.615
<i>except for designated
smoking areas.</i>

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:49.881
Mr. Donaldson...
Mr. Donaldson, would you?

00:07:49.882 --> 00:07:51.588
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.685
- I'm rooting for you.
- Did you see that look?

00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:55.783
- He's gonna crush me, huh?
- Don't think about it, Leo.

00:07:56.822 --> 00:07:58.662
Art, over here, over here!

00:08:41.535 --> 00:08:42.535
Yeah?

00:08:43.472 --> 00:08:44.708
They're ready for you.

00:08:50.378 --> 00:08:51.378
You ready?

00:08:58.488 --> 00:08:59.657
Decimate that little bitch.

00:09:55.078 --> 00:09:56.677
<i>Yeah,
this match is looking like</i>

00:09:56.678 --> 00:09:58.276
<i>what we've come to expect
from Donaldson.</i>

00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:00.215
<i>Just can't seem
to find his footing.</i>

00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:03.553
<i>And it's given Du Maurier
the confidence he needs.</i>

00:10:03.554 --> 00:10:04.749
<i>- Out!
- Ouch,</i>

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.384
<i>this is getting brutal.</i>

00:10:06.385 --> 00:10:08.851
<i>You just can't
be missing shots like that.</i>

00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:18.692
<i>And there goes the racket.</i>

00:10:18.693 --> 00:10:20.529
<i>- Yeah, you...</i>
- He was playing really well.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.604
<i>...can really see
the frustration setting in.</i>

00:10:21.605 --> 00:10:22.803
<i>I mean, I get it.</i>

00:10:22.804 --> 00:10:23.966
I'm pulling you
out of Cincinnati.

00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:25.242
- Baby.
- Might as well

00:10:25.243 --> 00:10:26.710
pull you out of the Open too,

00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:28.710
if this isn't gonna be
your year then, why bother?

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.446
I'm just rusty.
It's a confidence thing.

00:10:30.447 --> 00:10:32.178
Get your fucking
confidence back.

00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:34.616
I can't do that for you.

00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:36.079
No one's asking you to.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.360
When you play
like that, you are.

00:10:38.824 --> 00:10:40.920
I would've killed
to have a recovery like yours.

00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:43.327
I literally would
fucking stab someone.

00:10:43.328 --> 00:10:44.727
A child, an old lady, like...

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.290
I think that
they're almost done, okay?

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:48.062
- Where are they?
- In the living room.

00:10:48.063 --> 00:10:50.328
They're watching Daddy's match
from earlier today.

00:10:51.537 --> 00:10:52.834
Mom said
we could watch it.

00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:55.168
What do we need to do
to get you to play again?

00:10:57.169 --> 00:10:58.941
What do you
need me to do, hmm?

00:11:02.545 --> 00:11:04.141
- Hey, baby.
- Mommy?

00:11:04.142 --> 00:11:06.980
- What's up?
- Can we watch <i>Spider-Verse?</i>

00:11:06.981 --> 00:11:09.080
Of course we can.
Of course we can. Come here.

00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:11.184
We're just talking about
tennis right now.

00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:13.289
But you're always
talking about tennis.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.155
I know. I know.

00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:17.351
Uh, ooh, how about this?

00:11:17.352 --> 00:11:18.858
How about you
start it with Grandma?

00:11:18.859 --> 00:11:20.457
And then,
I'll come in a second

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:22.357
and we can order some room service
and watch it together.

00:11:22.358 --> 00:11:24.025
- How about that?
- What do they have

00:11:24.026 --> 00:11:25.195
for room service?

00:11:25.196 --> 00:11:26.831
I don't know.
I don't know, I...

00:11:33.742 --> 00:11:35.175
She likes it here.

00:11:38.317 --> 00:11:39.751
We can keep staying here.

00:11:43.484 --> 00:11:44.484
We can.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:51.562
We can stay here.
We can just be rich people.

00:11:51.563 --> 00:11:53.259
That's all you
think you can handle.

00:11:54.695 --> 00:11:56.224
We can travel.

00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:58.066
We can do
the foundation full-time.

00:12:00.099 --> 00:12:01.872
Or you keep being
a tennis player.

00:12:04.234 --> 00:12:06.536
Which is what you are. Still.

00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:10.512
What do you want?

00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.358
What do you want?

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.892
I'm gonna be a tennis player.

00:12:29.893 --> 00:12:32.735
Good. Good.

00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:34.338
Okay,
well, we need to get you

00:12:34.339 --> 00:12:35.703
some more match time then.

00:12:35.704 --> 00:12:37.068
I can play Cincinnati.

00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:39.272
No. No, you cannot.
Not like this.

00:12:40.477 --> 00:12:42.279
Okay, how about,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.309
how about New Rochelle?

00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:48.776
- That's a challenger.
- Yeah, I know that.

00:12:48.777 --> 00:12:51.383
It's in a couple of days.
Maybe we can get you a wildcard.

00:12:54.722 --> 00:12:56.058
- Art?
- Hmm.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.654
You need to start winning.

00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:03.560
Right now, you're getting crushed
by guys like Du Maurier.

00:13:05.405 --> 00:13:07.552
So we need to go somewhere,

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:09.700
where there's absolutely nobody

00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:12.668
on the other side of the net
who can shake your fucking confidence.

00:13:14.575 --> 00:13:16.138
Okay?

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:18.540
That's why we're going to...

00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:21.820
Phil's Tire Town Challenger.

00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:26.079
- Don't get knocked out the first round.
- You're evil.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.490
Yeah, well, I'm gonna call Tom,
see if he can get you in the draw.

00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:29.828
- Hey.
- Yeah.

00:13:31.087 --> 00:13:32.087
I love you.

00:13:33.297 --> 00:13:35.089
I know.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.626
<i>How much do you think
you'd pay the first serve today?</i>

00:13:36.627 --> 00:13:38.292
<i>Honestly.
He looks like he doesn't</i>

00:13:38.293 --> 00:13:39.945
<i>even wanna be out there.</i>

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.333
Hey!

00:14:10.334 --> 00:14:12.835
Can I pay tomorrow?

00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:16.335
I've been driving all day,
I'm exhausted.

00:14:16.336 --> 00:14:18.500
You know, if we gave out
a bed to every tired person

00:14:18.501 --> 00:14:20.873
who walked in here
asking for one...

00:14:20.874 --> 00:14:22.175
Right.

00:14:22.176 --> 00:14:24.810
...we'd be a homeless shelter
not a business.

00:14:24.811 --> 00:14:25.840
Uh-huh.

00:14:28.653 --> 00:14:30.877
Listen, I'm a tennis player.

00:14:30.878 --> 00:14:33.391
- Hmm.
- You know the tournament down the road?

00:14:33.392 --> 00:14:35.021
Oh, that, uh... The thing

00:14:35.022 --> 00:14:37.491
- at the country club.
- Right, right.

00:14:37.492 --> 00:14:40.343
- Yeah.
- Well, you get $7,000 if you win.

00:14:40.344 --> 00:14:42.902
And you get money
just for qualifying.

00:14:42.903 --> 00:14:44.932
I just... I need a place
to stay tonight

00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:46.963
so I can rest before
my first match.

00:14:46.964 --> 00:14:50.132
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:52.501
I need a card on file.

00:14:52.502 --> 00:14:54.411
What if I signed a racket
and gave it to you?

00:14:54.412 --> 00:14:55.702
- Sir.
- Mm-hmm.

00:14:55.703 --> 00:14:58.543
Sir, I don't know who you are.

00:15:03.582 --> 00:15:04.886
- I told you I'm...
- Look at this guy.

00:15:04.887 --> 00:15:06.201
...a professional
tennis player.

00:15:06.202 --> 00:15:07.516
- He's a disaster.
- I don't know,

00:15:07.517 --> 00:15:09.788
- I think he's kind of cute.
- Carl, he smells.

00:15:09.789 --> 00:15:11.556
- The racket alone...
- He's an athlete.

00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:13.324
- ...is worth like...
- He doesn't look

00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:14.858
like an athlete,
he looks like a hobo.

00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:15.930
...$300.

00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:17.493
Very tall,
very handsome hobo.

00:15:17.494 --> 00:15:19.668
You're like a dog.

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:22.070
We need a card that works.

00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:24.036
Look at him,
he can't pay for the room.

00:15:24.037 --> 00:15:25.170
Should we invite him

00:15:25.171 --> 00:15:26.811
to come stay with us?

00:15:29.414 --> 00:15:30.414
Hey!

00:15:31.482 --> 00:15:34.341
Hello! Name?

00:15:34.342 --> 00:15:36.217
Barry Gardner.

00:15:36.218 --> 00:15:39.087
You know, this looks very different
from the website.

00:15:39.088 --> 00:15:41.124
Oh, we're doing
some renovations.

00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:43.692
I just think you should
maybe update your pictures

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:44.961
to reflect, you know...

00:15:44.962 --> 00:15:48.030
<i>The Clinton campaign paid</i>

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:52.795
<i>a million dollars
to use your GPS to hire...</i>

00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:41.679
Sir, you can't sleep here.

00:16:47.793 --> 00:16:49.459
I'm not.
I'm playing at the...

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.125
Sir, this is a private club.

00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:52.289
- I'm gonna have to ask you...
- No.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.357
- ...to leave.
- No, no, no.

00:16:53.358 --> 00:16:55.528
I'm in the Challenger.
I'm a player.

00:16:56.868 --> 00:16:59.334
Oh. Well...

00:17:02.171 --> 00:17:03.635
You're a bit early
for check-in.

00:17:04.368 --> 00:17:05.806
We're just opening up.

00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:25.387
Just head right in there.
She's just setting up.

00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:37.741
Can I help you?

00:17:37.742 --> 00:17:39.935
I'm a tennis player.

00:17:42.374 --> 00:17:45.380
I'm playing
in the Challenger.

00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:47.516
Name?

00:17:47.517 --> 00:17:49.010
Patrick Zweig.

00:17:51.384 --> 00:17:53.489
Oh, wow!
That's right.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.588
You are!

00:17:58.557 --> 00:18:00.057
You probably
don't remember this,

00:18:00.058 --> 00:18:01.843
but I was
one of the line judges

00:18:01.844 --> 00:18:03.629
at the Junior US Open
back in '06.

00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:08.964
Huh, wow.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.442
You hungry?

00:18:15.612 --> 00:18:16.807
Uh...

00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:18.875
Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:20.111 --> 00:18:21.251
Thanks.

00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:27.752
Mm-mm.

00:18:28.719 --> 00:18:30.523
Well, we're happy
to have you here.

00:18:30.524 --> 00:18:35.927
You got your first match
against Grosu this afternoon.

00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:38.597
Should be a nice tournament.
Supposed to get a little windy mid-week,

00:18:38.598 --> 00:18:40.904
but hopefully it'll clear up
before the finals.

00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:42.603
- Fingers crossed.
- I was wondering,

00:18:42.604 --> 00:18:45.004
is there any chance for an advance payment
on the prize money?

00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:48.373
- Oh.
- Just because I'm...

00:18:48.374 --> 00:18:50.474
I know I'm guaranteed
a minimum of $400

00:18:50.475 --> 00:18:52.248
even if I get
knocked out today.

00:18:52.249 --> 00:18:54.546
Well, generally, we don't give
out the winnings until

00:18:54.547 --> 00:18:55.883
player makes his way
through the tournament.

00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:57.383
Right. It's just...

00:18:57.384 --> 00:18:59.481
I had a problem
with my card at the hotel.

00:18:59.482 --> 00:19:01.254
- And...
- You could

00:19:01.255 --> 00:19:02.916
just always lose today...

00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:04.855
Then we'd have to cut
your check this evening.

00:19:09.028 --> 00:19:10.028
Right.

00:19:16.839 --> 00:19:18.401
By the way,

00:19:18.402 --> 00:19:20.009
there's a rumor
going around

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.938
that we had
a last-minute wildcard.

00:19:24.343 --> 00:19:25.546
Wanna guess who it is?

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.775
Who?

00:20:13.864 --> 00:20:15.497
Advantage, Donaldson.

00:20:22.732 --> 00:20:24.935
- Come on!
- Go, let's go!

00:20:29.244 --> 00:20:30.413
Fault!

00:20:39.022 --> 00:20:40.588
Fuck!

00:20:42.051 --> 00:20:44.552
Code violation,
audible obscenity.

00:20:44.553 --> 00:20:46.220
Warning, Donaldson.

00:20:47.797 --> 00:20:48.959
Deuce.

00:20:57.704 --> 00:20:59.344
- All right.
- Come on, Art.

00:21:09.999 --> 00:21:12.287
Advantage, Zweig.

00:21:12.288 --> 00:21:14.439
Get it together, Art.
You got this.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.591
He almost got
another penalty.

00:21:48.484 --> 00:21:49.921
Yeah!

00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:51.362
Yes!

00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:55.157
Let's go!

00:21:56.701 --> 00:21:57.863
Yeah!

00:22:00.168 --> 00:22:01.497
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:22:01.498 --> 00:22:04.441
Come on. Come on. Come on.

00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:07.405
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, guys!

00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:08.804
Thank you, man.

00:22:08.805 --> 00:22:10.070
- Good play.
- Good one, man.

00:22:10.071 --> 00:22:11.507
- Nice meeting you.
- Good one, man.

00:22:11.508 --> 00:22:13.396
Yeah.

00:22:15.286 --> 00:22:16.787
Fire and Ice, baby.
Let's go!

00:22:16.788 --> 00:22:18.416
Take it off!

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.494
- Can you do me a favor?
- Mm-hmm.

00:22:27.495 --> 00:22:29.079
Can you not
demolish me tomorrow?

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.664
- Shut the fuck up.
- Listen,

00:22:30.665 --> 00:22:32.861
I'm at peace with the fact
that you're going to win.

00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:35.267
- It's not a fact.
- I'm just saying,

00:22:35.268 --> 00:22:37.672
throw me a couple of games,
maybe a set.

00:22:37.673 --> 00:22:39.966
If it matters to you so much,
I can just give it to you.

00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:41.274
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:22:41.275 --> 00:22:42.509
- Wow! Thanks.
- I mean,

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.226
every once in a while
a kid who wins juniors

00:22:44.227 --> 00:22:45.942
turns out to be
an actually great player,

00:22:45.943 --> 00:22:48.546
but most of them end up
in, like, the top 300.

00:22:48.547 --> 00:22:50.180
- It's a curse.
- You said,

00:22:50.181 --> 00:22:52.520
you seemed pretty excited
about winning the doubles trophy.

00:22:52.521 --> 00:22:54.957
That was different.
That was just you and me.

00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:56.086
This is really fun.

00:22:57.554 --> 00:22:58.726
Huh.

00:23:00.162 --> 00:23:01.399
All right, well...

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.212
But you have to actually play.

00:23:04.213 --> 00:23:05.664
You know,
you can't just retire.

00:23:05.665 --> 00:23:07.650
I need it to look like
I really beat you.

00:23:07.651 --> 00:23:09.636
Mm. Have you got money
on this or something?

00:23:09.637 --> 00:23:11.554
No. My grandma,
she's gonna be watching

00:23:11.555 --> 00:23:13.472
with her nursing home.
She keeps calling me

00:23:13.473 --> 00:23:15.641
telling me
how proud she is.

00:23:15.642 --> 00:23:17.242
Don't guilt me
with your dying grandmother.

00:23:29.689 --> 00:23:31.320
Now entering the court...

00:23:31.321 --> 00:23:33.492
Did Mark tell you
about the party on Long Island?

00:23:33.493 --> 00:23:35.024
- The Adidas thing?
- Yeah.

00:23:35.025 --> 00:23:36.767
- Anna Mueller.
- Yeah, I'm not going.

00:23:36.768 --> 00:23:37.859
What? Why not?

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.095
We have
a final tomorrow.

00:23:40.096 --> 00:23:43.000
- I just told you I'd let you win.
- Mm-hmm.

00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:45.538
Don't you want to meet Tashi Duncan?

00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:48.077
You don't get it, man.
You've never seen her in person.

00:23:48.078 --> 00:23:49.446
She's in another league.

00:23:49.447 --> 00:23:51.245
- And now entering...
- You mean her game?

00:23:51.246 --> 00:23:53.565
No, I mean,
she's the hottest woman I've ever seen.

00:23:53.566 --> 00:23:55.885
And winner
of the Junior Australian Open,

00:23:55.886 --> 00:23:57.111
Tashi Duncan.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.253
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

00:24:23.847 --> 00:24:26.140
Ladies and gentlemen,
this final round match

00:24:26.141 --> 00:24:28.277
will be the best
of three tie-break sets.

00:24:28.278 --> 00:24:30.414
To the left of the chair,
from Switzerland,

00:24:30.415 --> 00:24:32.247
Anna Mueller.

00:24:32.248 --> 00:24:34.385
To the right of the chair,
from the United States,

00:24:34.386 --> 00:24:36.150
Tashi Duncan.

00:24:36.151 --> 00:24:38.652
Duncan won the toss
and elected to serve.

00:24:38.653 --> 00:24:39.794
Fuck.

00:24:48.001 --> 00:24:50.772
First set, Duncan to serve.
Ready?

00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:53.041
Play.

00:25:07.116 --> 00:25:09.021
Look at that
fucking backhand.

00:25:13.626 --> 00:25:14.624
Fifteen, love.

00:25:38.485 --> 00:25:39.854
Forty, love.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.182
Come on!

00:26:12.421 --> 00:26:13.421
Forty, thirty.

00:27:10.477 --> 00:27:14.042
She's gonna turn her whole family
into millionaires.

00:27:14.043 --> 00:27:15.914
She'll have a fashion line,

00:27:15.915 --> 00:27:17.787
a nutritional supplement,

00:27:18.453 --> 00:27:20.588
a foundation.

00:27:20.589 --> 00:27:22.537
The Tashi Duncan Center
for Girls.

00:27:22.538 --> 00:27:24.485
Taking at-risk youth
off the streets

00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:26.121
- and onto the courts.
- Come on. Don't make fun, man.

00:27:26.122 --> 00:27:27.656
She's a remarkable
young woman.

00:27:27.657 --> 00:27:29.598
I know.

00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:31.702
I know,
she's a pillar of the community.

00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:37.103
I'd let her fuck me
with a racket.

00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:43.640
Oh, God.
Look, Anna Mueller.

00:28:31.659 --> 00:28:34.828
- Oh, my God.
- Oy.

00:28:34.829 --> 00:28:36.558
I'm gonna go get my drink.

00:28:43.708 --> 00:28:45.703
- Hey, I'm Patrick Zweig.
- Art Donaldson.

00:28:45.704 --> 00:28:47.041
I know who you are.

00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:49.294
You're Fire and Ice, right?

00:28:49.295 --> 00:28:50.748
- Oh, my God.
- In the flesh.

00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:55.392
Which one's which?

00:28:55.393 --> 00:28:56.710
What do you think?

00:28:58.085 --> 00:29:00.347
You were
fucking incredible today.

00:29:00.348 --> 00:29:01.425
- Thank you.
- No, really. I mean,

00:29:01.426 --> 00:29:03.416
it wasn't even,
like, tennis.

00:29:03.417 --> 00:29:05.085
It was an entirely
different game.

00:29:05.086 --> 00:29:06.891
I felt bad for Anna.

00:29:06.892 --> 00:29:08.554
Oh, uh, don't.
She's a sore loser

00:29:08.555 --> 00:29:10.196
And a racist bitch.

00:29:12.699 --> 00:29:13.699
She'll be okay.

00:29:15.706 --> 00:29:17.032
You're going
to Stanford, right?

00:29:17.033 --> 00:29:18.402
Yeah, how'd you know that?

00:29:19.875 --> 00:29:22.741
Um...
I just accepted my offer

00:29:22.742 --> 00:29:24.056
and they mentioned you.

00:29:24.057 --> 00:29:25.371
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:29:25.372 --> 00:29:26.732
- Oh.
- You're not going pro?

00:29:28.714 --> 00:29:29.820
No, not yet.

00:29:31.923 --> 00:29:34.357
Why do you waste your time
playing college tennis?

00:29:34.358 --> 00:29:36.449
Baby...

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.222
I need to steal you
for a second.

00:29:38.223 --> 00:29:39.995
- Over at the trophies.
- Uh, okay.

00:29:40.927 --> 00:29:42.565
I have to go
take pictures.

00:29:42.566 --> 00:29:45.225
So, um, it was nice
meeting you both.

00:29:45.226 --> 00:29:46.298
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:29:49.505 --> 00:29:50.505
Okay.

00:30:10.095 --> 00:30:11.559
Now what?

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.075
What do you mean?
That was it.

00:30:13.076 --> 00:30:14.591
You don't wanna
stick around,

00:30:14.592 --> 00:30:16.263
- try to talk to her again?
- No, no, that'll seem too desperate.

00:30:16.264 --> 00:30:18.333
We should just wait
for the shuttle back to the hotel.

00:30:18.334 --> 00:30:19.463
Yeah, sure.

00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:21.432
Okay.

00:30:23.204 --> 00:30:24.498
Bring it up
for me a little bit.

00:30:24.499 --> 00:30:27.042
All right.
Great, great. Good job.

00:30:31.109 --> 00:30:33.048
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Let's go.

00:30:43.288 --> 00:30:45.922
Bye,
Miss Stanford University.

00:30:45.923 --> 00:30:47.029
Okay, bye.

00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:50.565
- Hey!
- Hi!

00:30:52.027 --> 00:30:53.068
Hi.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.002
You guys are still here.

00:30:56.003 --> 00:30:57.803
- Great party!
- Uh-huh, yeah.

00:30:58.133 --> 00:30:59.601
Thank you.

00:30:59.602 --> 00:31:02.054
Um, don't you guys have a final?

00:31:02.055 --> 00:31:03.998
Shouldn't you be, like, um,
preparing or something?

00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:05.942
- Oh, it's just the juniors.
- I think we both know

00:31:05.943 --> 00:31:07.082
how it's gonna go.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.182
Okay, well, um,
it's cool that you stayed.

00:31:11.183 --> 00:31:12.348
- Yeah. I actually wanted...
- Yeah.

00:31:12.349 --> 00:31:13.480
...to ask you about
that point earlier...

00:31:13.481 --> 00:31:15.621
- Hey, do you smoke?
- Cigarettes?

00:31:15.622 --> 00:31:16.652
- Yeah.
- No.

00:31:17.857 --> 00:31:19.754
- Do you?
- Yeah.

00:31:20.896 --> 00:31:22.163
Want to go down
to the beach?

00:31:26.567 --> 00:31:27.803
Sure.

00:31:27.804 --> 00:31:29.202
This place is ridiculous,
isn't it?

00:31:29.203 --> 00:31:31.365
What do you mean?
What do you mean? It's nice.

00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:33.568
It's like a castle.

00:31:33.569 --> 00:31:35.505
Like, they wanna be
feudal lords or something.

00:31:35.506 --> 00:31:37.708
Oh, and what does
your parents' place look like?

00:31:37.709 --> 00:31:39.046
Exactly.

00:31:39.047 --> 00:31:40.816
- Not like this.
- No, it's bigger.

00:31:40.817 --> 00:31:44.179
No. I mean, yeah,
technically it is. Yeah.

00:31:49.425 --> 00:31:52.262
So, I have to ask
you about this Stanford thing.

00:31:52.263 --> 00:31:53.359
Okay.

00:31:55.466 --> 00:31:57.824
What's the angle?

00:31:57.825 --> 00:32:00.013
Why do you want to go beat up
on a bunch of girls

00:32:00.014 --> 00:32:02.203
who were the best players
at their high schools?

00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:11.677
You know,
they offer classes in college.

00:32:11.678 --> 00:32:14.479
I don't want my only skill in life
to be hitting a ball with a racket.

00:32:15.748 --> 00:32:16.811
I get it.

00:32:19.416 --> 00:32:20.584
You're making us
wait for you.

00:32:22.959 --> 00:32:24.856
The 18-year-old
tennis phenomenon

00:32:24.857 --> 00:32:26.755
who cares about
her education.

00:32:28.096 --> 00:32:29.593
Is this why you
came to my party?

00:32:31.262 --> 00:32:33.230
It's brilliant. Seriously.

00:32:33.231 --> 00:32:35.434
I can already see
the Adidas campaign.

00:32:36.938 --> 00:32:38.107
And when are you going pro?

00:32:40.236 --> 00:32:41.506
Soon as I can.

00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:44.613
Hitting a ball with a racket
is a great way

00:32:44.614 --> 00:32:46.143
to avoid having a job.

00:32:46.144 --> 00:32:48.377
Well, that's also
your problem.

00:32:48.378 --> 00:32:50.315
'Cause you think
that tennis is about

00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:52.252
expressing yourself,
doing your thing.

00:32:52.253 --> 00:32:54.783
- That's why you still have that serve.
- It works.

00:32:56.619 --> 00:32:58.325
Yeah, but you're not
a tennis player.

00:33:00.523 --> 00:33:02.032
You don't know
what tennis is.

00:33:03.192 --> 00:33:04.331
What is it?

00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:07.268
It's a relationship.

00:33:13.109 --> 00:33:14.789
Is that what you
and Anna Mueller had today?

00:33:16.811 --> 00:33:18.048
It is, actually.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.775
For about 15 seconds there,
we were actually playing tennis,

00:33:22.776 --> 00:33:24.950
and we understood
each other completely.

00:33:24.951 --> 00:33:26.155
So did everyone watching.

00:33:27.626 --> 00:33:29.158
It was like we were in love.

00:33:33.895 --> 00:33:35.560
Or like we didn't exist.

00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:40.730
We went somewhere

00:33:41.805 --> 00:33:43.296
really beautiful together.

00:33:43.297 --> 00:33:44.299
You screamed.

00:33:50.681 --> 00:33:52.815
When you hit the winner.

00:33:52.816 --> 00:33:54.711
Never heard
anything like it before.

00:34:06.255 --> 00:34:07.456
I should go

00:34:07.457 --> 00:34:09.540
before my dad comes
looking for me.

00:34:09.541 --> 00:34:11.624
- I'll see you at school, Art.
- Wait,

00:34:11.625 --> 00:34:13.423
- are you on Facebook?
- What?

00:34:13.424 --> 00:34:15.222
He's asking
for your number.

00:34:16.364 --> 00:34:17.404
And so am I.

00:34:19.077 --> 00:34:21.205
- You both want my number?
- Very much so, yeah.

00:34:21.206 --> 00:34:23.144
- Yeah.
- Okay, well,

00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:25.039
- I'm not a homewrecker.
- We don't live together.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.578
- It's an open relationship.
- Also, Patrick has a girlfriend.

00:34:27.579 --> 00:34:30.052
I do not. Hey,
come hang out with us later.

00:34:30.053 --> 00:34:32.569
They put you up at the hotel
in Flushing, right?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.087
- We're in Room 206.
- Want me to come tuck you in?

00:34:35.088 --> 00:34:37.886
No. We just keep talking...

00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:39.855
About tennis.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.898
Good night.

00:34:43.899 --> 00:34:46.059
- We have beer.
- Okay.

00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:14.791
I'm looking
in my bag right now.

00:35:14.792 --> 00:35:17.524
Did you look
in the small pocket on the side?

00:35:17.525 --> 00:35:19.413
I promise that's in there.

00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:27.786
It's broken.

00:35:27.787 --> 00:35:31.136
- And she's not coming.
- She might.

00:35:31.137 --> 00:35:33.377
You made it sound like
we wanted to fuck her in here.

00:35:33.378 --> 00:35:34.577
We do want to
fuck her in here.

00:35:34.578 --> 00:35:37.615
Okay, yeah, maybe.
But what was your plan?

00:35:37.616 --> 00:35:39.923
All right, let's say she did come over.
Then what?

00:35:39.924 --> 00:35:41.751
We just like,
keep shooting our shot

00:35:41.752 --> 00:35:44.621
until she ends up making out
with one of us, hopefully,

00:35:44.622 --> 00:35:46.960
and the other one,
sits in the bathroom?

00:35:46.961 --> 00:35:48.661
Sure, if it came to that.

00:35:48.662 --> 00:35:51.228
- What? You think that's beneath you?
- I think it's beneath her.

00:35:51.229 --> 00:35:52.562
What if she chooses you?

00:35:52.563 --> 00:35:54.099
You won't feel comfortable
sending me away?

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.770
She's not coming, Patrick!

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.287
- Art!
- What?

00:36:14.288 --> 00:36:15.854
- Fucking ash!
- I found it.

00:36:15.855 --> 00:36:16.886
Oh, dude.

00:36:21.665 --> 00:36:22.665
Wait.

00:36:23.061 --> 00:36:24.061
Oh, shit.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:26.863
- Hi!
- Hey!

00:36:28.571 --> 00:36:31.533
Did you guys go to, like,
Mommy And Me classes together?

00:36:33.804 --> 00:36:35.544
What?
You just seem like brothers.

00:36:35.545 --> 00:36:38.706
Well, that's what the Mark Rebellato
Tennis Academy will do for you.

00:36:38.707 --> 00:36:40.445
Oh. Right, right, right.

00:36:40.446 --> 00:36:42.183
You guys went
to boarding school.

00:36:42.184 --> 00:36:44.645
Mm. We've been bunkmates
since we were 12.

00:36:44.646 --> 00:36:46.012
- So...
- That's really cute.

00:36:46.013 --> 00:36:47.714
You ever thought about
doing something like that?

00:36:47.715 --> 00:36:48.848
- Boarding school?
- Mm.

00:36:48.849 --> 00:36:50.292
No. No, no, no.
We couldn't afford it.

00:36:50.293 --> 00:36:52.128
And even if I could get
a scholarship or something,

00:36:52.129 --> 00:36:53.729
there's no way that
my parents would want me

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.331
coming of age
in an environment like that.

00:36:56.325 --> 00:36:57.493
Huh.

00:36:57.494 --> 00:36:59.368
Why? What were
they afraid of?

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.240
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:07.700
So, um, is that
where you met your girlfriend?

00:37:07.701 --> 00:37:09.169
Oh, she's not my, um...

00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:11.509
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.046
And you?
Why aren't you pretending

00:37:13.047 --> 00:37:14.148
not to have a girlfriend?

00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:15.747
- Art's in between ladies.
- Oh, no, no.

00:37:15.748 --> 00:37:17.347
That makes it sound
like I'm some sort of...

00:37:17.348 --> 00:37:18.416
- Player.
- Yeah.

00:37:18.417 --> 00:37:20.187
Yeah,
Art does fine for himself.

00:37:20.188 --> 00:37:22.358
I mean, look at him.

00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:23.956
So...

00:37:26.557 --> 00:37:28.096
How often
does this happen?

00:37:28.097 --> 00:37:29.761
- Uh...
- Going after the same girl.

00:37:29.762 --> 00:37:31.426
Not as often
as you think actually.

00:37:31.427 --> 00:37:32.427
- Really?
- No.

00:37:32.428 --> 00:37:33.694
Yeah, no, we, uh...

00:37:33.695 --> 00:37:35.060
We usually have
different types.

00:37:35.061 --> 00:37:38.003
Hmm. So you're saying
I should be flattered?

00:37:38.004 --> 00:37:39.336
- Well...
- No.

00:37:39.337 --> 00:37:40.772
Aren't you
everybody's type?

00:37:47.314 --> 00:37:48.751
What about the two of you?

00:37:48.752 --> 00:37:50.111
What do you mean?

00:37:55.285 --> 00:37:56.538
Oh!

00:37:56.539 --> 00:37:57.791
No.

00:37:57.792 --> 00:37:59.494
No.

00:38:01.063 --> 00:38:02.959
Why? Is that surprising?

00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:09.803
What?

00:38:09.804 --> 00:38:11.132
- Well...
- No.

00:38:12.667 --> 00:38:14.537
- I mean...
- No.

00:38:14.538 --> 00:38:16.006
- Patrick, no.
- Sorry.

00:38:16.007 --> 00:38:17.555
Yes. I think you need
to tell me now.

00:38:17.556 --> 00:38:19.104
- No.
- I think it's a sweet story.

00:38:19.105 --> 00:38:21.245
- Uh-huh. All right.
- Well, let's hear it.

00:38:21.246 --> 00:38:22.807
Yeah, no, go ahead.

00:38:22.808 --> 00:38:24.085
Uh...

00:38:24.086 --> 00:38:27.247
I taught Art
how to jerk off, so.

00:38:30.591 --> 00:38:33.293
Okay. Patrick was
an early bloomer, okay?

00:38:33.294 --> 00:38:35.813
And I think
that I was on time.

00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:38.333
And one time,
when we were 12,

00:38:38.334 --> 00:38:41.437
he thought I was asleep
and he was, you know...

00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:44.601
- Jerking off.
- Jerking off. And, yeah...

00:38:44.602 --> 00:38:46.336
And I asked him,
"What are you doing?"

00:38:46.337 --> 00:38:47.504
And he told me.

00:38:47.505 --> 00:38:49.104
- He's jerking off.
- Jerking off.

00:38:49.105 --> 00:38:52.144
He asked me if I had ever done it before
and I told him no.

00:38:52.145 --> 00:38:54.714
And so, he just...

00:38:55.314 --> 00:38:57.152
He showed me how.

00:39:00.324 --> 00:39:02.120
What do you mean
he showed you how?

00:39:02.121 --> 00:39:03.255
No. I mean...

00:39:03.256 --> 00:39:04.927
- Well...
- I mean, he did it

00:39:04.928 --> 00:39:06.795
- on his bed.
- Okay.

00:39:06.796 --> 00:39:09.196
I did it on my bed. We did it together,
but like on opposite sides...

00:39:09.197 --> 00:39:10.592
- in the room.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:39:10.593 --> 00:39:11.896
You know.

00:39:15.134 --> 00:39:16.036
Silent?

00:39:16.037 --> 00:39:17.371
- Oh, no, no.
- No, no.

00:39:17.372 --> 00:39:19.933
No, we were talking
about Kat, weren't we?

00:39:19.934 --> 00:39:21.105
- Kat Zimmerman.
- Patrick said

00:39:21.106 --> 00:39:22.277
- it's always better...
- Yeah.

00:39:22.278 --> 00:39:23.660
...if you're like thinking
about somebody

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:25.042
when you're doing it.
And so I asked him

00:39:25.043 --> 00:39:27.149
who you're thinking about,
and he was talking about this girl,

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.246
- Kat Zimmerman.
- Kat Zimmerman.

00:39:29.247 --> 00:39:31.344
And so, I thought
about her, too.

00:39:32.747 --> 00:39:34.145
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:39:34.146 --> 00:39:36.475
Okay,
and who finished first?

00:39:36.476 --> 00:39:38.805
- Oh, I don't remember.
- I think you.

00:39:40.497 --> 00:39:43.447
And, well,
how was it afterwards?

00:39:43.448 --> 00:39:46.398
I think Art
was a little surprised

00:39:46.399 --> 00:39:48.293
by the whole thing.
He was...

00:39:48.294 --> 00:39:50.415
He was just sitting there
covered in all of it.

00:39:50.416 --> 00:39:52.538
- What?
- He looked like a kid

00:39:52.539 --> 00:39:54.176
who'd spilled milk
all over his lap.

00:39:54.177 --> 00:39:56.542
Jesus, Patrick!

00:39:56.543 --> 00:39:58.307
I knew enough already
at this point

00:39:58.308 --> 00:39:59.891
- to have a sock nearby.
- Right.

00:39:59.892 --> 00:40:01.476
Forgot to tell Art
about that part.

00:40:01.477 --> 00:40:02.646
Yeah.

00:40:02.647 --> 00:40:03.817
Mm-hmm.

00:40:05.352 --> 00:40:06.384
Yeah, so.

00:40:06.385 --> 00:40:09.438
- Yeah.
- Right. Okay.

00:40:09.439 --> 00:40:12.491
And what about
Miss Zimmerman?

00:40:12.492 --> 00:40:14.629
Whatever happened to her?
You guys...

00:40:15.757 --> 00:40:17.157
Neither of us...

00:40:17.158 --> 00:40:19.594
She got injured
a week later and had to quit.

00:40:19.595 --> 00:40:20.997
Really?

00:40:20.998 --> 00:40:21.896
She wasn't
very good in the first place.

00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:23.071
- No, she sucked.
- Yeah.

00:40:23.072 --> 00:40:25.397
Yeah.

00:40:25.398 --> 00:40:27.207
Yeah, no, you're right.
That is a very cute story.

00:40:27.208 --> 00:40:28.959
Thanks.

00:40:33.478 --> 00:40:34.649
We're out of beer.

00:40:43.124 --> 00:40:44.593
Um...

00:41:09.854 --> 00:41:10.854
Come here.

00:41:12.083 --> 00:41:14.150
Which one of us would you...

00:43:41.633 --> 00:43:42.698
Okay.

00:43:47.441 --> 00:43:48.645
I'm going to bed.

00:43:51.039 --> 00:43:52.604
What about your number?

00:43:52.605 --> 00:43:54.816
- I told you, I'm not a homewrecker.
- Please.

00:43:55.647 --> 00:43:57.954
Um...

00:43:57.955 --> 00:44:00.114
Okay, uh...

00:44:00.115 --> 00:44:01.918
I will be watching
your match tomorrow.

00:44:01.919 --> 00:44:03.788
Whoever wins
can have my number.

00:44:03.789 --> 00:44:05.321
All right.

00:44:06.826 --> 00:44:08.662
You can beat him,
you know that.

00:44:08.663 --> 00:44:10.498
You should
beat him actually.

00:44:10.499 --> 00:44:12.064
Are you saying
you want me to?

00:44:12.065 --> 00:44:14.061
I'm saying you're not going
to get my number if you don't.

00:44:14.062 --> 00:44:15.328
But what do you want?

00:44:15.329 --> 00:44:18.466
I want to watch
some good fucking tennis.

00:44:21.012 --> 00:44:22.012
Good night.

00:44:28.544 --> 00:44:30.343
Remember when you said
you'd let me win?

00:44:30.344 --> 00:44:32.114
That was
a lifetime ago.

00:44:32.115 --> 00:44:33.488
- What about my grandmother?
- Hope she has

00:44:33.489 --> 00:44:35.587
a fucking stroke.

00:45:06.213 --> 00:45:08.219
Wow.

00:45:11.887 --> 00:45:13.224
Thirty, forty.

00:45:15.694 --> 00:45:16.960
That's how you do it!

00:45:16.961 --> 00:45:20.099
Nice!
That's the way you play!

00:45:20.995 --> 00:45:21.995
Go!

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.925
Thirty, love.

00:45:50.428 --> 00:45:52.577
- Forty, love.
- Come on, Art, you got this!

00:45:52.578 --> 00:45:54.727
- It's not over, Art!
- Hang in there, Art!

00:45:56.139 --> 00:45:57.301
Fault!

00:46:09.277 --> 00:46:11.665
Game and first set, Zweig.

00:46:11.666 --> 00:46:14.054
Zweig leads one set to love.

00:47:05.602 --> 00:47:08.768
So stupid losing
to guys like this, Victor.

00:47:13.317 --> 00:47:14.845
Fucking idiot.

00:47:28.464 --> 00:47:29.464
Fuck.

00:47:44.505 --> 00:47:46.311
Nice match, Zweig.

00:47:48.418 --> 00:47:51.048
You too, Grosu.

00:47:51.049 --> 00:47:52.482
Tough break.

00:47:58.344 --> 00:47:59.929
Calm, Victor.

00:48:15.772 --> 00:48:17.677
What are you doing
with your life?

00:48:17.678 --> 00:48:18.912
How did you get like this?

00:48:18.913 --> 00:48:21.913
You can't beat some
fucking loser like him?

00:48:21.914 --> 00:48:23.117
How can you call yourself...

00:48:37.132 --> 00:48:39.699
So, do you,
like, play at Wimbledon

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.263
or the US Open or what?

00:48:42.264 --> 00:48:44.897
Yeah, sometimes.
When I qualify.

00:48:46.135 --> 00:48:47.936
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:48:47.937 --> 00:48:49.738
What does that mean?

00:48:49.739 --> 00:48:54.112
Well, those big tournaments
usually have spots for 128 players.

00:48:54.113 --> 00:48:55.947
So if you're ranked
in the top 100,

00:48:55.948 --> 00:48:58.050
then you instantly get a spot,

00:48:58.051 --> 00:49:00.854
but everyone else has
to play a sort of, uh,

00:49:00.855 --> 00:49:02.739
tournament before
the tournament.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.624
- Okay.
- Some years I make it,

00:49:04.625 --> 00:49:06.553
some years I don't.

00:49:06.554 --> 00:49:08.842
But, um, if I win this thing
in New Rochelle,

00:49:08.843 --> 00:49:11.132
my ranking will be
high enough for the Open.

00:49:12.096 --> 00:49:13.229
So, you'll get a spot?

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:16.236
I'll get a spot
in the qualifiers.

00:49:17.808 --> 00:49:20.009
Oh, okay.

00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:22.506
I told you tennis is boring.

00:49:23.172 --> 00:49:24.777
No, really...

00:49:24.778 --> 00:49:26.743
It's, um, it's interesting.

00:49:26.744 --> 00:49:27.775
Excuse me.

00:49:29.313 --> 00:49:30.948
Can I get a tea
with some lemon?

00:49:30.949 --> 00:49:32.417
Coming right up.

00:49:37.587 --> 00:49:41.327
Uh, so, tell me
about real estate law.

00:49:43.327 --> 00:49:45.694
Uh, I don't know,
well, um...

00:49:46.669 --> 00:49:48.300
- My firm...
- Mm-hmm.

00:49:48.301 --> 00:49:50.973
Well, it's not my firm,
but the firm that I work for,

00:49:50.974 --> 00:49:52.971
we actually do something
called estate planning.

00:49:52.972 --> 00:49:54.670
Which is a little different.

00:49:54.671 --> 00:49:57.836
I used to do real estate law
with this firm in Hartsdale...

00:49:57.837 --> 00:49:59.089
which I don't know
if you know where that is

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:00.342
- but it's just five minutes...
- Thank you.

00:50:00.343 --> 00:50:01.760
...down the road
if you're driving,

00:50:01.761 --> 00:50:03.178
but, um, yeah,
I left that firm.

00:50:03.179 --> 00:50:05.677
It was small. Anyway.

00:50:05.678 --> 00:50:09.185
- Um, I deal with trusts and...
- Trust.

00:50:09.186 --> 00:50:11.268
...uh, power of attorney...

00:50:11.269 --> 00:50:13.352
Go ask them about the beds.

00:50:13.353 --> 00:50:14.819
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.428
Do you want us to wait
to FaceTime with Dad?

00:50:16.429 --> 00:50:18.667
No, no, it's okay.
Do you mind taking this upstairs for me?

00:50:18.668 --> 00:50:19.966
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay. Love you.

00:50:19.967 --> 00:50:21.030
- We'll be right up.
- All right, honey.

00:50:21.031 --> 00:50:22.299
All right, see you.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.167
Anything that, you know,
you have to deal with

00:50:24.168 --> 00:50:27.043
when someone crosses over...

00:50:28.502 --> 00:50:30.507
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

00:50:30.508 --> 00:50:32.514
Are you... Are you okay?

00:50:32.515 --> 00:50:33.973
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

00:50:35.149 --> 00:50:37.515
Can you excuse me?
I just have to...

00:50:38.421 --> 00:50:39.421
Yeah.

00:50:47.392 --> 00:50:49.044
What the fuck
are you doing here?

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.697
I'm playing
at the Challenger.

00:50:50.698 --> 00:50:52.295
Yeah, I know that.

00:50:52.296 --> 00:50:54.164
But you're not staying here,
are you?

00:50:54.165 --> 00:50:56.631
No. Why are you staying here?

00:50:56.632 --> 00:50:58.833
I assumed you guys would
rent a villa or something.

00:50:59.708 --> 00:51:01.209
Lily likes hotels.

00:51:03.404 --> 00:51:04.873
Our daughter.

00:51:04.874 --> 00:51:06.574
Oh.

00:51:06.575 --> 00:51:08.245
Art can't see us together.
He already thinks

00:51:08.246 --> 00:51:09.910
I planned this
to humiliate him.

00:51:11.381 --> 00:51:13.716
Didn't you?

00:51:14.459 --> 00:51:15.520
Not this part.

00:51:26.297 --> 00:51:27.896
Are you on a fucking date?

00:51:27.897 --> 00:51:29.198
No.

00:51:29.199 --> 00:51:31.107
Well, yeah, but it's not...

00:51:32.777 --> 00:51:34.209
I just need
a place to sleep.

00:51:35.205 --> 00:51:36.205
- What?
- Wow.

00:51:36.206 --> 00:51:37.579
Can't all stay at the Ritz.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.440
Mm. Okay, well.

00:51:39.441 --> 00:51:41.850
Can you seal the deal
and leave?

00:51:41.851 --> 00:51:43.516
You're on opposite sides
of the draw.

00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:46.879
You're not gonna play each other unless
you're both in the final.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.551
I don't think we have
to worry about that.

00:51:48.552 --> 00:51:51.292
No, you typically fall apart
in the second round.

00:51:55.823 --> 00:51:57.028
Your mom looks good.

00:51:57.029 --> 00:51:58.893
I know she does, Patrick.

00:52:05.106 --> 00:52:06.401
Do me a favor.

00:52:06.402 --> 00:52:08.001
Stay the fuck
away from us.

00:52:21.153 --> 00:52:22.521
Sorry, that was a, uh...

00:52:23.857 --> 00:52:24.985
Uh, hey...

00:52:31.992 --> 00:52:34.098
<i>Junior training sessions</i>

00:52:34.099 --> 00:52:36.205
<i>will now take place
on court six.</i>

00:52:41.209 --> 00:52:43.009
<i>Will Coach Stevens</i>

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.810
<i>please report to
the main office?</i>

00:52:44.811 --> 00:52:46.105
<i>Coach Stevens.</i>

00:52:47.479 --> 00:52:49.245
What do you mean
you won't say?

00:52:49.246 --> 00:52:51.011
- I don't kiss and tell.
- Since when?

00:52:51.012 --> 00:52:53.618
Since she told me
she'd stop seeing me if I told anyone.

00:52:58.453 --> 00:52:59.690
And go!

00:53:00.955 --> 00:53:02.930
- Yep, yep, good.
- All right.

00:53:04.465 --> 00:53:06.366
Right, but she had to know
that you were gonna talk to me.

00:53:06.367 --> 00:53:08.036
She didn't indicate that
there were any exceptions.

00:53:08.037 --> 00:53:11.038
All right, fine.
Then give me a signal.

00:53:11.039 --> 00:53:12.456
Isn't this hard
for you to hear?

00:53:12.457 --> 00:53:14.447
Like, wouldn't you
rather not?

00:53:14.448 --> 00:53:16.438
No. I'm very happy for you.

00:53:16.439 --> 00:53:18.043
I just don't wanna
feel left out.

00:53:21.851 --> 00:53:22.977
There you go!

00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:27.684
Okay, how about this?

00:53:27.685 --> 00:53:29.384
If the two of you slept together,
do a normal serve.

00:53:29.385 --> 00:53:30.991
- Art.
- I'm not asking

00:53:30.992 --> 00:53:33.190
you to tell me.
I'm just saying,

00:53:33.191 --> 00:53:35.024
if you fucked,
serve like me.

00:53:35.025 --> 00:53:36.859
- Like you?
- Yeah.

00:53:39.068 --> 00:53:40.967
You know you have
a tic, right?

00:53:40.968 --> 00:53:42.866
Before you throw the ball up

00:53:42.867 --> 00:53:45.148
you place it in the exact center
of the neck of the racket.

00:53:53.612 --> 00:53:56.014
Okay, fine, yeah.
Do that. If you fucked.

00:53:56.015 --> 00:53:58.234
I'm not telling you
anything, Art.

00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:00.454
You won't be telling me anything.
Come on.

00:55:25.605 --> 00:55:27.572
- Everything okay?
- I'm okay, thank you.

00:55:27.573 --> 00:55:29.541
- Excuse me, Tashi.
- No, it's okay.

00:55:37.847 --> 00:55:38.917
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:55:38.918 --> 00:55:40.015
Of course.

00:55:46.186 --> 00:55:49.365
<i>Time. Second set.
Donaldson to serve.</i>

00:56:21.119 --> 00:56:22.827
There you go!

00:56:37.625 --> 00:56:39.478
He's pretty funny.

00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.216
He's, like,
always cracking jokes.

00:56:41.217 --> 00:56:43.017
It just sounds so hard.

00:56:43.018 --> 00:56:44.178
It's not.

00:56:45.588 --> 00:56:47.982
I don't know I feel,
like, out of all my classes...

00:56:47.983 --> 00:56:50.169
All right,
so when are you going pro?

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:52.357
Um, well,
if we win the championship,

00:56:52.358 --> 00:56:54.690
- then I'll leave.
- So, May.

00:56:54.691 --> 00:56:57.590
- I said, if we win.
- Right. So, May.

00:56:57.591 --> 00:57:00.167
Um...

00:57:00.168 --> 00:57:01.501
Did Patrick tell you
he's coming

00:57:01.502 --> 00:57:04.371
- to the Pepperdine match?
- Hmm. Yeah, he told me.

00:57:04.372 --> 00:57:06.534
We should get dinner
or something.

00:57:06.535 --> 00:57:07.770
Sure. If you want.

00:57:10.979 --> 00:57:12.263
What's up?

00:57:12.264 --> 00:57:13.548
Nothing.

00:57:14.575 --> 00:57:15.649
Art.

00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:19.421
The whole thing you're doing,
you're not good at it.

00:57:19.422 --> 00:57:21.282
- It's fucking stupid.
- I'm not doing a thing.

00:57:21.283 --> 00:57:23.055
I'm just surprised that you guys are
still seeing each other.

00:57:23.056 --> 00:57:24.058
That's all.

00:57:27.921 --> 00:57:29.091
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

00:57:32.502 --> 00:57:34.668
Why did you ask me
to come to lunch with you?

00:57:35.767 --> 00:57:37.105
I told you,
I had extra meal credits

00:57:37.106 --> 00:57:38.370
and they were
going to expire.

00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:39.619
Don't be such
a fucking pussy.

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:40.868
Is he seeing other girls
on tour?

00:57:40.869 --> 00:57:42.389
- No, I mean...
- Is that what this is?

00:57:43.343 --> 00:57:44.410
- I don't know.
- What?

00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:45.627
That's not what
I'm trying to say.

00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:46.845
Then what are you
trying to say?

00:57:50.252 --> 00:57:51.619
Okay.

00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:56.448
He's not in love
with you.

00:58:06.132 --> 00:58:08.372
What makes you think
I want someone to be in love with me?

00:58:09.372 --> 00:58:10.669
Did I ever say I was
in love with him?

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:11.967
- You didn't.
- So why would I give a fuck

00:58:11.968 --> 00:58:13.568
- if he loved me or not?
- I guess you wouldn't.

00:58:13.569 --> 00:58:14.675
- Cool.
- Cool.

00:58:16.038 --> 00:58:17.225
Don't you think
you deserve it?

00:58:17.226 --> 00:58:18.412
Jesus fucking Christ.

00:58:18.413 --> 00:58:19.977
I mean, who wouldn't be
in love with you?

00:58:25.216 --> 00:58:26.755
Think you might be
the worst friend in the world.

00:58:26.756 --> 00:58:27.911
Maybe.

00:58:27.912 --> 00:58:29.019
Definitely!

00:58:30.358 --> 00:58:32.693
Thank you.
For lunch, Art.

00:58:43.372 --> 00:58:45.339
Whoo-hoo! Let's go!

00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.507
Who the fuck is this guy?

00:58:47.508 --> 00:58:49.336
- Does he go here?
- I don't know.

00:58:49.337 --> 00:58:51.310
- I don't... I don't think so.
- Come on, Donaldson,

00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:52.581
big serve! Big serve!

00:58:57.846 --> 00:58:58.880
That's right, baby!

00:58:58.881 --> 00:59:00.380
Show that motherfucker
who's boss.

00:59:02.886 --> 00:59:04.758
Finish it up, Donaldson,
come on.

00:59:11.826 --> 00:59:12.865
Whoa!

00:59:13.664 --> 00:59:14.735
All right.

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.708
Come on. Come on. Come on.

00:59:24.276 --> 00:59:25.339
Art!

00:59:28.176 --> 00:59:29.215
Out of the way,
out of the way!

00:59:50.264 --> 00:59:51.706
So, how's the tour?

00:59:52.933 --> 00:59:54.038
No fun stuff?

00:59:54.736 --> 00:59:55.838
Like what?

00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:57.608
I don't know.
Are you seeing anybody?

00:59:57.609 --> 00:59:59.907
What do you mean?
I'm taken.

00:59:59.908 --> 01:00:01.188
What do you think
I'm doing here?

01:00:07.753 --> 01:00:09.053
You're not here
to visit me?

01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:13.453
What?

01:00:18.633 --> 01:00:20.153
You're really committing
to this thing?

01:00:21.633 --> 01:00:23.202
- To Tashi?
- Hmm.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:25.462
Yeah. I mean,

01:00:25.463 --> 01:00:27.500
we're taking it step by step,
but, you know...

01:00:28.506 --> 01:00:29.678
I like her.

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:33.814
I think she'd make me
an honest man.

01:00:37.652 --> 01:00:40.248
- You don't believe me?
- No, I'm just...

01:00:40.249 --> 01:00:43.489
I'm not sure how she's thinking
about all of this.

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:44.792
I don't want you
to get hurt.

01:00:47.218 --> 01:00:48.820
You don't want me to get hurt?

01:00:48.821 --> 01:00:49.863
Hmm.

01:00:53.162 --> 01:00:55.198
- Did she say something to you?
- No.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.968
I just got the impression
she's not thinking

01:00:58.969 --> 01:01:01.875
about this as
a serious relationship.

01:01:03.213 --> 01:01:04.663
You got that impression?

01:01:04.664 --> 01:01:06.114
From a conversation we had.

01:01:06.115 --> 01:01:08.046
- Huh!
- Hmm.

01:01:12.782 --> 01:01:14.288
You fucking snake.

01:01:14.289 --> 01:01:16.515
Honestly, I'm proud of you.

01:01:16.516 --> 01:01:19.088
- I'd be doing the same thing.
- I'm not doing anything.

01:01:19.089 --> 01:01:21.730
It's fine. It's exciting
to see you this way.

01:01:22.995 --> 01:01:24.130
It's what's been missing
from your tennis.

01:01:24.131 --> 01:01:26.424
What?

01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:28.796
It's nice to see you
lit up about something.

01:01:28.797 --> 01:01:31.167
Even if that something
is my girlfriend.

01:01:31.168 --> 01:01:32.766
That's what the two of you
are calling each other now?

01:01:32.767 --> 01:01:34.531
Hmm.

01:01:34.532 --> 01:01:36.338
You know this makes
it hotter for me, right?

01:01:37.513 --> 01:01:39.445
You sitting here
pining for her.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:40.613
I would never do anything

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:41.948
- to get in the way of you...
- I know.

01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:43.283
- ...and your girlfriend.
- I know.

01:01:43.284 --> 01:01:44.544
It's not your style.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:47.646
You're playing
percentage tennis.

01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:49.890
Waiting for me to fuck up.

01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:56.930
Come on,
walk me over there.

01:02:39.441 --> 01:02:40.732
I missed you.

01:02:47.475 --> 01:02:49.745
You have any idea
how lonely it is on tour?

01:02:49.746 --> 01:02:51.344
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02:51.345 --> 01:02:53.344
Is that why you haven't won
any challengers?

01:02:53.345 --> 01:02:55.219
I just told you I missed you.

01:03:12.169 --> 01:03:15.238
I watched
the Shinoda match online.

01:03:15.239 --> 01:03:16.970
And you could've won,
but then you started tanking

01:03:16.971 --> 01:03:18.308
in the third set.

01:03:19.679 --> 01:03:21.479
- Tashi, come on.
- What?

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.609
Look at me.

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:25.749
When were you gonna
tell me about Art?

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:27.416
Thought you knew about that.

01:03:28.322 --> 01:03:29.517
I mean...

01:03:31.189 --> 01:03:33.625
I feel bad because
I know he's in pain,

01:03:33.626 --> 01:03:35.688
- but...
- Right, but?

01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:38.999
What? You're not
intimidated by him?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.958
No.

01:03:39.959 --> 01:03:42.229
- Really?
- No.

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:44.499
- Well, you should be.
- Uh-huh. Why?

01:03:46.168 --> 01:03:47.942
- Because he's smart.
- Yeah.

01:03:48.841 --> 01:03:50.942
- He's good looking.
- Yeah.

01:03:50.943 --> 01:03:53.141
And he's really
fucking good at tennis.

01:03:53.142 --> 01:03:54.946
Oh, he's always
been very good.

01:03:54.947 --> 01:03:57.352
Yeah,
but he's gotten a lot better

01:03:57.353 --> 01:03:58.645
since he's been here.

01:04:00.054 --> 01:04:01.820
Are the two of us
still playing for your number?

01:04:01.821 --> 01:04:04.057
I thought I won.

01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:06.685
That's your problem.

01:04:06.686 --> 01:04:08.897
You always think you've won
before the match is over.

01:04:12.129 --> 01:04:13.561
Are we talking
about tennis?

01:04:15.463 --> 01:04:16.872
We're always
talking about tennis.

01:04:19.539 --> 01:04:20.667
Can we not?

01:04:27.348 --> 01:04:28.348
Sure.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.716
What are you doing?

01:04:34.717 --> 01:04:36.613
I'm getting ready
for my match.

01:04:36.614 --> 01:04:39.026
Start my routine.
I'll see you there.

01:04:40.594 --> 01:04:42.062
- Tashi.
- What?

01:04:42.063 --> 01:04:43.631
If you're not interested
in me fixing your game for free,

01:04:43.632 --> 01:04:45.593
don't worry about it.
It's fine.

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:48.626
Why do you care so much?

01:04:48.627 --> 01:04:50.230
Well, we're dating, right?
So, I don't know.

01:04:50.231 --> 01:04:51.835
Should be a little embarrassing
if you suck.

01:04:51.836 --> 01:04:54.004
- I suck now?
- God.

01:04:54.005 --> 01:04:55.999
It's not college tennis
out there.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.580
We can't all walk around
calling ourselves "The Duncanator."

01:04:59.581 --> 01:05:01.140
- Wow.
- I'm sorry. I just...

01:05:01.141 --> 01:05:03.310
Okay. No, it's fine.

01:05:03.311 --> 01:05:04.645
Look, I'm happy
they like you here.

01:05:04.646 --> 01:05:05.981
I just don't need you
to be my coach.

01:05:05.982 --> 01:05:07.417
Well, someone needs to be.

01:05:09.525 --> 01:05:10.756
Can we just start over?

01:05:10.757 --> 01:05:12.683
What do you think
you need from me?

01:05:12.684 --> 01:05:14.918
Honestly, what do you think
you need from me?

01:05:14.919 --> 01:05:17.458
A cheerleader? A girlfriend?
A fuck buddy?

01:05:17.459 --> 01:05:19.998
Like, there's plenty
of girls out here that would

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:21.896
love to be
your girlfriend, okay?

01:05:21.897 --> 01:05:23.599
You're charming.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.120
You're talented, you got a big dick.
Just go be with one of them.

01:05:27.944 --> 01:05:29.559
Is this like,
a new strategy you're using

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.174
to pump yourself up
before the match?

01:05:31.175 --> 01:05:33.290
Have a little fight
to get the energy going?

01:05:33.291 --> 01:05:35.407
I don't need a fight
to get the energy going.

01:05:35.408 --> 01:05:37.180
No. Just an hour
of meditation.

01:05:37.181 --> 01:05:38.962
And what?
You think that's lame?

01:05:38.963 --> 01:05:40.988
I think it's unnecessary
given you're playing

01:05:40.989 --> 01:05:43.013
Sally Fucking Country Club
from Pepperdine.

01:05:43.014 --> 01:05:45.917
And how's coasting
by on talent going for you?

01:05:48.664 --> 01:05:50.311
You know
how ridiculous it is

01:05:50.312 --> 01:05:51.959
to hear you
call me every week,

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.869
talking about all the ways
that you're getting screwed over on tour?

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:56.961
As if that's a good use
for my fucking time?

01:05:56.962 --> 01:06:00.767
- Well, excuse me for inconveniencing you.
- You are, actually.

01:06:00.768 --> 01:06:02.871
I need to be alone.
So can I just meet you there?

01:06:02.872 --> 01:06:04.741
- No.
- What?

01:06:04.742 --> 01:06:07.048
I'm not going to the match.
Not if you think you can just dismiss me.

01:06:07.049 --> 01:06:09.245
I'm not some fucking lapdog
who's gonna sit around

01:06:09.246 --> 01:06:11.562
and let you punish me.
I'm not Art.

01:06:11.563 --> 01:06:13.879
Or maybe you need
someone like that.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.822
Someone who's gonna hop on board
and be Mr. Tashi Duncan.

01:06:16.823 --> 01:06:18.788
Is that what
you think I want?

01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:20.754
Yeah. A member
of the fan club.

01:06:25.967 --> 01:06:27.530
You're not a member
of my fan club?

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.905
I'm your peer.
I'm not your fucking groupie.

01:06:31.906 --> 01:06:33.437
And I'm definitely
not your student.

01:06:35.939 --> 01:06:36.939
All right.

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.340
Good luck, champ.

01:07:27.993 --> 01:07:29.629
- Come on.
- Hi.

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:31.024
- Sorry.
- Hi.

01:07:31.025 --> 01:07:32.067
Thank you.

01:07:34.027 --> 01:07:38.001
<i>And now, your 2002, 2005,</i>

01:07:38.002 --> 01:07:41.799
<i>and 2006 NCAA champion,</i>

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.039
<i>give it up for
Stanford Women's Tennis.</i>

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.707
Go Stanford!

01:07:46.283 --> 01:07:47.577
Hey!

01:07:49.414 --> 01:07:51.449
Tashi!

01:07:52.454 --> 01:07:54.221
Tashi!

01:07:57.056 --> 01:07:59.688
Tashi! We love you, Tashi!

01:08:04.467 --> 01:08:06.464
Yeah, whoo!

01:08:07.801 --> 01:08:09.203
Tashi!

01:08:10.903 --> 01:08:12.140
Yeah, let's go!

01:08:27.389 --> 01:08:30.551
<i>On court one,
Maria Foster from Pepperdine,</i>

01:08:30.552 --> 01:08:33.219
<i>and from Stanford,
Tashi Duncan.</i>

01:08:40.727 --> 01:08:42.896
We love you, Tashi!

01:09:48.298 --> 01:09:49.935
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:09:57.576 --> 01:10:00.641
Okay, Tashi,
you're okay. You're okay.

01:10:00.642 --> 01:10:02.811
out of the way!

01:10:02.812 --> 01:10:04.982
On your back.
Okay, try to breathe.

01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:06.553
Okay, you're okay.

01:10:08.821 --> 01:10:10.753
Okay, okay, okay.

01:10:12.755 --> 01:10:15.458
Look at me.
Tashi, look at me, okay?

01:10:15.459 --> 01:10:17.643
Just breathe.
Just breathe. Breathe.

01:10:17.644 --> 01:10:19.827
It's torn up pretty bad,

01:10:19.828 --> 01:10:21.559
but we won't know for sure
until we get the X-rays

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.694
from the hospital.

01:10:22.695 --> 01:10:24.132
Did you see it happen?

01:10:24.133 --> 01:10:25.569
Yeah, it was pretty quick.

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:28.568
Just a slip and then
she landed on it the wrong way.

01:10:28.569 --> 01:10:30.235
That's all it takes.

01:10:30.236 --> 01:10:33.776
Yeah. Let's just hope
it's not as bad as it looks.

01:10:35.216 --> 01:10:36.810
Did you get an ETA
on the ambulance?

01:10:36.811 --> 01:10:38.885
Yeah, they said
they're on their way.

01:10:42.583 --> 01:10:43.815
- I'm sorry.
- Out.

01:10:43.816 --> 01:10:45.521
- Listen, Tashi! Tashi...
- Get out! Out!

01:10:45.522 --> 01:10:46.995
- Tashi, Tashi, listen, please.
- Out!

01:10:46.996 --> 01:10:48.923
- Out!
- Patrick, get the fuck out!

01:11:31.303 --> 01:11:32.669
Out!

01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:34.037
Thirty, love.

01:11:34.038 --> 01:11:35.490
That was out!

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:36.942
That was way out!

01:11:36.943 --> 01:11:39.078
The ball was called in.

01:11:39.079 --> 01:11:40.446
- Are you blind?
- Zweig!

01:11:40.447 --> 01:11:42.247
Are you here to do your job,
or you're just excited

01:11:42.248 --> 01:11:43.913
that Art Donaldson's
over there?

01:11:43.914 --> 01:11:46.710
I'm going to give you a code violation
if you don't stop this.

01:11:46.711 --> 01:11:48.120
Hey, Art!

01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:49.888
This lady wants
your autograph.

01:11:53.084 --> 01:11:55.753
Code violation.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.

01:11:55.754 --> 01:11:57.629
Point penalty, Zweig.

01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:02.168
- Come on, Patrick!
- Just play the game.

01:12:02.169 --> 01:12:03.797
This how you wanna
get your points?

01:12:03.798 --> 01:12:06.335
- I'm ready to serve, Patrick.
- Yeah, I bet.

01:12:06.336 --> 01:12:07.507
Forty, love.

01:12:20.857 --> 01:12:22.555
Stop going easy on me.

01:12:25.056 --> 01:12:26.119
I'm not.

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:40.489
- Hit the ball!
- Tashi...

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:42.509
Actually fucking
hit the ball.

01:12:44.174 --> 01:12:45.174
Come on.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.417
You afraid you're
gonna hurt me?

01:12:53.854 --> 01:12:54.854
Pussy.

01:12:59.024 --> 01:13:00.024
Wait!

01:13:05.228 --> 01:13:06.500
Okay?

01:13:13.602 --> 01:13:15.003
And actually try to win.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.743
Please.

01:13:40.862 --> 01:13:42.331
- Hey.
- I'm fine.

01:13:42.332 --> 01:13:43.334
You okay?

01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:47.841
I'm good.
I'm okay.

01:14:01.482 --> 01:14:02.482
I'm fine.

01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:04.550
I'm okay.

01:14:05.255 --> 01:14:06.285
I'm fine.

01:14:07.125 --> 01:14:08.125
I'm okay.

01:14:09.899 --> 01:14:11.526
Come here.

01:14:11.527 --> 01:14:14.199
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:15:39.747 --> 01:15:40.918
More aggressive.

01:15:45.423 --> 01:15:46.517
Little higher.

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:48.596
More aggressive.

01:15:58.569 --> 01:16:00.003
Just invite her to serve.

01:16:06.174 --> 01:16:08.041
Oh, come on, you can
sleep in tomorrow, right?

01:16:08.042 --> 01:16:09.696
Katerina's match
isn't until nighttime.

01:16:09.697 --> 01:16:11.173
No. Are you kidding?

01:16:11.174 --> 01:16:12.611
I wake her up early
to run drills.

01:16:12.612 --> 01:16:14.048
Oh, she's lucky
to have you.

01:16:14.049 --> 01:16:16.015
You're getting too much height

01:16:16.016 --> 01:16:17.681
- on your ball toss.
- I am?

01:16:17.682 --> 01:16:19.823
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Whenever you guys are ready.

01:16:19.824 --> 01:16:21.254
- Thanks.
- You're a great spot server,

01:16:21.255 --> 01:16:24.391
but right now,
you're checking in at like 129, 130.

01:16:24.392 --> 01:16:26.712
But I think with, like,
a few adjustments, you'd get to 135.

01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:31.933
But you should listen to Karl.
He is your coach.

01:16:31.934 --> 01:16:33.531
I'm just Katerina's
hitting partner.

01:16:35.305 --> 01:16:38.613
Maybe you wanna jump ship?
Come be my assistant coach?

01:16:39.741 --> 01:16:41.507
Oh, I get it.

01:16:41.508 --> 01:16:44.284
You want to work with someone who has
a little bit more potential.

01:16:44.285 --> 01:16:46.081
No! No.
No, it's not that.

01:16:46.082 --> 01:16:48.216
I mean, you have plenty
of potential. It's just...

01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:51.087
You think that would be
a good idea?

01:16:51.993 --> 01:16:52.993
Why not?

01:16:57.832 --> 01:17:00.126
- That was a long time ago.
- It was not that long ago.

01:17:00.127 --> 01:17:01.793
Well, it feels like
a long time ago.

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.905
So, you're saying you're not in love
with me anymore?

01:17:11.776 --> 01:17:13.611
I'm really
proud of you, Tashi.

01:17:13.612 --> 01:17:15.345
- I'm serious, I'm serious.
- Oh, God.

01:17:15.346 --> 01:17:17.080
- You're doing really well.
- Okay.

01:17:18.477 --> 01:17:20.296
What?
You think I was going to, like,

01:17:20.297 --> 01:17:22.115
- kill myself after the injury?
- No.

01:17:22.116 --> 01:17:23.988
No, I'm just glad
that you didn't quit tennis.

01:17:25.354 --> 01:17:28.087
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
my only skill in life

01:17:28.088 --> 01:17:29.458
is hitting a ball
with a racket.

01:17:35.097 --> 01:17:37.529
This is really stupid,
but, uh...

01:17:40.366 --> 01:17:41.973
After your injury...

01:17:44.038 --> 01:17:45.471
I couldn't help but just...

01:17:46.845 --> 01:17:49.282
think about what
would have happened

01:17:49.283 --> 01:17:51.180
if I had beaten Patrick.

01:17:53.119 --> 01:17:55.319
So you want me to join your team
because you feel guilty?

01:17:56.057 --> 01:17:57.789
No.

01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:59.826
I want you to join my team
because I want to win.

01:18:02.962 --> 01:18:05.029
I think you'd beat him now
if you guys played.

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:06.833
Don't you think?

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:09.737
Don't know.

01:18:11.336 --> 01:18:12.366
We, uh...

01:18:13.908 --> 01:18:17.442
haven't played professionally,
and don't keep in touch.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:19.260
What?

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:21.078
Just...

01:18:22.484 --> 01:18:24.851
I was a homewrecker,
wasn't I?

01:18:31.556 --> 01:18:32.925
- Art.
- Yeah.

01:18:35.889 --> 01:18:38.392
You never really said
if you're still in love with me or not.

01:18:44.338 --> 01:18:45.498
Who wouldn't be?

01:19:15.798 --> 01:19:16.903
What?

01:19:21.976 --> 01:19:25.241
I really wanna
kiss you right now.

01:19:27.712 --> 01:19:29.177
But I'm afraid if I try,

01:19:29.178 --> 01:19:31.445
you'll think I'm the worst friend
in the world.

01:19:42.955 --> 01:19:43.955
To who?

01:20:16.664 --> 01:20:18.793
Oh, my...
Oh, my God!

01:20:47.488 --> 01:20:49.355
Game and
second set, Donaldson.

01:20:49.356 --> 01:20:51.194
Six-two. Match is tied.

01:20:51.195 --> 01:20:53.235
One set all.

01:20:55.735 --> 01:20:57.905
Code violation, racket abuse.

01:20:58.572 --> 01:21:00.534
Point penalty, Zweig.

01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:04.443
Please, please.

01:21:08.548 --> 01:21:10.606
New balls, please.

01:21:22.493 --> 01:21:25.527
He's not bad. I've played him
at a few of these things.

01:21:25.528 --> 01:21:27.666
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be prostituting yourself

01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:30.183
for a place
to sleep tonight?

01:21:30.184 --> 01:21:32.699
I'm staying at
that girl's house.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.475
- Mm. Must be the love.
- Hey, come have a cigarette with me.

01:21:35.476 --> 01:21:37.176
I have to talk to you.

01:21:37.177 --> 01:21:40.343
Yeah, I don't smoke.
And I'm not talking to you.

01:22:00.296 --> 01:22:01.696
I'm going to propose
something to you.

01:22:01.697 --> 01:22:04.201
Can you blow it
away from me, please?

01:22:04.202 --> 01:22:06.368
Sorry. It's gonna
make you angry.

01:22:06.369 --> 01:22:08.536
It's gonna make you
very angry.

01:22:13.714 --> 01:22:15.246
I want you to be my coach.

01:22:18.319 --> 01:22:20.009
What?

01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:23.784
Even if he wins the Open,
completes his career Grand Slam,

01:22:23.785 --> 01:22:28.092
Art's still gonna retire as someone
who's just really, really good.

01:22:28.093 --> 01:22:30.593
That's what you guys
will have done together.

01:22:30.594 --> 01:22:33.094
But imagine if you could turn
Patrick Zweig

01:22:33.095 --> 01:22:34.793
into a guy who wins a Slam.

01:22:36.329 --> 01:22:38.197
I still have a season.

01:22:38.198 --> 01:22:39.739
I still have
one good season,

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:41.503
and I need you
to bring it out of me.

01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:46.170
So...

01:22:47.812 --> 01:22:48.906
what do you think?

01:22:50.147 --> 01:22:51.879
How fucking dare you?

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.983
Jesus Christ!

01:22:52.984 --> 01:22:54.546
You want my
best piece of advice?

01:22:54.547 --> 01:22:55.949
- Do you want me to coach you?
- Yeah.

01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:57.824
Okay, quit.

01:22:57.825 --> 01:23:00.454
Quit right now.
Right the fuck now, quit.

01:23:00.455 --> 01:23:02.224
You know that when I'm good,
I'm one of the best

01:23:02.225 --> 01:23:03.456
- in the world.
- You are 271st best

01:23:03.457 --> 01:23:05.154
- in the fucking world.
- I still have a shot.

01:23:05.155 --> 01:23:07.432
You're 31. You have a better shot
with a handgun in your mouth.

01:23:10.464 --> 01:23:12.763
I mean,
why don't you go home?

01:23:12.764 --> 01:23:15.065
Go home, ask your parents
for a seat on the board,

01:23:15.066 --> 01:23:17.744
or you know what, matter of fact,
ask them for some money. Okay?

01:23:17.745 --> 01:23:19.310
Go be like
any other spoiled kid

01:23:19.311 --> 01:23:22.241
who has ever amounted to nothing
in their fucking life,

01:23:22.242 --> 01:23:23.773
and stop this performance

01:23:23.774 --> 01:23:25.443
of being
a down-on-your-luck professional.

01:23:25.444 --> 01:23:26.744
- Tashi...
- No, you're not

01:23:26.745 --> 01:23:28.681
20 years old anymore,
and it's not cute to be

01:23:28.682 --> 01:23:30.519
walking around pretending
like you need to grind it out

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.120
at these bum-fuck tournaments,
and sleep in your fucking car.

01:23:33.121 --> 01:23:35.588
And it is unforgivable

01:23:35.589 --> 01:23:37.860
that you would ask me
to devote a single second

01:23:37.861 --> 01:23:39.624
of my fucking time

01:23:39.625 --> 01:23:41.359
to help you achieve
your fucking dreams.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.136
What dreams, Patrick?

01:23:43.802 --> 01:23:44.870
You never had any!

01:23:44.871 --> 01:23:45.952
Is that what
you and Art are doing?

01:23:45.953 --> 01:23:47.035
- Living the dream?
- That is exactly

01:23:47.036 --> 01:23:48.556
what the fuck we're doing.

01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:50.077
Then how come
you hate him?

01:23:52.743 --> 01:23:54.213
You do.

01:23:55.584 --> 01:23:57.640
It's obvious, you do.

01:23:57.641 --> 01:23:58.984
You can feel him
giving up already,

01:23:58.985 --> 01:24:00.799
even though you know
he's not going to retire

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.477
- until you let him.
- He is a grown man.

01:24:02.478 --> 01:24:04.900
- He can do whatever he wants.
- Sure, sure,

01:24:04.901 --> 01:24:07.323
but he doesn't.
He does whatever you want.

01:24:07.324 --> 01:24:10.290
Except now, he's not
even pretending to like it.

01:24:10.291 --> 01:24:12.731
He's dreaming about

01:24:12.732 --> 01:24:15.001
eating hamburgers again.

01:24:15.002 --> 01:24:16.928
Watching your daughter, um...

01:24:18.397 --> 01:24:19.897
Uh, Lily, grow up.

01:24:19.898 --> 01:24:23.033
Maybe doing some commentary
on the Tennis Channel.

01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:26.542
He's ready to be dead.

01:24:28.607 --> 01:24:29.806
And you're starting to realize

01:24:29.807 --> 01:24:31.249
you might not want
to be buried with him,

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:34.352
'cause who is he to you
if he's not playing tennis?

01:24:36.683 --> 01:24:38.521
So that's what
you think he is to me?

01:24:39.562 --> 01:24:41.051
A racket and a dick.

01:24:49.068 --> 01:24:50.698
Does Art know
about Atlanta?

01:24:54.936 --> 01:24:57.474
You keep saying you came here
because Art needed matches.

01:24:59.211 --> 01:25:01.038
I think you came
for something else.

01:25:08.579 --> 01:25:09.915
You think
I came here for you?

01:25:12.051 --> 01:25:15.261
You think I came here
to throw it all away for you?

01:25:16.623 --> 01:25:18.165
Maybe you just
wanted to see me.

01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:20.233
I have seen you.

01:25:21.769 --> 01:25:22.961
You look like shit.

01:25:25.905 --> 01:25:27.097
I'm going to beat him.

01:25:30.572 --> 01:25:32.245
If we both
make it to the final.

01:25:33.605 --> 01:25:35.572
I'm going to beat him.

01:25:35.573 --> 01:25:37.107
Even if you could beat him,

01:25:38.314 --> 01:25:39.813
it wouldn't change anything.

01:25:42.121 --> 01:25:44.222
It'll break him.
You know it will.

01:25:44.223 --> 01:25:47.260
It won't make you. Okay?
It's too late for that.

01:25:53.827 --> 01:25:55.329
My number,
in case you change your mind

01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:56.764
- about the coaching.
- I won't.

01:26:27.994 --> 01:26:29.593
Just text me.
I'll meet you by the car.

01:27:01.998 --> 01:27:02.998
Time.

01:27:10.835 --> 01:27:13.238
Final set.
Zweig to serve.

01:27:13.239 --> 01:27:14.712
Love, one.

01:27:16.074 --> 01:27:18.114
- This is it!
- Keep it up, champ.

01:27:20.756 --> 01:27:22.289
Come on, man!

01:27:24.422 --> 01:27:26.557
Let's go, let's go, Artie.

01:28:58.948 --> 01:29:01.278
Grab those!
Make sure that tent is secure.

01:29:14.133 --> 01:29:15.373
Can you do me a favor?

01:29:17.635 --> 01:29:20.198
Can you not, like,
demolish me tomorrow?

01:29:23.602 --> 01:29:25.969
Hey, congrats on being

01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:27.678
a Phil's Tire Town
Challenger finalist.

01:29:28.817 --> 01:29:29.817
Yeah, you too.

01:29:31.178 --> 01:29:32.844
Hopefully, the wind dies down
before tomorrow

01:29:32.845 --> 01:29:34.380
and we can have
a fair fight.

01:29:34.381 --> 01:29:35.548
Yeah.

01:29:35.549 --> 01:29:38.670
Art. Come on.
Can we talk?

01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:41.793
Can you put
your dick away?

01:29:43.557 --> 01:29:44.860
This is a sauna.

01:29:47.063 --> 01:29:49.059
Look, we've been here for a week
and we haven't said

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.862
two words to each other.
It's just...

01:29:51.863 --> 01:29:54.571
It's silly, man,
it's dramatic.

01:29:54.572 --> 01:29:58.038
I mean, really,
why are you so angry with me?

01:30:01.515 --> 01:30:03.746
Look, I don't buy
that it's because of Tashi,

01:30:03.747 --> 01:30:05.880
or I don't think it's because
of what happened to her.

01:30:05.881 --> 01:30:08.851
I think maybe you're still
just really disturbed

01:30:08.852 --> 01:30:12.255
by the fact that she could've
been into someone like me.

01:30:12.256 --> 01:30:14.021
When we were teenagers.

01:30:16.128 --> 01:30:17.128
Huh!

01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:22.164
When we were teenagers.

01:30:22.165 --> 01:30:24.200
<i>...which will be
taking place tomorrow evening.</i>

01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:25.734
<i>He has really been</i>

01:30:25.735 --> 01:30:27.737
<i>in tip-top form this year,
hasn't he, Jason?</i>

01:30:27.738 --> 01:30:29.099
<i>Yeah,
it's actually pretty remarkable</i>

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.908
<i>the difference
we've seen in his game.</i>

01:30:30.909 --> 01:30:33.906
<i>He's far and away the favorite right now
to win the US Open.</i>

01:30:33.907 --> 01:30:35.611
<i>I completely agree.</i>

01:30:35.612 --> 01:30:37.049
<i>And then, of course,
on the women's side</i>

01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:38.373
<i>we have Anna Mueller,</i>

01:30:38.374 --> 01:30:40.046
<i>who's already got
the Wimbledon title this year.</i>

01:30:40.047 --> 01:30:41.983
<i>She's been having
a great season.</i>

01:30:41.984 --> 01:30:43.920
<i>Absolutely incredible.</i>

01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:46.590
<i>There just hasn't been
really anyone on the women's side</i>

01:30:46.591 --> 01:30:48.454
<i>who can give her
much of a challenge.</i>

01:30:48.455 --> 01:30:50.227
<i>In the case of Donaldson,
what do you think it is that...</i>

01:31:36.605 --> 01:31:37.808
It's his grandmother's.

01:31:41.344 --> 01:31:42.472
How is she?

01:31:44.115 --> 01:31:45.145
She died.

01:31:46.887 --> 01:31:47.887
Stroke.

01:32:24.255 --> 01:32:25.350
I miss you.

01:32:50.876 --> 01:32:52.711
You're right.

01:32:52.712 --> 01:32:54.150
I do find it disturbing.

01:32:54.151 --> 01:32:55.589
There's no need, man.

01:32:57.192 --> 01:32:58.587
Lots of girls were into me.

01:32:58.588 --> 01:33:00.922
None of them
wanted to marry me.

01:33:00.923 --> 01:33:03.058
- That's not what I was for.
- What were you for?

01:33:19.043 --> 01:33:20.204
<i>You're exactly right, Jason.</i>

01:33:20.205 --> 01:33:22.013
<i>Just to back you up
a little bit...</i>

01:33:22.014 --> 01:33:26.814
<i>His first serve last year was around 130,
which is excellent.</i>

01:33:26.815 --> 01:33:31.614
<i>But now we're seeing him
get up to 135, 140 sometimes,</i>

01:33:31.615 --> 01:33:33.957
<i>it's giving him a lot more
free points when he serves.</i>

01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:36.459
<i>Yeah, it's just
little things like that...</i>

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.423
Art? Mr. Donaldson?

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.730
Oh, my God,
I can't believe my luck

01:33:40.731 --> 01:33:42.860
that I would run
into you so late at night.

01:33:42.861 --> 01:33:44.297
Um, would you, uh...

01:33:45.997 --> 01:33:47.432
Sure, yeah.

01:33:49.068 --> 01:33:50.234
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:33:50.235 --> 01:33:51.400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:33:51.401 --> 01:33:53.206
<i>The edge
over the opponents.</i>

01:33:53.207 --> 01:33:55.775
<i>That's often the difference
between a good player</i>

01:33:55.776 --> 01:33:57.077
<i>and a great player.</i>

01:33:57.078 --> 01:33:59.196
<i>And I think
Donaldson right now is</i>

01:33:59.197 --> 01:34:01.314
<i>starting to look like
a great player.</i>

01:34:01.315 --> 01:34:03.215
<i>That's for sure.
And I'll be very surprised</i>

01:34:03.216 --> 01:34:04.886
<i>if he doesn't
come away tomorrow...</i>

01:34:04.887 --> 01:34:06.752
Honestly,
I thought you'd be happy

01:34:06.753 --> 01:34:08.320
I was in the draw.

01:34:08.321 --> 01:34:11.397
I mean, you always wanted
to beat me in a tournament,

01:34:11.398 --> 01:34:12.926
and a few weeks
before the Open,

01:34:12.927 --> 01:34:14.797
that's the perfect
confidence booster.

01:34:14.798 --> 01:34:16.546
I know what you're
trying to do right now.

01:34:16.547 --> 01:34:18.489
I'm not trying
to do anything, Art.

01:34:18.490 --> 01:34:20.431
This is a challenger.
I don't need to play

01:34:20.432 --> 01:34:22.506
- mind games with you.
- Right. You don't give a shit.

01:34:22.507 --> 01:34:24.535
I... Hey, I didn't say that.

01:34:26.845 --> 01:34:28.775
We both know you have
considerably more

01:34:28.776 --> 01:34:30.310
at stake here than I do.

01:34:31.813 --> 01:34:33.280
Do I?

01:34:36.821 --> 01:34:39.554
What the...
Oh, fuck, where do get

01:34:39.555 --> 01:34:42.287
your swagger from, man?

01:34:42.288 --> 01:34:44.663
I mean, you come in here
swinging your dick around

01:34:44.664 --> 01:34:47.159
like I'm supposed
to be afraid of it, but...

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.467
Do you realize
how embarrassing it is

01:34:49.468 --> 01:34:51.834
that you are here
right now?

01:34:51.835 --> 01:34:53.866
Not quite as embarrassing
as you being here.

01:34:53.867 --> 01:34:55.467
I'm just stopping by, man.

01:34:56.508 --> 01:34:57.909
This is where you live.

01:35:02.215 --> 01:35:04.376
You know...

01:35:04.377 --> 01:35:07.382
I always tried to figure out
what happened to you,

01:35:07.383 --> 01:35:10.388
but, you know, the more
I've thought about it,

01:35:10.389 --> 01:35:12.490
the more I realize...

01:35:12.491 --> 01:35:14.486
It's what didn't happen.

01:35:15.262 --> 01:35:17.060
You never grew up.

01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:19.895
You still think you can talk to me
like you're my peer,

01:35:19.896 --> 01:35:22.396
because we came
from the same place.

01:35:22.397 --> 01:35:25.266
But it's not about where you come from
in tennis, Patrick.

01:35:26.406 --> 01:35:27.406
It's about winning.

01:35:28.374 --> 01:35:30.601
And I do. A lot.

01:35:34.042 --> 01:35:37.047
- You've never beaten me.
- So what?

01:35:37.048 --> 01:35:40.380
I haven't beaten most of the guys
who play at these things.

01:35:40.381 --> 01:35:43.086
This is a game about winning
the points that matter.

01:35:46.117 --> 01:35:47.288
I don't matter?

01:35:51.732 --> 01:35:53.661
Not even to the most
obsessive tennis fan

01:35:53.662 --> 01:35:55.263
in the entire world.

01:35:58.638 --> 01:36:00.069
We're not talking
about tennis.

01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:02.270
What the fuck else do I have
to talk to you about?

01:36:13.219 --> 01:36:15.987
I wanted to come in here
and wish you luck, Art.

01:36:21.725 --> 01:36:23.894
That makes no sense.

01:36:23.895 --> 01:36:25.964
I wanted to say that
I'm looking forward to it.

01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:29.429
And I miss playing with you.

01:36:33.965 --> 01:36:34.965
Yeah.

01:36:37.276 --> 01:36:39.040
Hmm.

01:36:39.041 --> 01:36:42.442
Well, I don't miss
playing with you, man.

01:36:43.483 --> 01:36:44.917
I'm too old for it.

01:36:53.922 --> 01:36:55.520
Kiss for me.

01:36:55.521 --> 01:36:57.120
Thank you. And Grandma.

01:36:57.121 --> 01:36:58.456
Mwah!

01:36:58.457 --> 01:36:59.896
- Thanks, sweetheart
- Good night, honey.

01:36:59.897 --> 01:37:01.992
All right,
tuck you both in.

01:37:01.993 --> 01:37:03.897
Oh, there we go.

01:37:03.898 --> 01:37:05.696
Night, sweetheart.

01:37:11.203 --> 01:37:12.208
Good night.

01:37:14.105 --> 01:37:15.341
Thank you.

01:37:15.342 --> 01:37:16.848
What time you want me
to come get her tomorrow?

01:37:16.849 --> 01:37:19.441
I'm saying, whenever,
whenever you want to

01:37:19.442 --> 01:37:20.609
'cause she can
stay with Andrew

01:37:20.610 --> 01:37:21.945
- while we're doing warm-ups.
- Okay, hon.

01:37:21.946 --> 01:37:23.282
And you're talking
to Ralph in the morning?

01:37:23.283 --> 01:37:24.922
Oh, thank...
Yes, I do. I have that.

01:37:24.923 --> 01:37:27.254
- Okay. Thank you, Mom.
- Okay, sleep tight, okay?

01:37:27.255 --> 01:37:28.752
- I love you.
- I love you, sweetie.

01:37:28.753 --> 01:37:30.463
- Have you... Do you have it?
- Okay, got my key.

01:37:30.464 --> 01:37:32.088
- Yes, I do. Bye-bye.
- Okay.

01:37:32.089 --> 01:37:33.130
Good night.

01:38:26.444 --> 01:38:27.877
Tell me it doesn't matter.

01:38:33.223 --> 01:38:36.358
Tell me it doesn't matter
if I win tomorrow.

01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:41.531
No.

01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:48.271
You tell me if it matters.
You're the professional competitor, Art.

01:38:50.702 --> 01:38:52.605
It can't be about
avoiding my judgment.

01:38:55.376 --> 01:38:56.773
I'm not a nun.
I'm not your mommy.

01:38:56.774 --> 01:38:59.046
I'm just asking that you love me
no matter what.

01:38:59.047 --> 01:39:00.945
What am I, Jesus?

01:39:00.946 --> 01:39:02.054
Yeah.

01:39:08.561 --> 01:39:09.561
You can beat him.

01:39:11.729 --> 01:39:12.889
What if I don't?

01:39:14.393 --> 01:39:15.525
How are you
gonna look at me

01:39:15.526 --> 01:39:17.729
if I still can't beat
Patrick Zweig?

01:39:20.936 --> 01:39:22.107
Just like this.

01:39:34.349 --> 01:39:36.081
I'm going to
say something.

01:39:36.082 --> 01:39:37.815
It's probably gonna
make you angry.

01:39:40.355 --> 01:39:42.259
I need you to
hear me out, okay?

01:39:47.432 --> 01:39:50.795
I wanna retire this year
whether we win the Open or not.

01:39:54.497 --> 01:39:56.042
I'm still going to go for it.

01:39:58.470 --> 01:40:00.178
I'm still going to try, but...

01:40:03.978 --> 01:40:05.183
I'm tired.

01:40:10.190 --> 01:40:12.789
I don't want to be one of those guys
who doesn't know

01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:14.486
when to walk away, okay?

01:40:14.487 --> 01:40:16.286
It's embarrassing
to still be doing this shit

01:40:16.287 --> 01:40:17.459
when you're 40.

01:40:22.303 --> 01:40:23.498
Okay.

01:40:25.735 --> 01:40:28.306
Okay?

01:40:28.307 --> 01:40:30.709
If you wanna quit playing tennis,
you can quit playing tennis.

01:40:30.710 --> 01:40:32.705
You don't need
my permission.

01:40:57.332 --> 01:40:59.464
We've been
doing this together.

01:40:59.465 --> 01:41:01.483
We've always been
doing this together.

01:41:01.484 --> 01:41:03.462
I'm your coach.
Okay, I work for you.

01:41:03.463 --> 01:41:05.441
- Coach me then.
- I am coaching you.

01:41:08.850 --> 01:41:10.875
I'm playing
for both of us, Tashi.

01:41:12.244 --> 01:41:13.548
I know that.

01:41:21.721 --> 01:41:23.558
If you don't win tomorrow,
I'll leave you.

01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:30.670
I'm serious.
Does that help you?

01:43:35.395 --> 01:43:39.496
Can you just hold me
until I fall asleep, please?

01:43:48.432 --> 01:43:49.440
Okay.

01:46:16.351 --> 01:46:18.523
Advantage, Donaldson.

01:46:31.963 --> 01:46:34.173
Game, Donaldson.

01:46:34.174 --> 01:46:37.735
Donaldson leads
six games to five.

01:47:02.132 --> 01:47:05.568
<i>Phil's Tire Town reminds you
to drink some water.</i>

01:47:05.569 --> 01:47:08.034
<i>Beverages are available
at the snack bar.</i>

01:47:24.081 --> 01:47:25.379
What are you doing?

01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:27.100
I told him you're an Uber driver.
Just drive.

01:47:53.077 --> 01:47:54.475
I don't wanna be
parked here long.

01:47:54.476 --> 01:47:55.978
Someone's gonna think
I'm a hooker and call the cops.

01:47:55.979 --> 01:47:57.112
We can go back
to my hotel.

01:47:57.113 --> 01:47:58.496
The money just came in
this afternoon.

01:47:58.497 --> 01:47:59.881
I am not here
to fuck you, Patrick.

01:47:59.882 --> 01:48:00.991
- You're not?
- No.

01:48:00.992 --> 01:48:02.022
Uh.

01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:04.926
Well?

01:48:09.994 --> 01:48:11.629
I want you
to lose tomorrow.

01:48:11.630 --> 01:48:13.000
I'm aware of that.

01:48:16.001 --> 01:48:18.434
I'm asking you
to lose tomorrow.

01:48:26.710 --> 01:48:27.710
Fuck off.

01:48:29.488 --> 01:48:31.815
He's doing really well
this week.

01:48:31.816 --> 01:48:32.917
He's ready to come back.

01:48:32.918 --> 01:48:34.183
He's ready to
make a shot at the Open,

01:48:34.184 --> 01:48:36.104
and if he wins tomorrow,
he'll know he can do it.

01:48:37.228 --> 01:48:38.128
He needs this.

01:48:38.129 --> 01:48:39.995
- He needs this?
- Yes.

01:48:41.794 --> 01:48:43.129
What about what I need?

01:48:45.462 --> 01:48:47.969
I can't believe
you'd do this to him.

01:48:48.842 --> 01:48:49.971
I mean,

01:48:51.168 --> 01:48:52.988
fucking me
would be one thing,

01:48:52.989 --> 01:48:54.808
but this?
This is unforgivable.

01:48:54.809 --> 01:48:56.379
Actually, I'm being
incredibly fucking kind

01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:57.880
to the both of you right now.

01:48:57.881 --> 01:49:00.553
Okay? I'm taking such good care
of my little white boys.

01:49:02.056 --> 01:49:03.849
No. No fucking way.

01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:05.870
Drive me back
to my fucking hotel.

01:49:05.871 --> 01:49:07.890
Drive the fucking car, Patrick.

01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:09.187
Hey, you know what the most
frustrating part of this is?

01:49:09.188 --> 01:49:10.723
- What?
- You know what really drives me crazy?

01:49:10.724 --> 01:49:12.022
You did come here to fuck me,

01:49:12.023 --> 01:49:13.321
but you're so full of shit

01:49:13.322 --> 01:49:15.197
that you won't
even admit that to yourself.

01:49:15.198 --> 01:49:17.918
If it's the only way to get you to throw
the fucking match, then sure.

01:49:18.434 --> 01:49:19.984
Go fuck yourself.

01:49:19.985 --> 01:49:21.443
You absolute loser.

01:49:21.444 --> 01:49:22.901
I'm the loser?

01:49:22.902 --> 01:49:25.139
Yeah. Yeah, you are.
Look at you.

01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:27.540
Time for your Uber driver
to drop you back off to your family.

01:49:41.687 --> 01:49:42.687
Thirty, love.

01:49:45.231 --> 01:49:46.231
Come on, Art.

01:49:51.372 --> 01:49:53.903
- Unbelievable.
- I know. Let's go!

01:50:11.488 --> 01:50:12.658
Fuck it. I'll do it.

01:50:14.922 --> 01:50:16.086
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

01:50:16.087 --> 01:50:17.253
Because I want you
to actually do it,

01:50:17.254 --> 01:50:19.096
so I need to know
that you understand why...

01:50:19.097 --> 01:50:21.194
I'm not married to you, Tashi.
Just be happy I'm doing what you want

01:50:21.195 --> 01:50:23.464
- and shut up about it.
- You are such a fucking child.

01:50:23.465 --> 01:50:25.131
Of course I am.

01:50:25.132 --> 01:50:27.904
I spent my entire life
hitting a ball with a racket.

01:50:29.508 --> 01:50:32.070
Why the fuck
am I in your car?

01:50:32.071 --> 01:50:33.535
- Because you're stupid.
- You're stupid.

01:50:33.536 --> 01:50:36.124
I know. I'm just not
as disturbed by it as you are.

01:50:36.125 --> 01:50:38.713
I don't have nearly that
high an opinion of myself.

01:50:38.714 --> 01:50:40.309
You are the most
egotistical person

01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:42.195
- I have ever met in my life.
- Oh, sure, sure.

01:50:42.196 --> 01:50:44.081
But I've never been
confused about the fact

01:50:44.082 --> 01:50:45.785
that I'm a piece of shit.

01:50:45.786 --> 01:50:47.002
That's what you like
about me.

01:50:47.003 --> 01:50:48.218
I don't like
anything about you.

01:50:48.219 --> 01:50:49.654
No, you like precisely
one thing about me

01:50:49.655 --> 01:50:51.090
and it's that
I'm such a piece of shit

01:50:51.091 --> 01:50:52.922
that I could actually see you
for what you are.

01:50:52.923 --> 01:50:54.861
And what is that?

01:50:54.862 --> 01:50:56.801
In reality? A really,

01:50:58.668 --> 01:51:00.495
really insanely hot woman.

01:51:00.496 --> 01:51:03.267
- Oh, fuck off.
- I guess now you'd say a MILF.

01:51:03.268 --> 01:51:05.003
- Pull over.
- Come on, don't be dramatic.

01:51:05.004 --> 01:51:06.590
Pull the fucking
car over, Patrick.

01:51:06.591 --> 01:51:08.178
- Fine, let me... Fine.
- Pull over.

01:51:18.117 --> 01:51:21.185
Hey! Hey!
Your hotel's that way!

01:51:39.304 --> 01:51:41.406
Are you gonna
hit me again, huh?

01:55:06.513 --> 01:55:08.448
<i>I miss
watching you play, Tashi.</i>

01:55:09.918 --> 01:55:11.550
<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

01:55:14.291 --> 01:55:16.720
You have to make him feel
like he earned it tomorrow.

01:55:19.065 --> 01:55:21.395
You can't just give up
in the middle of the match.

01:55:24.595 --> 01:55:26.532
Are you sure
this is what you want?

01:55:30.367 --> 01:55:31.801
What else could I want?

01:55:41.417 --> 01:55:43.780
How am I supposed to know
if you're going to do it?

01:55:46.491 --> 01:55:47.652
You won't.

01:56:03.138 --> 01:56:04.540
- All right.
- Come on!

01:56:38.639 --> 01:56:40.719
Thirty, forty.

01:56:48.956 --> 01:56:50.880
- All right.
- Hang in there.

01:56:52.382 --> 01:56:53.520
Let's go!

01:56:55.725 --> 01:56:58.124
- Yes, that's it, that's it!
- Come on, Patrick.

01:56:58.125 --> 01:56:59.995
Yes, yes, the deuce!

01:56:59.996 --> 01:57:01.436
- All right!
- Yes!

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:23.584
Donaldson! Let's go!

01:57:23.585 --> 01:57:25.689
Blame it on the court!

01:57:25.690 --> 01:57:27.587
Whoo!

01:57:54.514 --> 01:57:56.178
Fault!

01:58:02.752 --> 01:58:04.228
Come on, get back in it.

01:58:07.359 --> 01:58:10.102
No! Zweig!

01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:23.148
- Come on!
- Whoo, whoo!

01:58:55.609 --> 01:58:57.743
Come on, Patrick, let's play!

01:59:32.876 --> 01:59:35.331
Time violation.
Warning, Zweig.

02:00:53.699 --> 02:00:54.862
Deuce!

02:01:32.268 --> 02:01:34.339
Fuck off!

02:01:35.769 --> 02:01:38.238
Code violation,
audible obscenity.

02:01:38.239 --> 02:01:40.345
Point penalty, Donaldson.

02:01:41.409 --> 02:01:42.743
Advantage, Zweig.

02:02:12.810 --> 02:02:13.972
Art?

02:02:18.675 --> 02:02:20.044
He can serve.

02:02:20.977 --> 02:02:22.578
You need to
get into position.

02:02:26.126 --> 02:02:27.854
Come on, Art.
Let's go!

02:02:40.635 --> 02:02:42.473
Serve.

02:03:02.857 --> 02:03:04.924
Game, Zweig.

02:03:05.998 --> 02:03:07.993
Final set, tie break.

02:03:15.768 --> 02:03:17.131
Come on,
let's do this.

02:03:17.132 --> 02:03:20.236
Let's close it out.
Let's close it out, baby.

02:06:55.488 --> 02:06:56.958
Come on!

02:06:59.999 --> 02:07:01.424
Ah!
