00:39.581 --> 00:42.286
- Yo.
- Yo.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.746
What up?

00:43.961 --> 00:45.075
Damn, bitch.

00:49.925 --> 00:53.709
- You got something for me?
- Yeah. Yeah, I found them.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.849
- Is this a five or an S?
- Five, yo.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.936
No, wait. S.

01:04.147 --> 01:08.015
- No, no. Yeah, five.
- Yeah?

01:09.361 --> 01:13.193
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.438
Hey, man.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.694
I'm slinging mad volume
and fat stacking Benjies.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.663
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.367
Hey.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.291
So they got names?

01:24.501 --> 01:28.748
Hers is, like, I don't know.
She's just his woman is all.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.838
Him, they call Spooge.

01:32.217 --> 01:36.262
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

01:36.471 --> 01:38.381
Let me get this straight.
You got jacked...

01:38.599 --> 01:40.556
...by a guy named Spooge?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.392
Yo, what's his name matter?

01:42.603 --> 01:46.185
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

01:46.398 --> 01:49.019
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing...

01:49.234 --> 01:51.393
- Did I say that?
- Because I'll go do it myself.

01:51.612 --> 01:55.905
- It's just I'm on probation and all.
- Yeah.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.776
So you gonna do it?

01:59.912 --> 02:01.287
Yeah.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.738
Good. Right on.

02:05.959 --> 02:10.171
Because these two,
they need to get got.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.554
Where's my money, bitch?
Where's my money?

03:43.765 --> 03:45.639
Where's my...?

03:45.851 --> 03:50.679
Where's my money, bitch?
Huh, bitch?

03:50.898 --> 03:54.017
Where's my money, bitch?
Oh, that's good.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.812
Where's my money?

03:56.028 --> 03:58.435
Where's my money, bitch?
Bitch, where's my money?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.778
Come on.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.622
I will mess you up.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.785
That how you wanna play this?
Your call.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.539
Your funeral, jack.

04:13.754 --> 04:19.543
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.547
Yeah, mucho loco.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.883
Do not test me.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.027
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:38.237 --> 04:40.988
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.481
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.275
Looks like it's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

04:47.496 --> 04:50.532
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

04:50.749 --> 04:54.877
- You have a great day.
- Right on. You too.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.555
God. Shit.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.757
Yo, anybody home?

05:54.563 --> 05:55.594
Hello?

06:50.994 --> 06:56.949
Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery...

06:57.167 --> 06:59.409
...tonight in the steel knockout.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.545
Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.081
That's 15 easy installments.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.301
And, folks, the knockout is only...

07:08.512 --> 07:11.264
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

07:11.473 --> 07:14.047
Now, Terry put this one together...

07:14.268 --> 07:16.841
Where's your folks? They here?

07:17.062 --> 07:18.971
...and I'm here to tell you...

07:19.189 --> 07:24.350
Yeah, guys,
you might wanna put up like a...

07:25.153 --> 07:26.398
Already done it.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.736
Tonight, folks...

07:37.124 --> 07:39.081
Do you realize how long it's been...

07:39.293 --> 07:43.871
...since we've offered this sword
in this set?

07:44.089 --> 07:50.424
Much less the watashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.297
It's no wonder...

07:52.514 --> 07:55.599
It is no wonder so many of you
are on the line right now...

07:55.809 --> 07:56.924
What's your name?

07:57.144 --> 08:00.429
I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm...

08:00.647 --> 08:04.099
My name's Diesel.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.275
...eleven, 12, 13...

08:07.696 --> 08:10.614
...sixteen, 17, 18, 19...

08:10.824 --> 08:13.362
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

08:13.577 --> 08:17.195
Like, I don't know, Mister Rogers'?

08:17.414 --> 08:21.578
Imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.747
Folks, custom pieces...

08:30.177 --> 08:34.388
Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess...

08:34.598 --> 08:36.840
...but there's a reason for that.

08:37.059 --> 08:42.301
Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.

08:42.523 --> 08:46.141
These knives possess edges like...

08:54.743 --> 08:59.239
So when are your folks
coming home?

08:59.456 --> 09:03.833
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

09:06.338 --> 09:08.663
I'm hungry.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.845
Hey there, you three.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.843
Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.

09:19.059 --> 09:24.017
We'll be thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences...

09:24.231 --> 09:27.351
Okay, that's all I officially
remembered. Good luck.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.403
Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.444
Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz...

09:36.660 --> 09:38.700
...calling to say hello.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.032
I'm down from Santa Fe today
and I was thinking about you both...

09:42.249 --> 09:43.494
...hoping everything's well.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.793
I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected...

09:47.004 --> 09:49.495
...so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.873
Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.718
- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Gretchen.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.382
This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?

10:00.601 --> 10:02.724
No. No, not at all.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.392
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

10:05.606 --> 10:06.981
We're very well, thank you.

10:07.858 --> 10:11.690
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work...

10:11.904 --> 10:15.237
...and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.323
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.488
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.079
That's wonderful.

10:22.289 --> 10:27.117
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this...

10:27.336 --> 10:31.250
...and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.707
I mean, he's been so adamant...

10:33.926 --> 10:37.591
...about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and...

10:37.804 --> 10:40.592
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just...

10:41.517 --> 10:46.225
- What? What is it?
- I can't...

10:46.438 --> 10:49.937
...begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.402
The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just...

10:56.156 --> 10:58.232
It saved us.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.320
I don't know if I...

11:03.539 --> 11:06.290
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

11:06.500 --> 11:08.706
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

11:08.919 --> 11:12.370
To me. And to all of us.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.259
So I just...

11:15.467 --> 11:19.714
...finally wanted to say thank you.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.720
Anyway...

11:27.271 --> 11:28.350
End of speech.

11:28.564 --> 11:31.233
So I do...
I hope we get to see you soon.

11:31.441 --> 11:36.317
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

11:37.322 --> 11:41.367
- How about this afternoon?
- Yeah, okay.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.657
Monoalkenes, diolefins...

11:47.875 --> 11:51.457
...trienes, polyenes.

11:51.670 --> 11:55.121
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.380
But when you start
to feel overwhelmed...

11:57.593 --> 11:59.834
...and you will...

12:00.053 --> 12:04.181
...just keep in mind
that one element...

12:04.391 --> 12:06.633
...carbon.

12:06.852 --> 12:10.351
Carbon is at the center of it all.

12:10.564 --> 12:14.312
There is no life without carbon.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.017
Nowhere that we know of
in the universe.

12:17.237 --> 12:24.154
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

12:25.996 --> 12:26.992
Carmen is carbon.

12:27.873 --> 12:32.167
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

12:33.504 --> 12:35.377
No. Okay.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.999
I like to think of it...

12:40.052 --> 12:43.503
I like to think that the diamond...

12:43.722 --> 12:45.762
...and the woman
who wears it on her finger...

12:45.974 --> 12:49.178
...are both formed
from the same stuff.

12:50.437 --> 12:55.348
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.893
That got your attention, right?

12:59.112 --> 13:02.813
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

13:04.159 --> 13:08.109
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

13:09.331 --> 13:13.245
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process...

13:13.460 --> 13:15.868
...for making synthetic diamonds.

13:16.088 --> 13:18.246
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.

13:18.465 --> 13:23.626
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling...

13:23.846 --> 13:28.554
...electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

13:28.767 --> 13:32.350
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

13:32.563 --> 13:37.521
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

13:40.445 --> 13:44.942
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

13:46.493 --> 13:50.443
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.592
Anyway...

14:04.511 --> 14:07.927
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper...

14:08.140 --> 14:09.682
...paid to a carbon-based man...

14:09.892 --> 14:15.562
...for something
he made out of carbon.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.268
It's so nice to have you back with us.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.315
You're looking great, by the way.

14:23.530 --> 14:28.026
A little skinnier,
which is definitely no tragedy.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.493
- And then there's the hair thing.
- I actually like that.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.994
That's a great look for you.

14:35.459 --> 14:41.414
- But you're feeling good?
- Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.790
It's...

14:44.009 --> 14:45.468
I'm glad to be back at work.

14:45.677 --> 14:50.553
I'm glad to... You know,
I'm happy to be here. Really.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.758
We're happy too.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.641
And I just...

14:58.524 --> 15:02.817
Yeah. It's good. It's great.

15:06.365 --> 15:09.864
Is everything okay?

15:10.869 --> 15:16.243
Just please feel comfortable
coming to me...

15:16.458 --> 15:21.203
...with any problems, any issues.
Anything at all.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.339
You know, completely confidential.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.459
Okay?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.716
- See you tomorrow, Flynn.
- See you, Jeffrey.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.474
Oh, man.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.902
Let me see it.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.988
- Dad, let me see it.
- Don't worry about it.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.545
Hey, let's go.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.615
Forty-eight dollars,
that's the original price...

16:41.919 --> 16:42.950
Hey.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.078
Peekaboo.

16:51.553 --> 16:52.632
No?

16:57.643 --> 16:59.053
Peekaboo.

17:03.357 --> 17:04.637
Oh, man.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.813
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

17:12.199 --> 17:14.904
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

17:15.744 --> 17:18.496
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching...

17:18.705 --> 17:21.576
...I gave you advice,
take it or leave it.

17:23.502 --> 17:29.789
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.762
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

17:44.982 --> 17:47.389
- You shut up, you...
- You shut up!

17:47.609 --> 17:50.314
- You're the one who dropped it.
- I didn't drop it.

17:50.529 --> 17:51.525
I didn't drop...

17:51.738 --> 17:53.945
- Shit! You dropped it.
- Shut the hell up about it.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.533
- You shut up!
- You shut up.

17:59.663 --> 18:01.205
Get up.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.867
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

18:26.106 --> 18:30.519
- You know who might have done it?
- I have an idea.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.897
Well, here's what I think.

18:36.116 --> 18:40.577
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads...

18:40.787 --> 18:45.948
...we tie them up, drive them way out
into the desert, strip them naked...

18:46.168 --> 18:51.542
...then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

18:52.758 --> 18:55.213
Saw it in an old Western.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.299
You with me?

19:03.268 --> 19:05.427
Scorpions?

19:07.981 --> 19:10.603
Scorpions are good.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.900
Yeah.

19:20.536 --> 19:21.781
Nice.

19:35.467 --> 19:39.465
Damn, Dad. Check it out.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.253
Who is this?

20:01.285 --> 20:04.155
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.494
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.079
- Mom.
- What? I'm just offering the choice.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.784
This is Mrs. Schwartz,
whom you've heard so much about.

20:12.004 --> 20:14.958
- Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
- Nice to meet you too.

20:15.174 --> 20:16.336
Oh, Walt.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.962
Look who's here.

20:20.179 --> 20:21.174
- Gretchen.
- Hi.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.424
Always nice to see you.
What a nice surprise.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.179
Look at you. You're looking good.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.387
Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

20:29.605 --> 20:31.099
I know it was for me.

20:31.315 --> 20:34.897
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.485
- May I?
- Oh, sure.

20:36.695 --> 20:39.898
- For good luck, right?
- Exactly. Here's hoping.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.740
- We could use some of that.
- Yeah.

20:41.950 --> 20:46.197
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

20:47.414 --> 20:52.206
- It was a really good thing.
- You're very welcome.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.539
- We're gonna find a way to repay you.
- No, no, no.

20:55.756 --> 20:58.876
We don't wanna ever hear that.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.214
You know, I hate to say it...

21:03.430 --> 21:06.550
...but I really need to get going.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.391
Oh, that's too bad.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.641
- You can't stay for dinner?
- I wish I could...

21:10.854 --> 21:14.188
...but unfortunately,
I have to try to beat the traffic.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.395
Okay. Okay.

21:15.609 --> 21:20.401
Well, I hope we get a chance
to catch up real soon.

21:20.614 --> 21:21.894
Yeah, hopefully.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.951
Gretchen, your purse.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.027
Well, good to see you.

21:29.748 --> 21:33.995
And you and Elliott
are welcome anytime. Really.

21:35.045 --> 21:38.496
And I, for one, am gonna be
much better about keeping in touch.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.838
- It's so good to see you.
- And you.

21:41.051 --> 21:44.965
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

21:45.180 --> 21:49.048
- Okay. Bye, now.
- Drive safely.

21:50.644 --> 21:53.680
You know, what am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.724
I'll be right back.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.236
Gretchen.

22:02.239 --> 22:03.235
Hey.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.777
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.824
What did you...?

22:15.377 --> 22:17.204
We need to talk.

22:17.421 --> 22:21.465
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

22:22.718 --> 22:25.719
Please. Please.

22:39.943 --> 22:44.570
Where's my money, bitch?
I ain't gonna keep asking nice!

22:44.781 --> 22:48.910
Yo, all right? I want my money
and my dope. Come on!

22:49.119 --> 22:52.453
- I just wanna say, man...
- What? What do you wanna say?

22:52.664 --> 22:54.159
I just wanna go on record, man.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.743
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.250
- Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
- Shut up!

23:00.464 --> 23:02.255
Jesus.

23:02.466 --> 23:05.799
- Serious, I might have a concussion.
- Don't fall asleep, baby.

23:06.011 --> 23:07.920
- Subdural hematoma.
- Don't fall asleep.

23:08.138 --> 23:10.676
Shut up.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.011
All right. Empty your pockets.

23:13.227 --> 23:15.599
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.011
Do it!

23:21.985 --> 23:23.527
All right, turn around.

23:23.737 --> 23:24.982
Turn around.

23:25.489 --> 23:27.778
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

23:32.829 --> 23:36.530
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

23:50.097 --> 23:52.006
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any...

23:52.224 --> 23:53.884
- We shot it all.
- Yeah?

23:54.518 --> 23:57.388
- Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
- Yeah.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.727
All right, tell you what.

23:59.940 --> 24:03.724
Both of you
pull it out of your butts right now...

24:03.944 --> 24:07.894
...or I grab a flashlight and
some pliers and go exploring.

24:08.115 --> 24:10.024
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.245
There you go.

24:18.125 --> 24:20.450
All right, come on.
On the table.

24:21.378 --> 24:24.664
All right, so, what, you hold the
crystal and she holds the H, huh?

24:24.882 --> 24:25.913
Division of labor.

24:27.593 --> 24:31.293
All right,
there's maybe an 8 ball here.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.589
Where's the rest of my meth?

24:33.807 --> 24:36.215
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

24:36.435 --> 24:38.309
- You shut up.
- You shut up, skank.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.355
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

24:41.857 --> 24:45.226
This really isn't getting any better,
man. It's turning cranial.

24:45.444 --> 24:48.943
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

24:49.156 --> 24:52.323
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial...

24:52.534 --> 24:55.321
...for being such a pussy.

24:57.831 --> 25:01.283
Hey. Hey, baby.

25:01.502 --> 25:05.369
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.337
All right.

25:12.554 --> 25:15.970
You two are never
getting high again.

25:16.183 --> 25:18.756
I will make it my life's mission.

25:18.977 --> 25:21.647
Not another needle,
not another ball...

25:21.855 --> 25:25.900
...not one toke,
not till I get what's mine.

25:28.278 --> 25:30.152
Yeah, we got you covered,
man, sure.

25:30.364 --> 25:33.530
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

25:33.742 --> 25:35.236
You're damn right, plus interest.

25:35.452 --> 25:37.943
- Where?
- Back yard.

25:38.163 --> 25:40.785
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Back yard. Go check it out.

25:40.999 --> 25:44.166
- Hurting. Painful.
- Hey, hey, hey.

25:44.378 --> 25:48.078
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

25:48.298 --> 25:51.299
Hey, don't move.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.340
Come on.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.012
See?

26:00.227 --> 26:03.477
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

26:03.689 --> 26:06.524
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.525
What am I supposed to do with this?

26:08.735 --> 26:11.689
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.194
Get high.

26:18.495 --> 26:20.073
Yo, that's my bank.

26:20.289 --> 26:22.495
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.199
It's a victimless crime.

26:25.919 --> 26:26.950
Where did you get this?

26:28.380 --> 26:29.459
Bodega. Way across town.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.164
In, out, like, bam.
Went smooth as silk, yo.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.677
What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumb-ass?

26:35.888 --> 26:38.046
We roll like the breeze, for real.

26:38.265 --> 26:40.590
All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.

26:40.809 --> 26:43.051
- Nobody even noticed.
- Nobody noticed?

26:43.270 --> 26:47.932
- For real?
- I'm telling you, victimless crime.

26:58.202 --> 27:00.159
Oh, my God.

27:01.747 --> 27:04.238
Jesus. Come on already.

27:04.458 --> 27:07.909
- It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
- You don't know what you're doing.

27:08.128 --> 27:10.536
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

27:10.756 --> 27:12.914
Yeah. Boosted.

27:13.133 --> 27:15.090
It's not like he ever got one open.

27:15.302 --> 27:17.093
At least I got persistence.

27:17.304 --> 27:20.175
The law of averages,
lucky number seven.

27:20.390 --> 27:24.933
- Don't listen to that skank.
- Stop calling me that.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.230
I ain't no skank!

27:27.439 --> 27:29.764
- Skank, skank, skank...
- Hey, hey, hey.

27:29.983 --> 27:31.478
Sit, sit.

27:31.693 --> 27:35.773
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

27:36.615 --> 27:38.572
Now, chill.

27:39.159 --> 27:42.077
You, get that thing open.

27:42.287 --> 27:46.451
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

27:50.921 --> 27:52.914
Where's the kid?

27:54.508 --> 27:55.967
The kid. The little kid!

27:56.176 --> 27:59.130
What are you asking me for?

28:15.404 --> 28:18.986
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.444
Didn't see that coming, huh?

28:25.163 --> 28:26.444
What kind of mother are you?

28:27.875 --> 28:31.374
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

28:31.587 --> 28:34.125
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

28:34.339 --> 28:37.009
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

28:37.217 --> 28:38.676
Are you serious?

28:38.886 --> 28:42.005
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

28:42.222 --> 28:43.598
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, Diesel...

28:43.807 --> 28:46.678
...this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

28:48.854 --> 28:50.265
Get out of the way.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.098
Get out of the way!

29:08.957 --> 29:10.333
So you didn't tell anyone.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.911
- You didn't tell Elliott.
- Not yet.

29:14.713 --> 29:18.378
- Well, what does that mean?
- That means exactly what it means.

29:18.592 --> 29:21.878
That's a determination
I have yet to make.

29:24.556 --> 29:27.890
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

29:28.101 --> 29:29.216
All right.

29:29.436 --> 29:34.727
First let me say, I very much
regret involving you in this.

29:34.942 --> 29:36.899
This was...

29:37.110 --> 29:40.942
This entire thing was unfortunate.

29:41.156 --> 29:43.398
Unfortunate?

29:44.785 --> 29:47.951
And I apologise deeply.

29:48.539 --> 29:50.081
Thank you.

29:51.625 --> 29:54.911
Now please tell me why you did it.

29:56.672 --> 30:00.504
That's not really at issue here.

30:00.843 --> 30:04.757
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

30:06.932 --> 30:10.099
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it...

30:10.310 --> 30:11.769
...how are you paying for it?

30:11.979 --> 30:16.724
This is not an issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

30:17.359 --> 30:20.111
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.025
You tell your wife and son...

30:23.240 --> 30:25.446
...that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

30:25.659 --> 30:28.280
Why are you doing this?

30:30.080 --> 30:32.951
I will clear this up with them.

30:33.166 --> 30:36.370
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...

30:36.587 --> 30:38.211
...thanking me for saving your life.

30:38.422 --> 30:42.502
- Why would you do that to her?
- As I said, I will clear this up.

30:42.718 --> 30:47.427
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

30:47.639 --> 30:48.635
All right?

30:48.849 --> 30:51.470
I will explain
the whole thing to them.

30:51.685 --> 30:54.141
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

30:57.065 --> 30:59.391
I don't owe you an explanation.

30:59.610 --> 31:03.228
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologized.

31:03.447 --> 31:06.234
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

31:06.450 --> 31:09.404
There. I've apologized twice now.

31:09.620 --> 31:12.490
I'm humbly sorry.

31:12.706 --> 31:14.165
Three times.

31:14.374 --> 31:16.332
Let me just get this straight.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.915
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment...

31:19.129 --> 31:20.588
...no strings attached.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.004
An offer which still stands,
by the way.

31:23.217 --> 31:25.886
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever...

31:26.094 --> 31:30.507
...and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

31:30.724 --> 31:32.551
Without our knowledge,
against our will...

31:32.768 --> 31:34.760
...you involve us in your lie.

31:34.978 --> 31:40.851
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

31:42.861 --> 31:46.811
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of it.

31:49.326 --> 31:51.698
What happened to you?

31:54.581 --> 31:56.704
Really, Walt.

31:56.917 --> 31:58.708
What happened?

31:58.919 --> 32:01.706
Because this isn't you.

32:04.758 --> 32:08.626
What would you know about me,
Gretchen?

32:08.846 --> 32:13.258
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

32:13.475 --> 32:15.800
That I should go begging
for your charity?

32:16.520 --> 32:19.853
And you waving
your checkbook around...

32:20.065 --> 32:23.600
...like some magic wand
is gonna make me forget...

32:23.819 --> 32:24.933
...how you and Elliott...

32:25.153 --> 32:28.238
How you and Elliott cut me out?

32:28.448 --> 32:30.240
What? That can't be how you see it.

32:30.450 --> 32:33.902
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

32:34.121 --> 32:36.030
That cannot be how you see it.

32:36.248 --> 32:38.157
- Good. That's beautifully done.
- You left...

32:38.375 --> 32:40.166
You are always
the picture of innocence.

32:40.377 --> 32:42.915
- You left me.
- The picture of innocence.

32:43.130 --> 32:46.665
- Just sweetness and light.
- You left me.

32:47.467 --> 32:48.748
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

32:48.969 --> 32:52.089
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room...

32:52.306 --> 32:54.879
...and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.769
What? Did I dream all of that?

32:57.978 --> 33:00.469
That's your excuse...

33:00.689 --> 33:03.476
...to build your little empire
on my work?

33:03.692 --> 33:05.934
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

33:06.153 --> 33:09.189
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

33:09.406 --> 33:12.111
Little rich girl
just adding to your millions.

33:16.538 --> 33:20.121
I don't even know what to say to you.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.871
I don't even know where to begin.

33:29.176 --> 33:34.515
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.638
Fuck you.

34:15.264 --> 34:17.173
Hey.

34:20.227 --> 34:23.762
Hey, little man, you hungry?

34:37.578 --> 34:39.120
Hey.

35:01.935 --> 35:04.806
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

35:06.648 --> 35:07.680
No, what are you doing?

35:10.110 --> 35:12.103
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

35:12.321 --> 35:13.981
Baby, get up and help me.

35:14.198 --> 35:17.732
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.860
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

35:23.749 --> 35:24.828
Bedtime.

35:28.587 --> 35:31.125
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

35:35.928 --> 35:38.763
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

35:38.972 --> 35:40.846
Is that you? You're the big man?

35:41.058 --> 35:43.727
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

35:43.936 --> 35:46.557
Try and hit me now, bitch.

36:18.303 --> 36:19.584
Oh, hey.

36:19.805 --> 36:22.212
Should I ask where you've been?

36:23.350 --> 36:25.058
Never mind.

36:25.269 --> 36:28.270
We're long past that, I suppose.

36:29.356 --> 36:31.183
Skyler.

36:37.322 --> 36:40.738
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

36:51.170 --> 36:52.829
Walt.

36:53.714 --> 36:56.002
We need to talk.

37:07.769 --> 37:09.643
Just say it.

37:19.448 --> 37:22.318
They're cutting off the money.

37:34.087 --> 37:37.041
What did she say, exactly?

37:39.343 --> 37:44.384
Not much. It was abrupt.

37:44.598 --> 37:48.430
She said something like:

37:49.937 --> 37:53.851
"I'm sorry to have to do this...

37:54.066 --> 37:58.644
...but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

37:58.862 --> 38:01.947
I wish you the very best."

38:03.700 --> 38:05.989
And that was it.

38:11.667 --> 38:13.244
Yeah.

38:13.919 --> 38:18.166
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

38:18.382 --> 38:20.291
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

38:20.509 --> 38:23.000
I was so stunned, but...

38:23.220 --> 38:28.131
I called her back
and she didn't pick up.

38:34.106 --> 38:39.349
So, what do you know about this?

38:42.030 --> 38:47.107
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon...

38:47.327 --> 38:50.946
...and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave...

38:51.164 --> 38:54.450
...and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

38:58.505 --> 39:00.249
Walt.

39:00.924 --> 39:02.964
What do you know that I don't?

39:07.931 --> 39:10.303
Where were you tonight?

39:12.269 --> 39:13.763
I drove up to Santa Fe.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.685
I was with Gretchen.

39:17.900 --> 39:21.150
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

39:22.237 --> 39:26.899
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

39:27.117 --> 39:29.988
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

39:30.204 --> 39:33.323
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing...

39:33.540 --> 39:35.414
...and beating around the bush...

39:35.626 --> 39:39.493
Okay, what...? Tell us what?

39:41.256 --> 39:43.000
Well...

39:44.968 --> 39:46.000
There was a lot of...

39:47.304 --> 39:49.676
...business phraseology
being tossed around.

39:49.890 --> 39:55.430
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"...

39:55.646 --> 39:57.603
..."quarterly decline,"
yadda, yadda, yadda.

39:57.814 --> 40:02.144
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion...

40:06.073 --> 40:07.615
They're broke.

40:08.408 --> 40:11.196
- You are kidding me.
- No.

40:11.912 --> 40:14.782
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

40:14.998 --> 40:19.625
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and...

40:19.837 --> 40:22.506
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...

40:22.714 --> 40:26.546
...is no more immune
than anyone else.

40:27.928 --> 40:29.588
That is...

40:31.348 --> 40:33.471
Jesus, that's...

40:36.937 --> 40:38.217
Yeah.

40:48.448 --> 40:54.569
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

40:57.165 --> 40:59.739
Well, they're prideful people.

41:02.379 --> 41:04.004
Listen.

41:05.674 --> 41:07.714
Not to sound selfish...

41:08.552 --> 41:10.924
...but as far as we go...

41:11.138 --> 41:14.589
...we'll get through this, okay?

41:15.142 --> 41:21.560
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

41:22.232 --> 41:23.263
Hey.

41:27.404 --> 41:32.066
We're gonna make it. All right?
I promise.

41:32.284 --> 41:34.241
Okay.

41:44.922 --> 41:46.831
And yet...

41:48.175 --> 41:51.176
...she still drives a Bentley.

41:56.266 --> 42:00.478
Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

42:12.866 --> 42:15.820
Baby, that don't make any sense.

42:16.036 --> 42:19.737
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

42:19.957 --> 42:22.744
You're designing a safe, where
you gonna put your weak spot?

42:22.960 --> 42:24.418
Nowhere.

42:24.628 --> 42:27.545
I'd make it, like, strong.

42:27.756 --> 42:29.832
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

42:30.050 --> 42:32.173
You put your weak spot
on the bottom.

42:32.386 --> 42:37.095
Oh, baby,
that H is bringing me down.

42:37.307 --> 42:39.596
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

42:39.810 --> 42:42.811
I need to... I need to even out.

42:43.021 --> 42:46.225
- Let me get a hit of that crystal.
- Hell, no. You lost your share.

42:46.441 --> 42:47.722
Come on, baby.

42:47.943 --> 42:50.944
It's all I need, just a little hit.

42:51.154 --> 42:55.069
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

42:55.284 --> 42:57.110
I ain't no skank.

42:57.953 --> 43:01.701
I would appreciate an apology.

43:05.419 --> 43:06.450
What?

43:06.670 --> 43:09.375
I am trying to take
the high road here.

43:09.590 --> 43:10.918
Are you gonna do right?

43:11.133 --> 43:12.212
Listen to me, stupid.

43:12.426 --> 43:15.925
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

43:16.138 --> 43:19.886
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole...

43:20.100 --> 43:23.599
...and assist me and shut up.

43:27.024 --> 43:29.230
I ain't no skank.

43:29.443 --> 43:31.400
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.

43:31.987 --> 43:35.071
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.

43:35.741 --> 43:37.069
You listening to me, skank?

43:37.659 --> 43:38.940
You hear me, skank?

43:39.161 --> 43:43.241
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

43:43.457 --> 43:47.324
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.

43:47.544 --> 43:50.711
I ain't no skank.

43:51.089 --> 43:53.497
No, no, no. Don't. No.

44:09.775 --> 44:12.610
I ain't no skank.

45:12.629 --> 45:13.661
911.

45:26.810 --> 45:29.432
Hey, hey.
Hey, you remember peekaboo?

45:29.646 --> 45:32.850
Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

45:33.066 --> 45:35.771
You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

45:35.986 --> 45:38.192
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

45:38.405 --> 45:41.856
It's a little game
we're gonna play, okay?

45:54.296 --> 45:56.205
Here you go.

45:56.423 --> 46:01.050
Hey. Hey, look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

46:01.261 --> 46:04.879
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and...

46:06.099 --> 46:09.883
Look, just...
Just don't go back inside. All right?

46:10.103 --> 46:13.021
You stay right here. Okay?

46:19.905 --> 46:23.523
You have a good
rest of your life, kid.
