00:36.662 --> 00:38.535
Skyler, I'm so...

00:38.747 --> 00:42.531
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?

00:44.086 --> 00:47.289
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.756
Is she beautiful?

00:52.219 --> 00:57.558
Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.344
Some accident up ahead.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.476
Christ! Today of all days, huh?

01:02.688 --> 01:07.646
No, no, no. Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:08.694 --> 01:09.725
Thank you.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.579
Excuse me. Skyler White?

01:26.795 --> 01:29.251
- 307.
- Thank you.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.056
Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just...

01:43.270 --> 01:44.930
Are you okay?

01:48.150 --> 01:50.439
Meet your daughter.

02:01.288 --> 02:04.953
Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.124
Congratulations, Walt.

02:09.338 --> 02:13.122
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you here.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.915
Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.

02:16.136 --> 02:20.679
I mean, this little bundle of joy
of ours was practically on rails.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.429
Halfway here I thought
he was gonna have to pull over...

02:23.644 --> 02:25.470
...and deliver her himself.

02:27.064 --> 02:31.642
Well, that...
I'm glad it didn't come to that.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.726
Yeah. Thanks, Ted.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.278
No problem at all.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.279
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can...

02:39.493 --> 02:42.447
You three can be alone, okay?

02:42.663 --> 02:45.284
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

02:45.916 --> 02:49.166
- I really can't begin to thank you.
- Don't think anything of it.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.335
It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.

02:51.547 --> 02:52.957
- Thank you.
- She's beautiful.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.667
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.164
Okay. Take care.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.630
Bye.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.683
Are you okay?

03:08.897 --> 03:10.724
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is okay.

03:10.941 --> 03:14.357
I just wish you'd been here.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.522
- Where's everyone else?
- Downstairs.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.402
Hank and Marie
took Junior for dinner.

03:22.619 --> 03:26.831
He has been such a trouper.
He even changed his first diaper.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.950
- No.
- Yeah.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.539
Did he?

03:35.048 --> 03:37.456
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

03:37.676 --> 03:40.001
- Anything at all?
- Actually, yes.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.794
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.719
I just think you get it in your head,
C-section. You know?

03:45.934 --> 03:49.718
But I'm just so glad,
the way it all worked out.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.268
Doing it natural instead.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.724
It just couldn't have gone any better.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.437
Good.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.902
Let me go get your things.

04:04.786 --> 04:08.487
And I'll get my stuff too, okay?

04:08.707 --> 04:10.249
- I'll spend the night.
- Okay.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.596
Dad.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.427
I was in the shower, hey.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.510
I overslept.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.470
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.226
Yeah.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.607
Baby, I gotta go.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.117
Okay.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.467
Somebody broke in.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.255
Okay.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.235
Oh, no. No, no, no!

06:47.199 --> 06:48.776
Come on.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.867
Damn.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.282
Oh, God.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.582
Oh, Christ.

07:03.549 --> 07:04.877
This week was tough.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.503
Toughest yet.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.885
You know why?
I knew this day was coming.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.469
- My birthday.
- Your re-birthday?

07:12.683 --> 07:14.675
Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.720
I was scared shitless
I wouldn't make it.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.348
I really didn't think I would.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.889
Called in sick three days in a row.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.065
I know my boss was pissed.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.278
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't wanna see anybody.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.603
You guys know how that is.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.734
All it would take is one friend...

07:29.950 --> 07:32.619
...and I'd be out
ripping and running again.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.951
But I made it. I really made it.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.117
I got one year clean to the day.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.811
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

08:03.025 --> 08:06.109
- You getting enough sleep?
- Actually, no.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.820
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

08:10.032 --> 08:12.487
- Yeah?
- A guy wants his whole back done up.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.274
Him on his chopper with, like,
flames all around.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.947
I keep showing him the design,
he keeps asking for changes, like:

08:19.166 --> 08:21.158
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

08:21.376 --> 08:24.330
And I'm like, "A:
This ain't the Sistine Chapel.

08:24.546 --> 08:28.758
And B: I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

08:29.092 --> 08:31.418
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.510
You need to avoid
those type of people.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.676
I know and I do.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.136
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.182
It's actually really corporate.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.269
Thank you.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.114
So how's your job?

08:53.325 --> 08:55.199
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.699
Doing backup training
on my days off.

08:57.913 --> 09:01.697
God, they're hiring anybody now.
I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.289
You seeing anyone?

09:11.510 --> 09:12.969
No.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.335
You?

09:15.097 --> 09:17.136
What about that guy next door?

09:17.349 --> 09:18.677
What do you mean?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.217
Well, he seemed to have
some expectation...

09:21.436 --> 09:23.014
...of you introducing me to him.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.306
He knows you own the place.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.149
Yeah.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.682
Dad, he's our tenant.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.725
End of story.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.855
Why would I get involved
with a tenant?

09:34.950 --> 09:35.981
Okay.

09:37.119 --> 09:38.743
There you go.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.083
Oh, yes.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.375
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

09:52.593 --> 09:55.084
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.676
Yeah. And why not?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.633
Good stock.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.103
I'll get it.

10:04.313 --> 10:05.593
Yeah. Yeah.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.601
Hello. Hello?

10:10.194 --> 10:11.985
Nobody's there.

10:12.196 --> 10:13.773
Oh, well.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.574
Beat you.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.118
- Hello.
- Hey, man.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.787
Oh, hi, Carmen.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.529
Just Carmen.

10:23.749 --> 10:27.367
- Come on. Hurry up.
- So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.958
Good news.
Oh, she's just so beautiful.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.548
Well, Holly.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.585
Seven pounds, 3 ounces.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.339
Everybody is doing just fine.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.306
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

10:40.516 --> 10:42.638
I am trying to tell you, man.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.769
Last night,
somebody broke in my place, yo.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.438
- I got robbed.
- What?

10:47.648 --> 10:52.144
Yeah. Somebody,
they got all of our stuff. Okay?

10:52.361 --> 10:54.069
All of it.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.273
You get me, Mr. White?

10:58.492 --> 11:00.568
The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.992
They knew exactly where to look.

11:03.539 --> 11:06.824
I mean, say something, man, all right?
Yell at me or something! Come on!

11:07.668 --> 11:09.328
Mr. White.

11:11.547 --> 11:12.957
God!

11:13.882 --> 11:15.626
Oh, no.

11:18.303 --> 11:21.838
Okay. Okay. Okay.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.149
Hank, come on.
People are starving to death out here.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.398
All right. I just had to get a beer.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.152
Finally.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.940
All right, guys. Here we go.

11:37.155 --> 11:40.939
We got mild, medium
and muy caliente.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.367
I got dibs on the breast.

11:43.579 --> 11:46.698
- Los Pollos Hermanos?
- Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

11:46.915 --> 11:50.201
I think this joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.454
That baby is hungry.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.046
Give me that baby.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.379
Oh, sweetie, yes.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.216
Do you have any coleslaw in there?

11:58.427 --> 12:00.051
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.

12:01.096 --> 12:04.547
- Not at the table. We're eating.
- Hank, it's only a breast.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.851
- It's my sister-in-law's breast.
- Oh, you are so provincial.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.472
Hank, remember the day...

12:10.689 --> 12:12.978
...when you were talking to me
about childproofing?

12:13.192 --> 12:14.223
Yeah.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.898
Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

12:17.112 --> 12:20.861
Yeah. No, well, actually, I was
thinking more of an alarm system.

12:21.074 --> 12:25.024
They've got these new systems that
are now sonar systems that would...

12:25.245 --> 12:27.452
Anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.660
Oh, nice.

12:28.874 --> 12:31.709
- Wow, that sounds expensive.
- Well, yeah.

12:31.919 --> 12:36.581
- But for the baby, I mean...
- Well, why don't...

12:37.633 --> 12:39.756
Why don't you let Marie and I
get that for you?

12:39.968 --> 12:42.376
- Absolutely.
- No, no. Thank you.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.087
No, no, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.967
We'll take care of it.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.058
Back at work soon?

12:49.937 --> 12:51.810
Since you're scheduled
for surgery...

12:52.022 --> 12:56.269
...I just thought it might be a good
idea to have some money coming in.

12:57.903 --> 13:02.980
Well, Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.280
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years...

13:08.413 --> 13:12.541
Money-wise, we'll manage.
I promise you that.

13:12.751 --> 13:16.369
What? You guys got, like, a printing
press in the garage churning out 50s?

13:16.588 --> 13:17.619
I wish.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.832
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

13:20.050 --> 13:23.633
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.087
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.398
I'll get her.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.650
I'll get her.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.490
Yes. Good girl.

13:50.706 --> 13:53.031
That's a good girl.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.492
My little girl, huh?

14:07.389 --> 14:10.924
Hey, do you wanna see something?

14:12.227 --> 14:13.805
Come here.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.810
Oh, I know, I know.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.862
Yeah.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.037
Hey.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.868
You wanna see what
your daddy did for you?

14:37.211 --> 14:38.871
Let me show you.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.919
Here. Come here.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.004
Wanna see?

14:59.066 --> 15:03.277
That's right. Daddy did that.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.610
Daddy did that for you.

15:22.673 --> 15:25.590
This place looks exactly the same.

15:25.801 --> 15:29.134
Why don't you have computers
and shit? It's the 20th century.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.840
What the hell are you doing here?

15:31.056 --> 15:33.049
- Get out.
- No. You took the stash.

15:33.267 --> 15:35.224
I heard all those messages,
figured it out.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.389
You figured it out, huh?
Well, congratulations, Einstein.

15:38.605 --> 15:42.354
You left me to freak out all day long
like I dropped the ball or something...

15:42.568 --> 15:46.102
- ...and you were the one who took it!
- Shut up.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.939
You lower your voice.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.785
"Like you dropped the ball"?

15:55.998 --> 15:59.746
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

15:59.960 --> 16:02.451
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

16:02.671 --> 16:05.874
What was that, heroin?

16:07.843 --> 16:08.922
Jesus.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.800
I was on my day off, man.
What I do on my day off...

16:12.014 --> 16:14.302
"Day off"?
We were on call, you junkie.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.592
On call for the biggest deal
of our lives.

16:16.810 --> 16:20.179
I just managed to pull it off by the
skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

16:20.397 --> 16:24.477
And you made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.190
Son of a bitch.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.398
How much?

16:33.702 --> 16:37.367
- How much what?
- How much did you get for the deal?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.957
One-point-two million.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.587
Six hundred thousand each.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.589
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.338
Saul's cut is 20 percent.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.219
All right.
So where's my money?

16:55.516 --> 16:56.926
What?

16:58.769 --> 17:01.011
You are joking, right?

17:02.773 --> 17:05.098
If I gave you that money...

17:05.317 --> 17:07.475
...you would be dead
inside of a week.

17:09.321 --> 17:12.275
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.

17:12.491 --> 17:15.860
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.987
And the... And the meth.

17:18.455 --> 17:21.539
You know, I could take it or leave it.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.323
I'm clean, Mr. White.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.122
For real.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.554
Prove it. Pee in that.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.604
- How gay are you, seriously?
- Pee in it.

17:43.814 --> 17:46.139
They're selling testing kits
at the drugstores.

17:46.358 --> 17:49.692
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.186
No, huh?

17:53.282 --> 17:55.903
Well, I guess, until then
you'll just have to depend...

17:56.118 --> 17:59.072
...on the kindness of strangers
to get high.

17:59.288 --> 18:02.075
That and your little junkie girlfriend.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.437
Not on her tummy, Walt.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.405
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

18:34.615 --> 18:37.236
I'll put her on her side.
Do you wanna hold her back?

18:37.451 --> 18:39.194
- Yeah.
- Right there.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.902
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit-up...

18:42.122 --> 18:46.867
...I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

18:47.836 --> 18:50.161
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.788
- It's hypoallergenic.
- Oh, yeah?

18:53.509 --> 18:55.300
Well, I think a towel will do.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.889
Skyler, what is it?

19:01.975 --> 19:06.139
Your son. He is just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

19:11.485 --> 19:15.565
- I told you it's not ready yet.
- Honey, just show it to them.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.541
My God, son. That's wonderful.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.172
Flynn.

19:39.388 --> 19:41.760
This is beautiful.

19:42.474 --> 19:45.345
SaveWalterWhite.com.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.766
Well, I, for one,
am telling everybody.

19:50.399 --> 19:54.266
Wait a minute. You're not asking
for money, are you, son?

19:54.486 --> 19:56.443
Yeah. That's the whole idea.

19:56.655 --> 19:59.775
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.779
- See?
- But we can't ask for money.

20:05.581 --> 20:06.909
Walt.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.078
Okay.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.331
I appreciate it. I really do.

20:14.923 --> 20:17.046
Show me what else you put on.

20:19.261 --> 20:23.175
This was all his idea.
He worked so hard on it.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.383
- Just let him help.
- Skyler.

20:25.601 --> 20:29.468
It's... You can't ask him
to take it down.

20:29.688 --> 20:33.602
- It'll crush him.
- Skyler, it's charity.

20:36.028 --> 20:40.903
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of dirty word?

20:50.709 --> 20:52.583
This is insane.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.917
I have so much cash on hand...

20:55.130 --> 20:58.001
...that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

20:58.217 --> 21:01.586
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.639
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

21:04.848 --> 21:06.342
I mean, it's...

21:07.142 --> 21:08.173
It's insane.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.433
Well, I guess that's why
gangsters had molls.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.220
What?

21:13.649 --> 21:14.929
Gun molls.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.107
Haven't you ever seen White Heat?

21:18.195 --> 21:19.772
Yeah, I've seen White Heat...

21:19.988 --> 21:22.906
- ...but I don't see how that pertains.
- Maybe you need a moll...

21:23.116 --> 21:25.786
...more than a wife
who you can't trust with your secrets.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.536
- Just...
- What good is money...

21:27.746 --> 21:30.284
...that doesn't spend?
The tree falls in the forest...

21:30.499 --> 21:34.034
You know, you get the point.
So communicating is out?

21:35.337 --> 21:36.617
Out.

21:36.839 --> 21:38.214
Let's see. What else is there?

21:38.423 --> 21:40.712
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money...

21:40.926 --> 21:42.669
...down by the rail road tracks."

21:42.886 --> 21:45.424
No? No? Works for me.

21:46.390 --> 21:47.421
Uncle Murray.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.720
Oh, yeah.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.435
Yeah,
"Oh, many is the happy memory...

21:52.646 --> 21:54.555
...of Uncle Murray
bouncing me on his knee.

21:54.773 --> 21:57.442
We lost track of
the old pervert years ago...

21:57.651 --> 22:00.854
- ...but he kicked it, left me millions."
- No, no.

22:01.071 --> 22:06.314
It cannot be blind luck or some
imaginary relative who saves us.

22:06.535 --> 22:09.073
No, I earned that money, me.

22:09.872 --> 22:11.781
And now my son created
his own website...

22:11.999 --> 22:15.996
...SaveWalterWhite.com,
soliciting anonymous donations.

22:16.211 --> 22:19.876
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

22:23.886 --> 22:27.171
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.675
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.

22:30.893 --> 22:34.012
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

22:34.229 --> 22:36.803
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

22:37.024 --> 22:40.190
Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.189
- Do I have to spell it out for you?
- I know. I know.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.694
You're thinking that I should be
funneling money...

22:45.908 --> 22:48.031
...into my son's website,
but absolutely not.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.865
I am not going to have
my family think that some...

22:51.079 --> 22:53.238
...mystery benefactor saved us.

22:53.457 --> 22:56.411
Not some mystery benefactor,
singular.

22:56.627 --> 22:58.952
That would raise too many questions.
However...

22:59.171 --> 23:01.210
Stay with me here.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.965
...zombies.

23:04.593 --> 23:07.962
I got a guy, who knows this guy,
who knows this Rain Man-type.

23:08.180 --> 23:11.549
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus, all right?

23:11.767 --> 23:14.684
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

23:14.895 --> 23:18.311
Wait. He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

23:18.524 --> 23:21.145
This guy can hijack
random desktops...

23:21.360 --> 23:25.025
...all around the world, turn them
into zombies that do his bidding.

23:25.239 --> 23:29.699
For instance, he can make it
so 20- or 30,000...

23:29.910 --> 23:33.243
...little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.495
Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop...

23:35.707 --> 23:38.957
...all paid in full, nice and neat,
untraceable...

23:39.169 --> 23:43.084
...from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White...

23:43.298 --> 23:45.421
...cancer saint.

23:45.634 --> 23:49.299
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

23:52.808 --> 23:57.766
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

23:58.814 --> 24:00.273
Not too much.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.938
I mean, like, who is he, right?

24:03.151 --> 24:05.856
I mean, first off, I taught him.

24:06.071 --> 24:09.107
Always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

24:19.918 --> 24:21.710
Now the cotton.

24:27.593 --> 24:28.624
Needle?

24:30.762 --> 24:33.966
- I don't understand why you need him.
- Exactly.

24:35.309 --> 24:38.808
My point exactly.

24:47.821 --> 24:51.320
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

24:56.079 --> 24:58.286
How much does he owe you, anyway?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.992
Four hundred and eighty.

25:02.252 --> 25:05.538
Oh, hell, I'd be mad too
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

25:05.756 --> 25:07.962
No, no.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.508
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

25:12.346 --> 25:13.508
What?

25:15.599 --> 25:17.010
What?

25:17.518 --> 25:19.261
Thousand.

25:21.396 --> 25:23.188
Not on your back,
in case you throw up.

25:23.398 --> 25:26.684
On your side. Sleep on your side.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.110
And she's all like:

25:38.330 --> 25:41.865
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

25:42.084 --> 25:44.753
I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

25:44.962 --> 25:47.797
I'm conversing
about life and death."

25:48.006 --> 25:50.711
I mean, this here,
what we've been doing...

25:50.926 --> 25:52.965
...hell, Becky knows.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.178
Dad?

26:00.394 --> 26:02.552
I overslept. I'm on my way.

26:16.952 --> 26:18.411
Dad?

26:20.247 --> 26:21.410
Dad, wait.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.079
Dad, it's not what it looks like.

26:24.877 --> 26:26.419
Dad.

26:28.172 --> 26:30.959
Dad, will just wait? Let me...
Just talk to you for one second.

26:31.175 --> 26:32.254
No, Dad.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.756
Dad, come on.

26:38.390 --> 26:39.765
Dad?

26:41.268 --> 26:44.269
Dad, no. No, stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

26:44.479 --> 26:46.805
- Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
- Son of a bitch.

26:47.024 --> 26:51.602
Dad, no. Stop it!
Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

26:51.820 --> 26:54.655
- Get away from me, man. Back off.
- Jesse.

26:54.865 --> 26:55.896
- Jesse, no!
- Back off!

26:56.116 --> 26:58.821
- Okay, everybody just calm down!
- What's with you, yo?

26:59.036 --> 27:02.321
- Because I'll seriously bust you up.
- You miserable little smackhead.

27:02.539 --> 27:04.615
- Get the hell out!
- Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

27:04.833 --> 27:06.292
All right? I got civil rights.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.246
Dad, no! Okay!

27:08.462 --> 27:10.953
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.962
I pay my rent.

27:15.719 --> 27:18.127
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

27:18.347 --> 27:20.719
Look, as it so happens,
we were just...

27:20.933 --> 27:22.557
We were just talking
about that now.

27:22.768 --> 27:24.974
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?

27:25.187 --> 27:27.642
- If you would just let me.
- Eighteen months.

27:27.856 --> 27:31.272
You have been clean for 18 months,
Jane. Why? Why do you do it?

27:32.861 --> 27:34.653
I backslid, okay?

27:35.322 --> 27:36.602
Like, what?

27:36.823 --> 27:38.816
What, you think I'm proud of this?

27:39.034 --> 27:40.861
Like I do it on purpose?

27:41.078 --> 27:42.489
Lying to me...

27:42.704 --> 27:45.658
...shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser.

27:45.874 --> 27:47.037
It takes one to know one.

27:47.251 --> 27:50.168
His name is Jesse. You don't know
the first thing about him.

27:50.379 --> 27:53.000
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

27:53.215 --> 27:56.085
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

27:56.885 --> 28:01.179
Thank you for not being judgmental
24 hours a day.

28:01.390 --> 28:05.257
Because that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

28:07.312 --> 28:08.344
Okay.

28:08.564 --> 28:10.889
You know what you need?
I'll tell you what you need.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.139
What are you doing?

28:12.359 --> 28:14.980
- What are you doing?
- I am calling the police.

28:15.696 --> 28:18.981
- Dad. Dad, no, don't.
- Come on. Come on!

28:19.199 --> 28:21.239
- Dad, no. Don't.
- I have tried 10 years...

28:21.451 --> 28:22.946
...of love and understanding.

28:23.161 --> 28:26.281
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

28:26.498 --> 28:27.873
Dad, no.

28:28.083 --> 28:31.452
Yes, I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

28:31.670 --> 28:34.920
- Dad. Daddy, no.
- No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.

28:35.132 --> 28:36.875
- I'd like to talk to somebody.
- Daddy.

28:37.092 --> 28:39.713
- Would you connect me, please?
- Fine, we'll go to rehab.

28:39.928 --> 28:41.968
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

28:42.181 --> 28:44.588
- I want you in rehab.
- I'll go first thing tomorrow.

28:44.808 --> 28:46.516
Not tomorrow. Today.

28:46.727 --> 28:49.977
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

28:50.189 --> 28:54.138
The last time I went, my houseplants
died because you didn't water them.

28:56.612 --> 28:59.731
Daddy, please?

29:00.032 --> 29:01.146
I'll go.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.904
Albuquerque Police.
How may I direct your call?

29:04.828 --> 29:06.406
Tomorrow.

29:06.955 --> 29:08.284
Hello?

29:10.626 --> 29:12.120
Hello?

29:12.628 --> 29:14.086
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

29:19.635 --> 29:20.749
Tomorrow.

29:39.446 --> 29:41.106
You meant all that?

29:42.908 --> 29:44.486
I don't know.

29:45.494 --> 29:48.115
I just think
if we had enough money...

29:48.914 --> 29:51.619
...nobody could make us
do anything.

30:20.988 --> 30:22.482
Oh, just let it ring.

30:22.698 --> 30:25.153
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

30:27.286 --> 30:29.077
It's okay, Holly.

30:29.454 --> 30:31.494
It's okay, sweetie.

30:32.207 --> 30:33.405
Good luck with that.

30:33.625 --> 30:37.160
But I'm sure he'd be glad to,
you know, write some...

30:37.379 --> 30:42.088
You know, actually, here he is
right now. So hold on a second.

30:42.759 --> 30:44.419
- What?
- It's one of your...

30:44.636 --> 30:48.634
One of your old students
wants a letter of recommendation.

30:49.099 --> 30:52.183
Oh, okay. Thanks.

30:52.394 --> 30:55.514
Oh, honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

30:56.690 --> 30:59.940
- This is Walter White.
- Hello, Walter White.

31:04.114 --> 31:06.522
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling...

31:06.742 --> 31:08.236
It's Jane.

31:08.452 --> 31:10.361
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

31:10.579 --> 31:11.824
Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."

31:12.039 --> 31:17.080
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
It really has been a long time.

31:17.294 --> 31:18.836
Get somewhere where you can talk.

31:19.046 --> 31:23.708
Sure. Yes.
I am looking into that as we speak.

31:26.470 --> 31:29.720
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

31:29.932 --> 31:32.683
All Jesse wants
is what's coming to him.

31:32.893 --> 31:34.387
No more, no less.

31:34.603 --> 31:36.062
What are you talking about?

31:36.271 --> 31:37.896
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

31:41.944 --> 31:45.692
- He told you about the money.
- He told me everything.

31:49.910 --> 31:52.911
So, what is this?

31:54.623 --> 31:56.746
What, some kind of blackmail
or something?

31:56.959 --> 31:58.916
This is me telling you
to do right by Jesse.

31:59.127 --> 32:00.586
Bring him what you owe him.

32:00.796 --> 32:02.207
I don't call that blackmail.

32:02.422 --> 32:05.589
I call that you getting off your ass,
and being a decent human being.

32:05.801 --> 32:07.343
Well, I call it blackmail.

32:07.553 --> 32:11.301
Dialing my number.
Talking to my wife.

32:12.182 --> 32:13.558
And what's your end of this?

32:13.767 --> 32:17.101
How much heroin
does a half a million dollars buy?

32:18.605 --> 32:21.275
For your information,
I am holding Jesse's money for him...

32:21.483 --> 32:23.606
...and he will receive
every last dollar of it.

32:23.819 --> 32:25.278
He will, not you...

32:25.487 --> 32:27.112
...at a time when I see fit.

32:27.322 --> 32:29.778
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

32:30.367 --> 32:32.692
Now you tell him, if he gets clean...

32:32.911 --> 32:34.904
- if you both get clean...
- You know what?

32:35.122 --> 32:36.782
I take that back. This is blackmail.

32:36.999 --> 32:39.371
Because what I know about you,
high-school teacher...

32:39.585 --> 32:42.206
...turned drug dealer,
with a brother-in-law in the DEA...

32:42.421 --> 32:45.624
...that would make one hell of a story.
National news, I'll bet.

32:46.550 --> 32:51.591
Do right by Jesse tonight
or I will burn you to the ground.

32:59.646 --> 33:00.678
Shit.

33:04.318 --> 33:07.319
He's a high-school teacher. What's
he gonna do, give you a B-minus?

33:07.529 --> 33:10.151
Send you outside
to clap the erasers?

33:11.700 --> 33:16.113
You wouldn't really go to the cops,
would you?

33:16.538 --> 33:18.495
We won't have to. He'll pay.

33:19.833 --> 33:21.078
And what if he doesn't?

33:21.293 --> 33:23.167
Jesse, it's your money.

33:23.378 --> 33:27.839
You're in the right here. He's in
the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.

33:32.387 --> 33:34.179
What is it, really?

33:34.389 --> 33:36.762
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

33:36.975 --> 33:40.510
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

33:42.564 --> 33:46.229
No, it's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

33:46.443 --> 33:49.693
And by extension, you know,
neither are you.

33:55.369 --> 33:57.694
I mean, he's my partner.

34:00.916 --> 34:02.659
I'm your partner.

34:11.051 --> 34:13.044
The largest land animal
in all the planet...

34:13.262 --> 34:15.931
...lives in a tightly knit
matriarchal society...

34:16.139 --> 34:18.216
...led by the eldest female
in the herd.

34:20.185 --> 34:23.222
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

35:15.616 --> 35:19.530
She is finally asleep.

35:23.457 --> 35:27.122
What you doing,
learning about elephants?

35:37.846 --> 35:42.140
Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

36:19.555 --> 36:20.965
Jesse.

36:21.598 --> 36:23.176
Not you.

36:37.239 --> 36:39.148
Nice job wearing the pants.

36:46.331 --> 36:48.538
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

36:49.084 --> 36:51.124
I guess you don't.

36:53.922 --> 36:56.674
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

36:59.845 --> 37:02.680
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

37:03.265 --> 37:04.843
You are making a mistake.

37:20.824 --> 37:23.576
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a whole lot of cheddar.

37:23.785 --> 37:25.363
This is freedom.

37:25.579 --> 37:28.414
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

37:28.624 --> 37:30.912
I can be anybody."

37:31.210 --> 37:32.585
Who do you wanna be?

37:32.794 --> 37:35.914
Where do you wanna go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

37:36.131 --> 37:39.417
- Is New Zealand part of Australia?
- New Zealand is New Zealand.

37:39.635 --> 37:40.714
Right on.

37:40.928 --> 37:44.094
New Zealand. That's where
they made Lord of the Rings.

37:44.306 --> 37:47.177
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

37:47.392 --> 37:50.144
Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

37:50.354 --> 37:52.430
And I can be a bush pilot.

37:52.648 --> 37:55.221
Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

37:55.442 --> 37:59.522
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

38:06.787 --> 38:08.447
But first, we gotta get clean.

38:08.664 --> 38:10.621
And not because
anybody is telling us to.

38:10.832 --> 38:15.744
- We do this for us, right?
- Yeah. Absolutely. For us.

38:15.963 --> 38:18.917
All this here, we're not gonna
just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.

38:19.132 --> 38:20.164
We're not.

38:20.384 --> 38:22.875
Hell, no. No, no, no.
We're better than that.

38:23.095 --> 38:25.716
We're way better than that. I say...

38:25.931 --> 38:29.763
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

38:33.272 --> 38:35.181
Yeah, we can do that.

38:35.774 --> 38:37.482
Definitely.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.488
Excuse me.

38:52.124 --> 38:53.832
What can I get you?

38:55.002 --> 38:58.038
Give me a Fat Tire draft, please.

39:04.219 --> 39:05.797
Damn it.

39:08.599 --> 39:10.342
Hey, honey.

39:10.893 --> 39:13.218
No. I don't know what to tell you.

39:13.437 --> 39:17.731
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

39:18.275 --> 39:21.644
Well, do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

39:21.862 --> 39:24.732
What if we went up a size
and just kind of...

39:25.574 --> 39:27.567
All right, all right. No, I understand.

39:27.784 --> 39:30.785
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.

39:30.996 --> 39:34.661
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so...

39:35.083 --> 39:37.621
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

39:37.836 --> 39:39.461
Thank you.

39:40.047 --> 39:41.707
God.

39:43.091 --> 39:44.918
Well played.

39:54.728 --> 39:56.804
They found water on Mars.

39:58.148 --> 39:59.227
They have indeed.

39:59.816 --> 40:01.893
Don't know what to do
with that information...

40:02.110 --> 40:04.566
...but, hey, God bless them,
they found it.

40:06.657 --> 40:09.029
Oh, well, actually...

40:09.243 --> 40:13.951
...they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen...

40:14.164 --> 40:18.376
...and process that into providing
fuel for manned space flights.

40:18.585 --> 40:22.915
Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

40:23.131 --> 40:24.923
So it's a...

40:25.843 --> 40:29.757
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.

40:30.305 --> 40:34.884
- To water on Mars.
- To water on Mars.

40:37.938 --> 40:41.058
So, what did you have? Girl or boy?

40:42.484 --> 40:44.607
- Little girl.
- That's nice.

40:44.820 --> 40:46.018
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

40:46.238 --> 40:47.269
Thank you.

40:47.489 --> 40:49.945
- I have a daughter.
- Yeah?

40:50.200 --> 40:51.778
How old?

40:51.994 --> 40:53.452
Old enough to know better.

40:54.204 --> 40:56.280
Twenty-seven next month.

40:58.792 --> 41:02.078
- You have other kids?
- Just the one.

41:03.547 --> 41:07.758
I've got a 16-year-old boy.
Well, he's almost 16.

41:08.343 --> 41:12.092
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

41:12.848 --> 41:14.675
But he helps out, though.

41:14.892 --> 41:17.762
He's even changing some diapers
now, so...

41:17.978 --> 41:21.181
It's more than I managed to do
when I was his age.

41:22.191 --> 41:24.978
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

41:25.527 --> 41:28.445
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

41:30.199 --> 41:32.025
So, any advice?

41:32.784 --> 41:35.869
Having a daughter. Any advice?

41:36.705 --> 41:39.659
No, not really. Just love them.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.499
Just... Yeah.

41:41.710 --> 41:45.245
I mean, they are who they are.

41:47.007 --> 41:48.501
Yeah.

41:49.593 --> 41:53.804
I've got this nephew.

41:56.683 --> 42:00.099
This nephew who is...
I mean, he's an adult.

42:01.355 --> 42:06.645
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

42:07.194 --> 42:10.729
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

42:10.948 --> 42:12.442
You know, that...

42:12.658 --> 42:16.027
God, that frustration
that goes along with, you know:

42:16.245 --> 42:20.289
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

42:22.501 --> 42:24.577
But of course, they don't.

42:26.797 --> 42:29.370
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

42:30.050 --> 42:31.461
Family?

42:34.429 --> 42:37.845
Yeah. Family.

42:38.559 --> 42:41.050
You can't give up on them. Never.

42:41.270 --> 42:44.306
I mean, what else is there?

43:30.444 --> 43:33.149
Jesse, it's me.

43:38.994 --> 43:42.410
Jesse, I just wanna talk.

44:19.993 --> 44:21.867
Jesus.

44:38.220 --> 44:39.762
Jesse.

44:44.893 --> 44:46.352
Jesse.

44:48.397 --> 44:50.639
Jesse, wake up.

44:50.858 --> 44:53.479
Jesse, wake up.

45:22.431 --> 45:24.222
No, no, no.
