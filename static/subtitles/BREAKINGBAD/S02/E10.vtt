02:27.022 --> 02:30.936
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

02:31.568 --> 02:34.771
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.029
- What?
- Just take the rest of the week.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.946
Please. You've earned it.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.869
Don't push it.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.200
Besides, I want you well
for the weekend.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.951
Mom wants to party.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.836
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.376
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.465
Just family and a few friends.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.927
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

03:06.979 --> 03:08.473
Sounds good.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.861
Oh, thank you.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.702
Now...

03:24.538 --> 03:26.780
...what are you supposed
to do today?

03:26.999 --> 03:30.332
- Nothing.
- Excellent.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.795
Brownie points for taking a nap.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.430
Can you meet?

05:15.482 --> 05:19.729
I thought maybe you
might have, you know...

05:19.945 --> 05:21.404
...kicked.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.939
Signed... Signed off.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.731
I was even checking the obits.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.952
No such luck.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.998
So where does it stand?

05:33.667 --> 05:37.451
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

05:37.671 --> 05:40.542
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

05:40.757 --> 05:42.465
What's the upshot?

05:43.468 --> 05:44.797
The upshot.

05:47.598 --> 05:52.141
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.309
Damn.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.897
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

06:02.237 --> 06:06.484
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.325
In fact...

06:09.703 --> 06:12.490
...the news is all good.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.248
What do you mean, good?

06:16.210 --> 06:18.879
You mean, like, "good" good?

06:20.464 --> 06:22.172
What, you mean, like,
remission good?

06:23.759 --> 06:28.919
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.345
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumors.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.100
How significant?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.472
Eighty percent.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.849
Dude. No way.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.151
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch...

06:44.696 --> 06:48.361
...but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.529
That's awesome. Serious?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.450
That's... That's great, man.

06:54.665 --> 06:58.199
I mean, my aunt, she never...
I mean, you know, at your stage...

06:58.418 --> 07:00.625
...I didn't think that could happen.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.296
Yeah.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.998
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

07:05.217 --> 07:08.004
No. You must be so psyched.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.053
Of course. I am.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.638
Okay, now we...

07:16.603 --> 07:19.059
I mean, what do we...?

07:19.273 --> 07:22.227
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.564
So how do you want to...

07:31.243 --> 07:33.816
...you know, proceed...

07:34.037 --> 07:36.707
...in light of this kick-ass news?

07:39.626 --> 07:44.087
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.290
Sell off what we have.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.133
And then...

07:51.597 --> 07:54.930
Well, then I guess...

07:56.310 --> 07:57.768
...I'm done.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.954
- Batter up.
- Everyone?

08:21.752 --> 08:24.421
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast...

08:25.047 --> 08:29.590
- ...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
- Somebody kill the music.

08:30.469 --> 08:33.636
I know one party
can't begin to repay...

08:33.847 --> 08:39.054
...all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.558
But then again...

08:41.772 --> 08:46.315
...Hank does make
one mean margarita.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.690
We really do want to thank you.

08:51.907 --> 08:55.323
These last few months have been...

08:55.994 --> 09:00.656
...wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.330
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.663
- All right.
- Honey, I'm so proud of you.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.546
We all are.

09:11.552 --> 09:15.170
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.346
But it's true. It really is.

09:17.558 --> 09:21.009
And for the first time
in a long time...

09:21.228 --> 09:24.182
...we are so excited about the future.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.812
Okay, anyway...

09:29.027 --> 09:31.697
...I want to also
express my gratitude...

09:31.905 --> 09:36.863
...to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.031
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.990
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...

09:42.207 --> 09:45.208
...for those of you
who don't know them, are...

09:45.878 --> 09:49.163
Well, they're heroes.

09:49.381 --> 09:53.295
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer...

09:53.510 --> 09:56.297
...to pay for Walt's treatment.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.056
And they did.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.851
So...

10:02.644 --> 10:04.055
...to Gretchen and Elliott.

10:04.563 --> 10:07.979
- To Gretchen and Elliot.
- Cheers.

10:08.192 --> 10:11.062
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.653
- Speech.
- Yes.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.357
- Speech.
- Yeah, Dad.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.945
Come on, Walt. Speech.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.910
Well, it's...

10:21.121 --> 10:22.663
It's kind of funny.

10:23.207 --> 10:28.331
When I got my diagnosis, cancer...

10:29.087 --> 10:32.706
...I said to myself, you know:

10:32.966 --> 10:34.164
"Why me?"

10:36.386 --> 10:37.929
And then...

10:39.306 --> 10:42.426
...the other day,
when I got the good news...

10:45.646 --> 10:47.971
...I said the same thing.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.778
Anyway.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.992
Thank you for coming.

11:02.538 --> 11:05.788
And enjoy.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.627
- All right, cheers.
- Yeah.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.165
Cheers.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.588
Inspirational.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.044
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.292
I'll tell you that much.

11:18.512 --> 11:22.095
A little mercury switch,
9-volt battery...

11:22.307 --> 11:26.435
...five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.433
Yeah, but why a turtle?

11:29.648 --> 11:32.317
Oh, that's the best part. It was a...

11:32.526 --> 11:34.933
It was a... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

11:35.445 --> 11:38.814
Not a metaphor, not an analogy,
it's a...

11:39.032 --> 11:41.523
Walt, what's the word
I'm looking for?

11:43.370 --> 11:44.864
Anyway...

11:45.080 --> 11:48.829
...Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.331
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

11:51.545 --> 11:56.254
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.839
Hey, top me off there,
will you, buddy?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.712
Anyway.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.757
Poetic.

12:02.973 --> 12:06.971
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.095
I guess that's the word.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.162
Go ahead.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.707
Better not let your mom see.

12:51.104 --> 12:56.063
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
Maybe two.

12:57.528 --> 13:00.398
- There's no worm in this, right?
- No, that would be mescal.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.903
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

13:03.116 --> 13:06.201
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.780
Had this firearm instructor
who was...

13:09.998 --> 13:12.668
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

13:12.876 --> 13:16.245
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

13:16.463 --> 13:19.085
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.256
We were drinking mescal stupid.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.591
But... Hey, hey.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.761
Walt, what you doing there?

13:29.184 --> 13:30.678
What does it look like I'm doing?

13:32.229 --> 13:33.937
The kid's 16.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.557
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.358
What are you looking at him for?

13:47.661 --> 13:49.404
We're celebrating. Come on.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.203
That's all right.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.293
No.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.145
Jesus.

14:20.986 --> 14:24.853
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

14:25.073 --> 14:28.240
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.822
Hey.

14:32.873 --> 14:36.573
Bring the bottle back.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.630
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.675
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.556
- It's all right.
- What are you waiting for?

14:52.768 --> 14:53.966
Bring it back.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.686
Why don't we just call it a day?

15:04.988 --> 15:06.530
All right, pal?

15:08.992 --> 15:12.242
- We good?
- The bottle.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.362
Now.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.672
What's going on?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.508
Jesus.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.974
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.848
Oh, my God.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.060
Okay. Okay.

15:47.281 --> 15:50.614
There you go. Okay. That's it.

15:50.826 --> 15:53.115
Just get it out. That's okay.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.537
This is your brain.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.256
This is your brain on drugs.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.143
You weren't supposed to wake up.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.568
Ever or...?

16:29.489 --> 16:34.401
No, I was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.118
You want me to go back to bed?

16:37.873 --> 16:39.912
No, I guess that'd be kind of...

16:41.835 --> 16:43.460
No.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.590
Need some help?

16:47.799 --> 16:49.709
No, I got it.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.013
Just have a seat.

16:54.306 --> 16:56.049
Is there any coffee?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.473
Yeah, shit. One second.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.644
Well, at least let me do that.

17:01.855 --> 17:05.022
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

17:13.158 --> 17:16.610
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

17:16.995 --> 17:19.830
It's huevos rancheros.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.953
- I can tell.
- Yeah?

17:25.629 --> 17:28.001
- Fork.
- Oh, yeah.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.225
There you go.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.976
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

17:44.189 --> 17:47.689
- Whatever that means.
- No.

17:50.571 --> 17:52.362
I'm all yours.

17:52.739 --> 17:53.771
Really?

18:35.324 --> 18:39.321
Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.

18:41.538 --> 18:42.867
Hi.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.326
I just wanted to say that...

18:47.544 --> 18:48.742
No.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.792
We'll talk tonight...

18:54.301 --> 18:56.792
...but I wanted to say that...

18:58.639 --> 19:01.805
...I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday...

19:02.017 --> 19:03.926
...but it wasn't me.

19:06.772 --> 19:08.314
And I'm sorry.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.312
Love you.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.308
Oh, boy.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.244
I just wanted to say that...

20:07.457 --> 20:08.656
No.

20:09.251 --> 20:13.580
We'll talk tonight,
but I wanted to say that...

20:13.797 --> 20:15.172
Hey there.

20:15.382 --> 20:19.296
- Wow, who brought the churros?
- That would be me.

20:19.511 --> 20:22.963
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so...

20:24.892 --> 20:29.185
They're actually... They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.305
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

20:32.774 --> 20:34.399
Actually...

20:34.610 --> 20:36.234
...Walt's got...

20:38.572 --> 20:42.356
He's been battling cancer.

20:43.118 --> 20:46.072
- Skyler...
- And last week we got good news.

20:46.288 --> 20:50.416
- I'm so sorry.
- But we're really optimistic.

20:50.626 --> 20:51.954
Great.

20:52.461 --> 20:54.786
- Great. Good news is great.
- Yeah.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.461
Yeah, it is. It really is.

21:01.637 --> 21:03.131
Well...

21:03.597 --> 21:06.218
...feel free to bring these any time.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.975
Yeah.

21:19.029 --> 21:21.401
Got some real beauts.

21:24.284 --> 21:28.199
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.956
Yeah?

21:30.999 --> 21:34.084
Then again, what about tankless?

21:35.629 --> 21:37.420
Sure. We got them.

21:37.631 --> 21:40.252
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.551
Set you back about 1200.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.968
It's not an issue.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.049
You want installation, right?

21:51.270 --> 21:55.896
- No. I'm gonna do it myself.
- That's what I like to hear.

22:07.619 --> 22:10.656
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

22:11.582 --> 22:13.907
That's Hover Man.

22:14.126 --> 22:16.996
He can surf, skate, glide...

22:17.212 --> 22:21.755
...whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

22:21.967 --> 22:24.458
That's cool. Great lines.

22:29.099 --> 22:31.258
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

22:31.977 --> 22:34.468
That's Kanga-man.

22:34.688 --> 22:37.261
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

22:37.900 --> 22:41.767
- And who's this in his pouch?
- His sidekick, Joey.

22:42.487 --> 22:45.572
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know...

22:46.033 --> 22:47.361
...fights crime.

22:47.576 --> 22:50.530
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.156
You know that, right?

22:53.498 --> 22:55.954
Only female kangaroos
have pouches.

22:56.168 --> 22:57.627
Yeah, yeah, I know.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.292
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

23:00.506 --> 23:02.794
He's a product of experimentation.

23:03.592 --> 23:05.964
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

23:09.181 --> 23:12.550
- And this is?
- It's Backwardo.

23:13.519 --> 23:16.473
Wait, no. I actually...
I changed it to Rewindo.

23:16.688 --> 23:18.764
Anyways, he goes backwards.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.642
He can make everything
go in reverse.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.899
Time and stuff? Like time traveling?

23:23.111 --> 23:25.649
No, he just walks backwards.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.648
He walks backwards?

23:29.034 --> 23:32.035
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

23:32.246 --> 23:34.618
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.749
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

23:37.960 --> 23:41.245
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.123
Okay.

23:43.340 --> 23:45.831
Yo, I was a kid...

23:46.051 --> 23:47.593
...when I drew all these.

23:48.095 --> 23:50.337
It was like four years ago.

23:51.223 --> 23:54.307
- They all look like you.
- What?

23:55.060 --> 23:57.349
It's you in all of these.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.682
No.

23:59.898 --> 24:02.899
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

24:03.110 --> 24:05.268
Oh, shut up.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.527
Like you never wanted
a superpower.

24:15.706 --> 24:19.288
- Is that your door or mine?
- I don't know.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.501
It sounds like mine.

24:30.596 --> 24:32.719
- I gotta go.
- Where?

24:34.266 --> 24:36.887
Hey, where?

24:40.022 --> 24:42.061
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

24:51.575 --> 24:53.034
Jane.

25:05.047 --> 25:06.457
Jane.

25:19.937 --> 25:22.225
- Hey, Dad.
- There you are.

25:23.273 --> 25:24.684
Hi, honey.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.854
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

25:28.195 --> 25:31.196
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.613
Finally realized that
I wasn't the drum track?

25:34.993 --> 25:37.365
- Exactly.
- Well, I was in the neighbourhood.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.331
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

25:40.541 --> 25:41.786
Sure. Yeah.

25:42.543 --> 25:46.706
Hey, this your dad?

25:48.090 --> 25:49.667
- Yes.
- Hello.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.128
Hi.

25:51.343 --> 25:53.051
This is the new tenant.

25:53.262 --> 25:55.883
- Donald.
- Jesse.

25:59.101 --> 26:01.556
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

26:05.566 --> 26:07.309
- No.
- Dad, why don't you come in?

26:07.526 --> 26:09.103
It was nice seeing you.

26:09.319 --> 26:12.273
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

26:42.895 --> 26:44.353
Hey, Dad.

26:45.647 --> 26:49.515
- Hey, son. Are you home early?
- No.

26:50.736 --> 26:52.360
Oh, man.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.981
It was a good day?

26:56.617 --> 27:00.199
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.405
Yes. Yes, indeed.

27:02.623 --> 27:06.122
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

27:06.335 --> 27:07.710
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

27:07.920 --> 27:12.000
- Hey, want to take her for a spin?
- Oh, yeah.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.881
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

27:15.093 --> 27:18.297
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

27:18.514 --> 27:20.091
Okay.

27:21.141 --> 27:24.059
Pilot in.

27:24.269 --> 27:26.939
Ignition. Bingo.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.725
Okay.

27:29.358 --> 27:32.312
- Ready.
- All right. Let her rip.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.403
Hundred and seventeen
thousand BTUs.

27:42.621 --> 27:44.614
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.239
Built-in corrosion-resistant
draft reducer...

27:47.459 --> 27:49.915
...safety thermocouple
with the pilot burner.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.204
Sounds really good, Dad.

27:52.798 --> 27:54.589
And the energy savings. I mean...

27:54.800 --> 27:56.923
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

27:57.135 --> 27:59.923
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

28:00.138 --> 28:02.760
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.478
Son...

28:08.355 --> 28:12.104
- ...about yesterday...
- I'm sorry about the pool.

28:13.652 --> 28:17.602
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.533
See, your...

28:21.118 --> 28:23.324
Your old man embarrassed himself...

28:23.537 --> 28:25.779
...and I'm not very proud
of my behaviour.

28:25.998 --> 28:29.782
I have to say I feel very foolish.

28:32.504 --> 28:36.502
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

28:36.717 --> 28:40.050
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

28:40.262 --> 28:44.129
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

28:47.019 --> 28:50.637
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

28:51.565 --> 28:54.519
I should have used
better judgment all around.

28:55.527 --> 28:58.730
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right...

28:58.947 --> 29:01.106
...and for that I'm very sorry.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.575
But I kept up, right?

29:05.662 --> 29:09.660
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.255
I have some tools to put away.

30:21.446 --> 30:22.822
Hey.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.196
Yo.

30:26.410 --> 30:28.568
You want to catch a movie later?

30:31.957 --> 30:33.451
Yo.

30:34.751 --> 30:38.037
- What?
- What was that all about?

30:39.006 --> 30:40.334
What?

30:40.632 --> 30:42.958
Before. With your dad.

30:44.219 --> 30:45.713
It wasn't about anything.

30:45.929 --> 30:50.971
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

30:51.185 --> 30:53.426
If anything, I was doing you a favour.

30:53.645 --> 30:55.223
A favour?

30:55.898 --> 30:58.139
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

30:58.358 --> 31:01.063
- He seemed cool to me.
- Yeah, well.

31:01.278 --> 31:04.611
- So, what's the deal?
- There's no deal.

31:04.823 --> 31:08.157
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

31:09.328 --> 31:10.905
- How's that?
- I mean...

31:12.414 --> 31:15.201
...I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

31:16.335 --> 31:17.449
I bought a filter.

31:17.669 --> 31:20.041
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

31:20.839 --> 31:23.295
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

31:23.509 --> 31:24.967
So?

31:26.678 --> 31:28.636
- So?
- You think I'm gonna be all like:

31:28.847 --> 31:30.887
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.555
And by the way,
I'm sleeping with him"?

31:34.728 --> 31:36.306
That's all you think you're doing?

31:36.897 --> 31:39.139
- Why do you even care about my dad?
- I don't.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.646
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

31:41.860 --> 31:45.478
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

31:45.697 --> 31:48.105
- Us.
- Yeah.

31:49.326 --> 31:50.322
You and me.

31:52.162 --> 31:54.321
Who's you and me?

32:02.256 --> 32:03.833
I'm out of here.

33:45.734 --> 33:47.193
Oh, boy.

33:57.329 --> 33:58.907
Dad?

34:04.294 --> 34:06.702
Dad? Hello?

34:07.339 --> 34:09.130
What? Oh, hey.

34:10.676 --> 34:13.249
- What are you doing?
- We've got rot.

34:13.470 --> 34:16.092
- Rot?
- Yeah. Here.

34:16.306 --> 34:18.714
I'll show you. Here.

34:18.934 --> 34:19.965
Take a look at that.

34:22.437 --> 34:25.438
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like it?

34:27.025 --> 34:29.398
- It's wood.
- It's wood...

34:29.611 --> 34:31.319
...that contains fruiting bodies.

34:32.197 --> 34:33.228
Fruity what?

34:33.740 --> 34:36.694
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

34:36.910 --> 34:38.950
I don't really see anything.

34:39.162 --> 34:42.614
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.451
Then you cut it all out.

34:46.086 --> 34:48.079
You just cut it out and start fresh.

34:49.214 --> 34:51.884
Well, better get to it.

34:52.259 --> 34:55.176
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

34:55.888 --> 34:57.845
Not if I can help it.

35:25.584 --> 35:27.873
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

35:28.420 --> 35:31.955
- Go home already.
- I will. I will.

35:34.218 --> 35:36.709
Hey, can I just ask...

35:37.721 --> 35:40.426
- ...the Keller account?
- The Keller account?

35:40.641 --> 35:44.306
It's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet...

35:44.520 --> 35:48.564
...but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so...

35:48.774 --> 35:49.805
Oh, God.

35:50.025 --> 35:53.228
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

35:53.445 --> 35:56.731
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships...

35:56.949 --> 35:58.941
...with these little companies.

35:59.409 --> 36:02.743
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.241
Right.

36:05.999 --> 36:08.953
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

36:09.628 --> 36:11.122
Sky?

36:13.298 --> 36:14.378
Skyler?

36:15.551 --> 36:17.259
Jesus.

36:19.513 --> 36:21.719
No, I'm fine.

36:22.891 --> 36:27.019
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

36:28.230 --> 36:30.057
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:37.239 --> 36:38.614
What's wrong?

36:42.244 --> 36:44.071
I guess it just...

36:46.832 --> 36:50.283
...doesn't feel any different.

36:54.590 --> 36:57.793
The good news?

36:59.052 --> 37:03.133
I mean, nothing's really changed.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.973
It's just postponed.

37:08.896 --> 37:11.980
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

37:16.361 --> 37:18.650
But lately, it just feels like...

37:20.616 --> 37:22.240
More tunnel.

37:22.743 --> 37:24.486
I'm sorry.

37:30.542 --> 37:33.247
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

37:34.046 --> 37:36.038
I don't know.

37:36.882 --> 37:38.625
For me, it was the flu.

37:39.218 --> 37:42.503
- What?
- My dad rallied at the end.

37:42.721 --> 37:45.093
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got...

37:45.307 --> 37:47.845
...different circumstances,
but we were happy...

37:48.060 --> 37:49.684
...we were over the moon.

37:49.895 --> 37:53.145
And right then, I got sick.

37:53.732 --> 37:56.353
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

37:56.568 --> 37:59.439
Couldn't get out of bed,
I couldn't move.

37:59.905 --> 38:02.526
- Great timing, huh?
- Yeah.

38:03.909 --> 38:07.574
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

38:07.788 --> 38:09.365
"Why now?"

38:12.459 --> 38:14.416
Being that rock.

38:15.587 --> 38:17.046
You know...

38:17.589 --> 38:21.967
...being that rock
takes everything you got.

38:28.350 --> 38:29.809
Yeah.

39:26.074 --> 39:28.067
...causing the housing prices
to trend.

39:28.285 --> 39:31.784
Foreclosures are being fueled
by a spike in...

39:34.791 --> 39:39.003
The economy is rapidly deteriorating
and unemployment is climbing.

39:39.213 --> 39:42.961
With Americans losing money over
rising inflation and tight spending...

39:43.175 --> 39:45.630
...the housing market
is unlikely to rebound...

39:45.844 --> 39:48.514
...spelling more pain
for the economy.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.309
Yeah.

40:17.459 --> 40:20.080
Are you going to work today?

40:22.506 --> 40:24.629
Skyler, there's rot.

40:33.684 --> 40:35.178
I'm going back.

42:07.653 --> 42:11.485
All right. We'll take care of that
tomorrow. Okay, good night.

42:17.704 --> 42:19.946
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night.

42:22.376 --> 42:24.368
Oh, damn.

42:26.672 --> 42:28.332
- Clumsy.
- I got it.

42:28.549 --> 42:30.790
No, no, Ted.
You don't have to do that.

42:59.830 --> 43:03.413
Get organized. Storage containers
to meet every need...

43:03.625 --> 43:06.199
...big or small, on Aisle 3.

43:06.420 --> 43:10.085
Stashing your stuff
has never been so easy.

43:22.060 --> 43:25.311
Get a thicker, fuller lawn
in less than six weeks.

43:25.522 --> 43:28.689
Why can't the grass
always be greener on your side?

43:28.901 --> 43:31.522
Go to Aisle 10 to go green.

43:37.159 --> 43:38.867
Get a manager
on Checkout 4, please.

43:39.077 --> 43:41.200
Manager to Checkout 4.

43:50.839 --> 43:52.796
Pest problems? No problem.

43:53.008 --> 43:56.792
Your extermination destination
is Aisle 6.

43:57.012 --> 43:59.218
You're buying the wrong matches.

43:59.890 --> 44:01.883
- What?
- Those matches.

44:02.100 --> 44:03.345
They're the wrong kind.

44:04.311 --> 44:06.719
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips...

44:06.939 --> 44:08.812
...not the matches themselves.

44:09.024 --> 44:12.725
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

44:17.199 --> 44:18.907
More striker strips. You understand?

44:19.743 --> 44:21.866
Those only have the one.

44:22.079 --> 44:24.570
And don't buy everything
in one place.

44:24.790 --> 44:26.035
Do it piecemeal.

44:26.250 --> 44:29.701
