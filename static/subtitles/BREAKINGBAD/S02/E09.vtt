"Breaking Bad Season 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 + Extras BDRip DVDRip HDTV TSV"

00:27.611 --> 00:29.485
These people.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.068
Pathetic.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.239
I already read that one anyway.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.409
Kleinman has better magazines.

00:37.621 --> 00:40.824
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.449
We won't even get the results
till next week.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.242
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

00:46.463 --> 00:49.168
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

00:49.383 --> 00:53.463
You definitely want the PET/CT
and not just the PET.

00:53.679 --> 00:57.130
Yeah, it's a PET/CT.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.805
Good. That's what you want.

01:00.018 --> 01:03.352
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

01:04.106 --> 01:06.395
I'm not naming any names.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.652
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.523
This is where Walt's doctor is.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.409
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week...

01:15.617 --> 01:17.361
...to get the results.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.532
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.325
I could take one look at Walt's...

01:22.749 --> 01:24.872
...and tell you immediately
how he's doing.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.872
- Really.
- Doctors like people to think...

01:28.088 --> 01:31.539
...that they're so much smarter
than the technicians...

01:31.758 --> 01:35.887
...but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

01:39.349 --> 01:43.394
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

01:44.021 --> 01:45.645
Excuse me.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.783
You all right in there?

02:00.412 --> 02:01.823
Yeah.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.208
Hey, you okay?

02:07.419 --> 02:08.913
Yes.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.338
I'm fine, thank you.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.700
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

02:40.911 --> 02:45.952
- So how'd we do?
- You did fine.

02:48.210 --> 02:51.294
- See anything?
- I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.340
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.960
Sorry.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.797
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

03:38.010 --> 03:41.592
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

03:41.805 --> 03:44.474
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

03:44.683 --> 03:48.633
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.846
How much time they giving you?

03:51.815 --> 03:53.393
Weeks.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.186
Maybe.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.861
Sorry to hear it.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.689
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.697
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.615
How much money are we laundering?

04:08.040 --> 04:10.957
At this time, $16,000.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.372
How long you been doing this?

04:15.464 --> 04:17.871
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.550
Yeah, apparently.

04:19.760 --> 04:25.098
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar...

04:25.307 --> 04:28.842
...minus my fee,
which is 17 percent...

04:29.061 --> 04:32.227
...comes to $9960.

04:32.439 --> 04:36.057
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.811
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.402
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.866
Make hay
while the sun is still shining.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.167
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

04:55.379 --> 04:58.664
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.377
Actually, I...

05:06.265 --> 05:09.052
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.224
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.859
You know, I never did call her.

05:22.322 --> 05:27.031
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.790
God, Walt.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.876
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.457
I am. Positive is good.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.873
I'm all for positive...

05:43.093 --> 05:47.554
...but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.140
It...

05:49.641 --> 05:52.215
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.811
I know.

05:54.021 --> 05:57.390
Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

05:57.608 --> 05:59.684
You know, forgive me.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.023
Look...

06:04.239 --> 06:07.157
...I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if...

06:07.367 --> 06:08.945
If...

06:09.870 --> 06:11.150
...I'm no longer around.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.617
I just need to get that straight,
that's all.

06:18.462 --> 06:22.162
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

06:23.675 --> 06:27.294
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

06:28.055 --> 06:32.266
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

06:33.685 --> 06:37.019
A 30-minute discourse...

06:37.231 --> 06:40.682
...about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

06:40.901 --> 06:44.186
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them, you know.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.693
I'll be lucky
if I get a word in edgewise.

07:05.843 --> 07:09.508
I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.057
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.353
Yeah.

07:26.196 --> 07:30.408
- We should do something.
- Yeah, we should.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.073
No, something else.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.072
We should go somewhere.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.075
Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

07:39.293 --> 07:41.416
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.170
Georgia O'Keeffe.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.292
She's a painter.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.878
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

07:51.096 --> 07:52.970
No, is that bad?

07:53.182 --> 07:57.927
- Boy, you need some educating.
- Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.265
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.064
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

08:05.277 --> 08:07.850
So romantic.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.741
Yup, we're going. Get up.

08:11.533 --> 08:15.780
Why can't we just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.285
It's the shit.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.581
A little culture won't kill you.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.375
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginae.

08:25.797 --> 08:26.877
Really?

08:30.636 --> 08:33.209
- Is there still cereal?
- Yeah.

08:40.479 --> 08:43.349
Yo, if I know you, leave a message.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.317
Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.730
- Hello? Jesse, pick up...
- Hold on, hold on.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.986
Sorry, one sec.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.736
- What?
- I've been trying to reach you.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.119
Where's your drop phone?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.915
- I've been busy.
- Well, clear your social calendar.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.664
- We have to cook.
- What? Today?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.291
No, you'll need today at least
to gather supplies.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.753
Now, we're going to need
all new glassware...

09:14.972 --> 09:17.463
...heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

09:17.683 --> 09:20.553
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.723
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.691
Smoking marijuana,
eating Cheetos and masturbating...

09:26.900 --> 09:29.391
...do not constitute plans
in my book.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.687
Well, screw you and your book, man,
all right?

09:31.905 --> 09:34.859
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

09:35.075 --> 09:39.287
- You're going to a museum, huh?
- Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.533
- Georgia O'Keeffe?
- She's a painter, duh.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.208
She does these vagina pictures.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.538
Or paintings, or just painted.
I don't know.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.165
What are you even talking about?

09:49.381 --> 09:52.548
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

09:52.759 --> 09:54.835
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.387
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.057
Let me explain something to you.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.303
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.732
- Tuesday? Four days straight?
- Like it or not, we have no choice.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.227
Yeah? And why exactly is that?

10:13.197 --> 10:15.403
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.857
- What?
- It's losing its chemical potency.

10:18.076 --> 10:21.196
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you...

10:21.413 --> 10:22.694
Hell, no.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.536
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.957
You have a paper and pencil?

10:29.379 --> 10:33.247
- Come on.
- All right, all right. Go.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.338
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.760
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.012
I really wish
you didn't have to do this.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.635
Me too.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.596
But I'll be back before you know it...

10:45.812 --> 10:48.517
...and you can always call
if you need me.

10:48.732 --> 10:53.311
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.241
Love you.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.087
- Fly safe, okay?
- Okay.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.600
The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading...

11:35.821 --> 11:37.196
...of passengers only.

11:37.406 --> 11:39.279
No parking.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.667
Attention, passengers:
Please maintain visual contact...

11:50.878 --> 11:53.203
...with your personal belongings
at all times.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.829
Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated...

11:56.049 --> 11:58.007
...by airport personnel.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.597
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

12:08.812 --> 12:11.434
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.807
Yeah. Did you get everything?
All six?

12:14.026 --> 12:16.351
- Yeah.
- With reflux condensers?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.148
Yes. Like I said, yes.

12:18.363 --> 12:23.025
- Just go. Drive. Go, go.
- Okay.

12:24.536 --> 12:27.288
Good morning to you too, man.

13:23.804 --> 13:27.089
- Stupid...
- Three entire bags of Funyuns?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.633
What? Funyuns are awesome.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.891
- God.
- Hey, more for me.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.974
How about something
with some protein maybe?

13:35.190 --> 13:37.479
Something green, huh?

13:37.693 --> 13:42.105
Man, I'm getting no service.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.737
How are you even alive?

13:46.535 --> 13:50.367
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

13:50.581 --> 13:52.289
Yeah, I've got a signal.

13:55.252 --> 13:59.036
- Hey, let me use yours, would you?
- Absolutely not.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.414
I have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.673
- You know that.
- It's not business, all right?

14:03.886 --> 14:05.166
- It's personal.
- Oh, personal.

14:05.387 --> 14:08.174
- What, female?
- Maybe.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.217
Absolutely. That's all I need.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.723
Skyler hits redial
and some stripper answers.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.637
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
Dickwad.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.640
Sorry. My wife checks.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.814
- Drinking water?
- Yup.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.691
Is that all we've got?

14:25.908 --> 14:29.822
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

14:35.709 --> 14:36.989
Oh, God.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.840
No, not there.
That is our workstation.

14:47.054 --> 14:50.339
- Oh, our "workstation."
- That's right.

14:51.183 --> 14:54.766
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

14:54.978 --> 14:56.520
Considering it's our only set...

14:56.730 --> 14:59.684
...and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

15:05.531 --> 15:08.864
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

17:11.740 --> 17:13.982
Two-point-three-five pounds.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.953
Two-point-three-five.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.822
That's the last of it.

17:21.291 --> 17:24.826
- How many total?
- Nineteen.

17:25.379 --> 17:28.048
So dollar-wise?

17:28.257 --> 17:29.881
How much?

17:30.092 --> 17:33.212
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...

17:33.428 --> 17:38.174
...that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds, at...

17:38.392 --> 17:40.764
- What are we selling for these days?
- Forty a pound.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.765
- Forty thousand dollars?
- Hey, you said raise the prices.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.851
All right, that's 40 times 42...

17:47.067 --> 17:50.103
...minus distribution charges...

17:52.364 --> 17:53.527
What?

17:55.158 --> 17:56.439
What?

17:57.202 --> 17:59.527
Six hundred seventy-two
thousand dollars.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.368
- All in?
- No.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.209
Each.

18:05.836 --> 18:06.832
Each?

18:08.255 --> 18:10.711
- Each.
- Six hundred and...?

18:10.924 --> 18:13.380
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

18:13.594 --> 18:17.045
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

18:17.264 --> 18:21.973
Hey, come high, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

18:22.936 --> 18:26.021
Yes! Yes!

18:29.985 --> 18:32.902
Well, there goes the generator.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.438
I think that's it for the gas.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.152
Perfect timing, yo.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.238
- How do you figure that?
- What do you mean?

18:40.454 --> 18:41.450
We're done cooking.

18:41.663 --> 18:44.581
I am not done
until this barrel is empty.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.954
Look at this.

18:46.168 --> 18:49.418
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

18:49.630 --> 18:52.749
- Come on, where's your ambition?
- Jesus. Seriously?

18:52.966 --> 18:55.255
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

18:55.469 --> 18:58.423
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane...

18:58.639 --> 19:01.556
...and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.340
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off?

19:04.561 --> 19:07.099
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

19:07.314 --> 19:09.852
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the sizzle...

19:10.067 --> 19:11.561
...and glass up the rest.

19:11.777 --> 19:12.773
Come on.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.857
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

19:16.073 --> 19:17.733
Grand Slam?

19:17.950 --> 19:20.108
Hot shower?

19:20.327 --> 19:21.442
A bed?

19:26.250 --> 19:30.164
- Separate rooms.
- Yeah, that's a given.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.750
What the hell?

19:35.425 --> 19:38.510
What the...? The battery's dead.

19:41.181 --> 19:45.261
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place...

19:45.853 --> 19:47.098
...where did you put them?

19:47.312 --> 19:52.058
- I left them right here in the ignition.
- Son of a bitch.

19:52.276 --> 19:54.434
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

19:54.653 --> 19:56.195
- The buzzer didn't buzz.
- The what?

19:56.405 --> 19:58.647
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in...

19:58.866 --> 20:00.490
...to let you know the battery's on.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.361
I know that. It didn't buzz.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.866
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

20:05.080 --> 20:07.998
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

20:08.208 --> 20:10.331
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

20:10.544 --> 20:13.165
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

20:13.380 --> 20:16.001
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

20:16.216 --> 20:17.295
The buzzer did not buzz.

20:17.509 --> 20:19.668
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.511
Yes, I see your point.

20:21.722 --> 20:24.343
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

20:24.558 --> 20:27.761
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

20:27.978 --> 20:30.599
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.186
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.309
- Jesus.
- Okay, just...

20:39.239 --> 20:43.451
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.285
Okay.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.694
How?

20:55.923 --> 20:58.081
You gonna be okay?

20:58.592 --> 21:00.466
Oh, damn it.

21:02.054 --> 21:03.845
What's it taste like?

21:04.389 --> 21:05.504
Bad, huh?

21:12.814 --> 21:15.021
This is good.
This is good. Right here.

21:15.234 --> 21:18.270
Okay. There.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.234
Here. Red to red, black to black.

21:26.954 --> 21:31.865
Positive, negative.
All right. Start it up.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.746
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

21:37.965 --> 21:40.882
- You have to really pull.
- I am.

21:41.093 --> 21:42.884
No, really pull, not like a girl.

21:43.095 --> 21:45.764
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulling.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.432
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

21:51.812 --> 21:52.926
Oh, my God.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.266
Oh, jeez.

22:20.591 --> 22:24.256
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just...

22:25.596 --> 22:27.090
Well done.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.224
God.

22:51.788 --> 22:55.204
Come on, you bitches.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.493
Hear me now.

22:59.171 --> 23:01.080
Damn it.

23:08.263 --> 23:09.923
Stupid.

23:14.019 --> 23:16.261
Okay, now we have to use
your phone.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.603
This is ruined. Do you understand?
Just ruined.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.815
You hooked it up wrong
and blew it up.

23:21.026 --> 23:23.778
No, no, no.
That is not what happened.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.102
How do you know?

23:25.322 --> 23:28.691
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

23:28.909 --> 23:30.652
- That's what I know.
- There was a fire.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.696
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

23:32.913 --> 23:34.989
Is that what you were...?
You were thinking?

23:35.207 --> 23:37.034
Now that we have
identified the problem...

23:37.251 --> 23:39.457
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

23:39.670 --> 23:44.711
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

23:44.925 --> 23:47.167
Your wife is not gonna notice
one little call.

23:48.929 --> 23:51.052
Mr. White, come on.

23:51.557 --> 23:52.719
God.

23:52.933 --> 23:58.010
All right, look, just make it snappy.

23:58.230 --> 24:01.314
- Roaming drains the battery.
- All right.

24:04.570 --> 24:06.313
Yo, Skinny, hey.

24:06.530 --> 24:09.697
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

24:09.908 --> 24:14.369
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

24:14.580 --> 24:16.406
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

24:16.623 --> 24:19.079
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

24:19.293 --> 24:20.621
All right, so you ready?

24:20.836 --> 24:24.916
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

24:25.132 --> 24:29.758
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

24:29.970 --> 24:31.797
All right...
No, big arrows, giant arrows.

24:32.014 --> 24:34.220
They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

24:34.433 --> 24:37.683
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

24:37.895 --> 24:40.765
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

24:40.981 --> 24:43.733
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

24:43.942 --> 24:48.189
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

24:48.405 --> 24:50.196
About another 15 miles.

24:50.407 --> 24:53.159
- Really? That far?
- Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

24:53.368 --> 24:56.453
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

24:56.663 --> 25:00.364
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

25:00.584 --> 25:04.083
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
Bring water.

25:04.296 --> 25:05.921
Leave now.

25:06.507 --> 25:07.965
Here.

25:08.175 --> 25:09.799
He's coming.

25:16.183 --> 25:18.638
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel...

25:18.852 --> 25:21.260
...who broke his leg
mountain biking...

25:21.480 --> 25:24.149
...and he had to drink urine for...

25:24.358 --> 25:27.228
You know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

25:27.444 --> 25:33.565
He said it tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

25:36.286 --> 25:39.489
Look, we should just call, you know?

25:39.706 --> 25:43.490
I'll be quick, just be like,
"Yo, where are you?"

25:45.879 --> 25:47.338
All right.

25:57.850 --> 25:59.474
Come on.

26:01.353 --> 26:03.642
Yo. Yo, where are you?

26:04.565 --> 26:06.142
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

26:06.358 --> 26:08.896
Yes, he's almost here.

26:09.111 --> 26:12.895
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

26:13.115 --> 26:15.570
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

26:15.784 --> 26:17.777
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

26:17.995 --> 26:21.079
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

26:21.290 --> 26:23.366
Wait, wait. What river?

26:24.543 --> 26:25.954
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

26:26.170 --> 26:28.707
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

26:28.922 --> 26:31.129
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you...?

26:33.468 --> 26:35.046
Phone's dead.

26:39.850 --> 26:41.593
Now what?

26:44.438 --> 26:47.641
Mr. White, what now?

26:49.109 --> 26:52.478
Oh, come on. Seriously?

27:26.021 --> 27:27.764
What's this?

27:30.150 --> 27:32.059
I'm trying to...

27:32.528 --> 27:35.019
...trickle-charge the battery.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.821
Seriously?

27:38.242 --> 27:40.281
Just by turning that thing?

27:40.494 --> 27:42.285
The commutator.

27:42.996 --> 27:45.452
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

27:46.834 --> 27:50.617
Usually this little piston engine
turns it...

27:51.713 --> 27:54.917
...but considering that it's lying here
completely totaled...

27:59.513 --> 28:01.256
Anyway.

28:03.976 --> 28:06.301
Apply a little elbow grease.

28:06.854 --> 28:10.898
It'll take longer, a lot longer...

28:11.358 --> 28:13.979
...but theoretically...

28:15.195 --> 28:17.104
...it should work.

28:18.699 --> 28:20.608
Theoretically.

28:25.706 --> 28:27.330
It has to work.

28:28.208 --> 28:30.035
You understand?

28:39.720 --> 28:41.428
Can I try?

28:46.226 --> 28:47.685
Yeah.

29:22.804 --> 29:24.631
How much longer?

29:26.808 --> 29:28.468
I don't know.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.569
Now?

29:45.786 --> 29:47.410
Hey.

29:48.247 --> 29:50.038
Mr. White.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.762
Hey.

30:06.265 --> 30:07.640
Yeah?

30:09.810 --> 30:13.261
Yo, man, you hanging in?

30:14.106 --> 30:15.980
Yeah, I'm good.

30:18.318 --> 30:21.853
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

30:24.825 --> 30:27.398
No, give it a little longer...

30:27.619 --> 30:29.695
...just to make sure we're...

30:44.178 --> 30:46.847
Methylamine doesn't spoil...

30:47.055 --> 30:48.514
...does it?

30:51.518 --> 30:55.302
No. That's not why we're here.

31:07.326 --> 31:08.868
Yo.

31:09.536 --> 31:10.912
Lie much?

31:19.046 --> 31:20.623
Here, push.

31:35.229 --> 31:38.146
Okay, okay, okay.

31:39.608 --> 31:41.019
Now.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.147
Go on.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.611
Please, please, please.

32:07.010 --> 32:09.501
Yes. Yes.

32:12.808 --> 32:16.307
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.011
No. God.

32:21.024 --> 32:24.144
Please. Please.

32:41.211 --> 32:44.497
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

32:44.715 --> 32:47.669
Why? Why?

32:53.390 --> 32:55.383
Mr. White.

32:55.601 --> 32:57.225
Mr. White!

33:04.610 --> 33:06.436
What are you doing?

33:08.071 --> 33:09.779
Mr. White?

33:11.074 --> 33:12.984
Oh, God.

33:30.469 --> 33:32.592
I have this coming.

33:35.182 --> 33:36.641
What?

33:39.311 --> 33:41.434
I have it coming.

33:43.482 --> 33:45.558
I deserve this.

33:46.109 --> 33:47.983
Hey, snap out of it.

33:48.195 --> 33:52.145
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

33:52.366 --> 33:53.860
Right?

33:55.869 --> 33:58.704
All I ever managed to do...

33:59.081 --> 34:02.247
...was worry and disappoint them...

34:03.043 --> 34:04.786
...and lie.

34:06.380 --> 34:07.578
Oh, God.

34:08.590 --> 34:10.713
All the lies.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.427
I can't even...

34:14.638 --> 34:17.639
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

34:18.851 --> 34:21.520
You know what? Screw this.

34:21.728 --> 34:25.311
I'm walking. You can come or not.

34:27.109 --> 34:29.814
Where's my other shoe?

34:31.363 --> 34:34.281
Jesse. Jesse.

34:37.411 --> 34:39.320
Your body...

34:39.538 --> 34:43.370
...is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

34:45.127 --> 34:48.662
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

34:49.047 --> 34:51.336
And when they're gone...

34:51.884 --> 34:55.335
...your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

34:56.054 --> 35:01.641
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

35:01.852 --> 35:05.850
You go marching out there...

35:06.064 --> 35:09.932
...and within an hour,
you will be dead.

35:10.152 --> 35:14.232
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now...

35:14.448 --> 35:16.357
...and think of something scientific.

35:16.575 --> 35:19.825
Something...
Something scientific, right.

35:20.037 --> 35:22.991
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

35:23.207 --> 35:25.876
You made poison out of beans, yo.

35:26.835 --> 35:29.326
All right, look. We got...

35:29.546 --> 35:34.671
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

35:34.885 --> 35:36.924
How about you take
some of these chemicals...

35:37.137 --> 35:39.711
...and mix up some rocket fuel?

35:39.932 --> 35:42.849
And we can just send up
a signal flare.

35:43.060 --> 35:46.345
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help...

35:46.563 --> 35:49.268
...or a homing device...

35:49.483 --> 35:51.310
...or build a new battery or...

35:51.527 --> 35:53.353
Or wait, no.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.812
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV...

35:56.031 --> 35:59.482
...and build it into something
completely different?

35:59.701 --> 36:02.572
You know, like a...
Like a dune buggy.

36:02.788 --> 36:06.239
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or...

36:07.125 --> 36:11.419
What? Hey. What is it?

36:12.548 --> 36:13.958
What?

36:14.883 --> 36:17.754
Do you have any money?

36:17.970 --> 36:19.084
Change, I mean. Coins.

36:19.304 --> 36:22.091
- Yeah, I got a bunch from the...
- Okay.

36:22.307 --> 36:24.134
- Yes.
- Gather them.

36:24.351 --> 36:28.218
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws...

36:28.438 --> 36:31.807
...and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

36:32.025 --> 36:35.608
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

36:35.821 --> 36:38.027
- Solid zinc, okay.
- And... And bring me...

36:38.240 --> 36:40.612
Bring me brake pads.

36:40.826 --> 36:44.409
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

36:44.621 --> 36:47.373
- Okay. Brake pads, okay.
- Brake pads.

36:51.795 --> 36:52.958
What are we building?

36:53.755 --> 36:56.709
- You said it yourself.
- A robot?

36:57.676 --> 36:59.051
- A battery.
- Yes.

36:59.261 --> 37:01.135
Move!

37:12.524 --> 37:16.569
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

37:16.778 --> 37:18.937
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

37:19.698 --> 37:22.901
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

37:24.328 --> 37:27.032
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

37:27.247 --> 37:28.907
Remember the electrolytes?

37:30.292 --> 37:31.455
Well, think about it.

37:31.960 --> 37:35.329
A battery is a galvanic cell.

37:35.547 --> 37:38.299
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode...

37:38.509 --> 37:40.631
...separated by an electrolyte, right?

37:41.470 --> 37:43.427
- Right.
- Yeah, well, anyway.

37:43.639 --> 37:47.257
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide...

37:47.476 --> 37:49.682
...and graphite
from your brake pads.

37:49.895 --> 37:54.058
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

37:54.274 --> 37:58.521
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

37:59.238 --> 38:01.361
Then... Here, I'll show you.

38:01.573 --> 38:04.111
On the opposite side is our anode.

38:04.576 --> 38:06.154
This.

38:07.579 --> 38:09.121
It's zinc.

38:09.331 --> 38:14.408
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

38:14.628 --> 38:18.044
- So the sponge is the electrolyte?
- Yeah.

38:18.257 --> 38:22.124
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

38:22.344 --> 38:26.424
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

38:27.432 --> 38:28.891
Good.

38:29.768 --> 38:34.679
Good. And now, what shall we use...

38:34.898 --> 38:37.568
...to conduct
this beautiful current with?

38:37.985 --> 38:43.110
What one particular element
comes to mind?

38:48.912 --> 38:50.786
Wire.

38:52.958 --> 38:54.452
Copper.

38:54.668 --> 38:56.708
- Oh, I mean...
- Copper.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.331
Right.

38:58.922 --> 39:03.418
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

39:03.635 --> 39:06.553
And how many cells will we need?

39:06.763 --> 39:09.634
We've only got material enough
for six.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.723
Okay.

39:19.651 --> 39:22.771
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

39:22.988 --> 39:24.447
All right.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.408
Cathode.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.118
Anode.

39:35.334 --> 39:38.335
Damn. That is good.

39:38.545 --> 39:41.831
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

40:01.818 --> 40:02.814
Come on.

40:46.446 --> 40:49.483
Attention, passengers:
Please maintain visual contact...

40:49.700 --> 40:51.988
...with your personal belongings
at all times.

40:52.202 --> 40:54.693
Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated by...

40:54.913 --> 40:56.657
How's the...?

40:58.917 --> 41:00.411
It's fine.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.716
I know I can trust you to...

41:16.268 --> 41:18.059
Yeah.

41:19.897 --> 41:22.684
Hey, whatever happens...

41:23.150 --> 41:25.557
...your family will get your share.

41:28.488 --> 41:29.983
Thank you.

41:38.957 --> 41:40.582
So...

41:44.171 --> 41:47.587
...I'll be hearing from you, yeah?

41:51.428 --> 41:52.922
Yeah.

42:11.657 --> 42:13.614
How's everyone doing?

42:16.787 --> 42:19.538
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

42:20.791 --> 42:24.789
- I know. I know, enough already. It's...
- I'm teasing.

42:25.003 --> 42:26.961
Everything in its time.

42:28.882 --> 42:31.420
Walt, I have your scan results.

42:32.803 --> 42:36.338
- Yeah.
- You're showing signs of remission.

42:39.977 --> 42:42.550
- Oh, my God.
- I wanna clarify.

42:42.771 --> 42:45.476
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

42:45.691 --> 42:48.063
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

42:48.610 --> 42:50.318
To classify someone
as in remission...

42:50.529 --> 42:53.234
...we only need to determine
that the tumor hasn't grown.

42:53.448 --> 42:55.821
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

42:56.535 --> 42:57.566
Technically speaking...

42:57.786 --> 43:00.822
...a tumor can remain
the exact same size it was before...

43:01.039 --> 43:03.495
...and the patient
could still be in remission.

43:03.709 --> 43:07.243
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage III adenocarcinoma...

43:07.462 --> 43:09.455
...I'd like to see, I hope to see...

43:09.673 --> 43:13.291
...at least a 25- to 35-percent
reduction in tumor mass...

43:13.510 --> 43:19.015
...something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

43:19.224 --> 43:21.016
Everybody still with me?

43:22.561 --> 43:26.179
And how has my cancer responded?

43:26.398 --> 43:29.767
Walt, your tumor has shrunk
by 80 percent.

43:35.699 --> 43:37.526
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

43:37.743 --> 43:39.985
Wait, I'm really... I'm confused.

43:40.204 --> 43:42.611
Is...? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

43:43.624 --> 43:47.871
- Mom, yeah.
- Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

43:48.837 --> 43:51.209
- Okay, but, I'm... Wait...
- Sweetheart, you were right.

43:51.423 --> 43:54.175
- It's very good news.
- It's very good news.

43:54.384 --> 43:57.421
- Oh, my God.
- My God, are you kidding me?

43:57.638 --> 44:01.849
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

44:10.609 --> 44:12.269
That's great.

44:13.946 --> 44:17.149
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

44:17.366 --> 44:21.233
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

44:21.453 --> 44:24.573
It's okay. This is fairly common.

44:25.457 --> 44:27.165
See that scary-looking thing there?

44:27.960 --> 44:31.210
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

44:31.797 --> 44:34.667
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

44:34.883 --> 44:36.959
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

44:37.177 --> 44:40.095
Tissue inflammation? I...

44:40.305 --> 44:42.262
Are you sure about that? I mean, I...

44:42.474 --> 44:48.263
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

44:49.690 --> 44:51.481
- What?
- You probably have a tear...

44:51.692 --> 44:53.269
...in your esophagus
from coughing.

44:53.485 --> 44:56.272
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

44:56.655 --> 44:59.858
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

45:00.075 --> 45:02.946
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

45:03.161 --> 45:05.699
- I'm sorry, I just...
- No more secrets, Walt.

45:05.914 --> 45:09.615
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

45:11.170 --> 45:14.005
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

45:14.214 --> 45:16.123
But now at least
we have some options...

45:16.341 --> 45:19.212
...the most important of which
is time.

45:20.470 --> 45:22.712
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

45:22.931 --> 45:26.715
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

45:30.189 --> 45:32.062
- Yes.
- Yeah.

45:32.274 --> 45:33.437
Oh, my God.
