00:16.375 --> 00:19.744
The city's called Duke
The state's called New Mexico

00:26.135 --> 00:30.133
Among the gangsters
The gringos' fame is inflated

00:30.932 --> 00:35.428
'Cause of the new drug they created

00:43.821 --> 00:49.575
They say the colour is blue
And the quality pure

00:55.750 --> 00:59.748
This potent drug's runnin'
Through the city

01:00.588 --> 01:05.085
And no one could stop it
If they wanted to

01:07.638 --> 01:13.759
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect

01:14.687 --> 01:20.772
Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now

01:23.404 --> 01:27.533
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face

01:28.243 --> 01:31.778
The cartel's 'bout respect
And they ain't forgiving

01:32.956 --> 01:39.540
But that homey's dead
He just doesn't know it yet

01:55.188 --> 02:01.772
Heisenberg's fame has got
Down to Michoacan

02:04.406 --> 02:08.486
From way far away
They want to taste that meth

02:09.203 --> 02:14.328
That blue stuff has crossed the border

02:22.049 --> 02:23.959
Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name

02:33.103 --> 02:37.516
Looks just like Mexico
In all the drugs it's hiding

02:37.983 --> 02:43.903
Except there's a gringo boss
And he's known as "Heisenberg"

02:46.617 --> 02:52.038
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect

02:54.167 --> 02:58.959
Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now

03:02.467 --> 03:06.596
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face

03:07.181 --> 03:10.965
The fury of the cartel
Ain't no one escaped it yet

03:11.477 --> 03:15.391
But that homey's dead

03:15.606 --> 03:18.892
He just doesn't know it yet
