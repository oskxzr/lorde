01:36.888 --> 01:39.640
All right, everybody. Listen up.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.351
Tuco Salamanca.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.479
For those of you who were
not with us this morning

01:44.562 --> 01:46.772
we raided his headquarters.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.816
Also his last-known address.

01:48.983 --> 01:53.112
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.239
We netted a bunch
of his lieutenants.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.907
The big man himself
smelled us coming.

01:57.325 --> 02:01.745
So study the face.
Study the file.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.331
Get a big old raging hard-on

02:04.499 --> 02:07.126
at the idea of catching
this piece of shit.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.754
My apologies
to the H.R. department.

02:10.922 --> 02:14.800
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.552
All right.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.679
On the hit parade, 1998.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.848
Reputed to have whacked
one "Dog" Paulson

02:21.015 --> 02:22.724
back when our homegrown bandidos

02:22.892 --> 02:25.686
were wresting the crank trade
away from the So Cal biker gangs.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.314
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

02:29.482 --> 02:33.152
And for my money, seeing how
he customarily deals with rivals,

02:33.319 --> 02:35.988
I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance

02:36.156 --> 02:38.448
of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.618
Hats over your heart
for that dirtball.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.829
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that

02:43.997 --> 02:45.558
but as usual,
we couldn't make it stick.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.333
Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.462
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.883
Yeah, yeah. I know it's... We all
know what's going on down there.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.930
We sure as hell don't want it
going on up here,

02:58.052 --> 02:59.887
which brings us to the good news.

03:00.054 --> 03:04.600
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.687
- This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
- No-Doze.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.399
Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law,

03:12.567 --> 03:14.234
a.k.a. Gonzo.

03:14.402 --> 03:18.906
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body...

03:19.073 --> 03:21.593
Either hiding it there or pulling it out.
We're still not sure.

03:21.659 --> 03:25.162
...when he got his arm crushed clean off.
Heh, heh.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.415
Anyone wanna see the photos, they'
re on my website. Hilarious.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.584
Anyway. The upshot is

03:30.752 --> 03:36.131
we got us a nice, big, juicy,
bloody fingerprint

03:36.299 --> 03:39.760
which belongs to Señor Tuco.

03:40.094 --> 03:43.555
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.226
That is,
provided we find this guy.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.729
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

03:50.897 --> 03:53.440
- Yes.
- Yes.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.067
What the hell was that? Jesus.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.778
Wanna try that again?

03:57.946 --> 04:01.198
- Do you wanna find this guy?
- Yes!

04:01.366 --> 04:03.951
- Are we going to find this guy?
- Yes!

04:04.118 --> 04:05.452
- Louder, damn it!
- Yes!

04:05.620 --> 04:07.579
Give me a "hell, yeah!"
Hell, yeah!

04:07.747 --> 04:09.498
- Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

04:09.666 --> 04:13.210
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.299
They ain't gonna find him.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.718
Guy is in México by now.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.930
Appearances, Gomey. Tsk, tsk.
It's all about appearances.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.476
Listen, I gotta take
some personal time.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.395
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

04:32.647 --> 04:36.149
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.486
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.656
Damn. You don't think he...?

04:44.742 --> 04:46.243
Holler if you need me.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.329
All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

06:01.152 --> 06:05.572
- This is the most recent photo.
- We haven't taken many lately, so...

06:06.783 --> 06:09.910
But that's what
he looks like now.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.329
Without the hair.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.375
Hey, it's me.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.087
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate
you sparing us your day off.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.714
No worries.
Happy to help.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.175
Yeah, this is helpful.
Good.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.761
What about height and weight?
Five eleven,

06:27.929 --> 06:30.097
most recently, about 170.

06:30.598 --> 06:34.726
One sixty-five.
That's what I weigh.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.771
I guess he weighs a little less.

06:37.939 --> 06:41.233
That's fine. That's close enough.
Good.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.777
What about other
distinguishing features?

06:43.945 --> 06:46.279
Tattoos or moles or scars?

06:46.447 --> 06:51.535
Anything that might help us.
Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.537
That's fine.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.580
Is that the list of medications?
Yes.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.291
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

06:58.459 --> 07:02.212
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.923
Has he been depressed?

07:09.470 --> 07:14.891
He's, um, been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.810
Yeah.

07:17.812 --> 07:21.314
Last night, he was, uh, agitated.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.649
Agitated?

07:22.817 --> 07:27.320
Yeah. When he came home last
night, he was agitated, upset.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.613
Upset in general?

07:28.781 --> 07:31.241
Or upset because
of something particular?

07:32.243 --> 07:33.452
Um...

07:34.829 --> 07:40.000
When I asked him what
was wrong, he said:

07:41.169 --> 07:42.752
"I don't know where to begin."

07:44.088 --> 07:46.840
Then he just walked out of the
room... Out of the bathroom.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.675
I was in the tub,
I was taking a bath.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.928
...and when I came out about
10 minutes later, he was gone.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.723
Nothing else missing?

07:55.975 --> 07:59.936
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.815
But... What about the phone call?

08:05.943 --> 08:07.360
Uh... I'm looking into it.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.490
What phone call?
Walt's cell phone rang.

08:11.657 --> 08:16.036
He pulled it out, looked at
it, and didn't answer it.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.537
But then, a short time after,

08:17.705 --> 08:19.873
he wandered out of the bathroom.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.875
I mean,

08:22.043 --> 08:23.919
couldn't that be, uh,

08:24.086 --> 08:26.004
important, right?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.635
Anything else you can think of?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.387
Anything else. Um...

08:34.555 --> 08:36.723
No. I called
the credit card providers,

08:36.891 --> 08:42.062
and there's no report
of any recent activity.

08:42.230 --> 08:46.608
I... Let's see. I checked with
every hospital within 50 miles.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.902
Every police station.
Every morgue.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.780
So, no, I really don't...
I don't have anything else.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.492
I was actually hoping
that you had something else,

08:55.660 --> 08:58.203
being that you're the expert.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.042
I'm sorry.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.585
No worries.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.629
I think this is
good enough to start.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.548
Gives us plenty to work on.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.261
Mrs. White.
Thank you.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.888
Walter.
Thank you.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.943
So that cell-phone call she's
talking about? I ran it.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.070
And?
Never happened.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.738
No record of it.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.241
Second cell phone.
Yeah. I'm thinking.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.759
I understand.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.554
Out.

11:22.556 --> 11:23.723
Get away from me!

11:26.477 --> 11:28.895
Settle down, bitch.

11:29.063 --> 11:33.400
- You gonna shoot me, huh?
- Shoot me in here!

11:33.567 --> 11:35.902
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

11:36.070 --> 11:38.154
That way, you have to clean it up!

11:42.159 --> 11:43.535
It's your ride, retard.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.662
I ain't gotta clean jack.
Now get out.

11:56.006 --> 11:56.606
Get up.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.146
Oh, my God.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.440
Don't do this, Tuco.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.193
No more posters?

13:40.861 --> 13:43.488
Walter Jr.'s making more.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.202
Thank you, Marie.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.792
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.546
I mean, he just doesn't
strike me as the type.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.381
He'll turn up.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.726
Okay, the whole tiara thing,

14:13.894 --> 14:17.480
- I just find it bewildering that...
- Marie.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.567
- You didn't believe that...
- Marie.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.237
Not now.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.165
Empty your pockets.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.363
Thought your name was Heisenberg,

16:30.698 --> 16:33.366
"Walter Hartwell White."

16:33.534 --> 16:36.786
Heisenberg is kind of
a pseudonym.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.541
You know, a business name.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.174
Yeah.

16:54.179 --> 16:58.099
I like doing business
with a family man.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.893
There's always
a lot of collateral.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.639
Answer me one thing.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.311
Can I trust you?

17:44.271 --> 17:47.774
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.535
Sit down.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.171
DEA...

18:12.132 --> 18:14.634
hit my place of business
this morning.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.053
About a hundred cops
looking for me.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.139
You two haven't
been talking, right?

18:20.307 --> 18:23.392
No.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.481
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.734
Everybody except Gonzo.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.986
That's weird, right?

18:34.154 --> 18:37.657
I mean, don't you think
that that's weird?

18:37.825 --> 18:40.576
It's weird. Yes.

18:40.744 --> 18:44.747
Unusual.

18:45.624 --> 18:50.670
Last two days, I couldn't
get Gonzo on the phone.

18:51.922 --> 18:55.174
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.886
Explain to me.

18:59.346 --> 19:04.183
How is it my fault that that little
bitch did not know his place?

19:11.024 --> 19:13.025
I saw this coming.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.821
I can see the future, you know?

19:16.989 --> 19:21.701
It's this gift that I have
deep inside my head.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.330
I knew last night they were
gonna come try and bust me.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.040
Gonzo.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.795
He went and snitched to the cops!

19:32.963 --> 19:35.631
That lousy son of a bitch!

19:36.341 --> 19:42.555
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

19:42.723 --> 19:46.350
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut
him, I'm gonna skin him,

19:46.518 --> 19:50.062
and I'm gonna stuff his hide
for a heavy bag,

19:50.230 --> 19:54.400
and every time I hit him, it's going
to be like a lesson to myself!

19:54.568 --> 19:58.654
You never, never trust the
people that you love!

20:04.912 --> 20:10.875
So you plan to ice Gonzo,
like, future tense?

20:11.877 --> 20:13.002
What?

20:14.004 --> 20:16.339
You're saying, Tuco...

20:16.506 --> 20:19.342
You're saying that Gonzo

20:19.509 --> 20:23.930
is currently operating
as a police informant

20:24.097 --> 20:25.264
as far as you know?

20:28.435 --> 20:30.937
I'm very sorry to hear that.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.981
That's disappointing.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.608
Yeah.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.778
- I'd waste him too, yo.
- Shut up.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.363
Okay.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.449
They're out there
looking for me right now.

20:43.617 --> 20:46.452
They got ghetto birds
and black ops.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.790
I need to get high. Oh, fu...
I need to get good and high.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.756
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

20:59.508 --> 21:03.010
No, it's, uh... it's killer.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.762
Yeah, seriously.

21:08.141 --> 21:12.311
So I was thinking last night.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.146
I came up with this great idea.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.483
México.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.277
Mexico?

21:19.444 --> 21:23.072
Ha, ha. We'll disappear
way out in the jungle.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.032
We'll set you up in a superlab.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.743
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.829
And no Federales
are gonna mess with us

21:29.997 --> 21:32.248
because I got my people there.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.250
Connections.

21:34.876 --> 21:38.671
We're going to make beaucoup
bucks, Heisenberg, huh?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.965
Tuco, I...

21:41.425 --> 21:43.801
I have a wife and family.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.179
So what?
You'll get another one.

21:47.347 --> 21:51.434
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I can't just

21:51.601 --> 21:54.020
uproot my life like that.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.188
Yeah, man.
I mean, me neither.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.943
Who's talking to you?

22:04.406 --> 22:07.325
You need me, man,

22:07.492 --> 22:10.703
because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.041
Yeah.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.834
I'll tell you something, yo.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.879
You never tried nothing like it.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.214
Stink or no stink,

22:22.382 --> 22:26.886
one bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

22:28.847 --> 22:32.558
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.102
Careful when you hit it.

22:35.270 --> 22:38.147
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.736
It's got a secret ingredient.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.531
What secret ingredient?

22:48.617 --> 22:50.534
Chili powder.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.168
I hate chili powder.

23:03.173 --> 23:06.217
This blue magic, this is money.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.513
You keep cooking this,
Heisenberg.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.269
We're gonna rewrite
history with this.

23:22.025 --> 23:26.112
All right. Time to clean the
menudo out from between your ears.

23:26.738 --> 23:30.241
No, no, no. No,
I need him, Tuco.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.451
I need him very, very badly.

23:34.871 --> 23:35.955
He's my partner.

23:37.249 --> 23:41.252
And if he doesn't go,
I don't go.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.632
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now

23:46.800 --> 23:49.635
to smuggle us back down, and
they're gonna be here by sunset

23:49.803 --> 23:50.886
and you're gonna be
on that truck,

23:51.054 --> 23:53.305
or you're gonna be dead!

23:55.267 --> 23:56.851
And you...

23:58.145 --> 24:01.063
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.330
Where are you going?

24:18.498 --> 24:20.666
Louis is taking me
to the train station.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.626
We'll put these up.

24:22.794 --> 24:26.839
No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
He wants to help, let him help.

24:27.007 --> 24:30.468
I mean, how long has it
been since you've slept?

24:31.386 --> 24:34.763
Yeah, she's right, Sky. Why
don't you lay down a while?

24:35.390 --> 24:38.434
For Christ sake,
you got a bun in the oven.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.936
I got my cell if you need me.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.230
- Okay?
- Okay.

24:44.608 --> 24:48.319
- Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
- All right. Bye.

24:50.989 --> 24:55.743
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet

24:55.911 --> 24:57.786
bodes well.

24:58.872 --> 25:03.250
Well, I mean, if he...
You know.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.338
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.132
There's got to be something.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.218
Some detail that
we haven't picked up on.

25:13.220 --> 25:16.805
What about the second cell phone?
Ah, Jesus.

25:16.973 --> 25:20.643
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.146
Okay.
What are you talking about?

25:27.734 --> 25:32.571
Uh, the call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

25:32.739 --> 25:35.074
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

25:35.742 --> 25:38.035
No incoming, no dropped
calls, nothing.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.287
But his phone rang.
I heard it.

25:41.456 --> 25:46.710
Um, all right. Well, then if that's the
case, he must have a second phone.

25:48.922 --> 25:51.507
Wh... Why? What sense
would there be in that?

25:51.675 --> 25:54.760
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

25:57.264 --> 26:00.516
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.768
What does it mean?

26:02.936 --> 26:05.104
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

26:06.606 --> 26:09.441
It means Walt has a secret.

26:09.609 --> 26:13.487
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

26:14.447 --> 26:18.617
Okay. Oh, wow. Everyone. Okay.
Skyler, come on.

26:18.785 --> 26:22.746
He kept cancer
from you for weeks.

26:24.499 --> 26:28.586
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.213
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.757
Walt? Please.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.555
What about the marijuana?

26:39.973 --> 26:43.767
He's not on pot anymore.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.978
Says who? Him?

26:46.146 --> 26:48.314
Chemotherapy and
marijuana go together

26:48.481 --> 26:52.443
like apple pie and Chevrolet.

26:52.611 --> 26:57.323
Maybe he's addicted to the pot

26:57.490 --> 26:59.575
and he owes his drug
dealer a lot of money.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.870
Marie, you don't get
hooked on pot like that.

27:03.038 --> 27:06.040
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

27:07.375 --> 27:11.003
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.796
He may know something.

27:18.178 --> 27:22.014
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

27:23.391 --> 27:26.018
Then grasp.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.529
Excuse me, ma'am.

27:38.448 --> 27:41.617
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

27:42.410 --> 27:44.203
No. I'm afraid not.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.331
Why?
I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

27:47.499 --> 27:51.960
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

27:52.128 --> 27:55.381
He taught your son
chemistry in high school.

27:55.548 --> 27:58.926
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.762
That was a long time ago.
Yes, ma'am.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.641
It's my understanding that he and
Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

28:06.559 --> 28:08.644
Really?
Yeah.

28:08.812 --> 28:09.853
Huh.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.358
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.902
He really tried to motivate him.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.488
He was one of the
few teachers who cared.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.490
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.243
I'm so sorry to hear
about his illness.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.078
Please pass along
our best wishes.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.623
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.041
He's missing, actually.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.502
Just kind of walked off, or...

28:34.838 --> 28:37.005
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around,

28:37.173 --> 28:39.842
trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.760
That's terrible.

28:41.928 --> 28:44.263
Anything we can do to help.

28:44.431 --> 28:47.433
Well, if you could put me
in touch with your son...

28:47.600 --> 28:50.686
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.896
Jesse's not answering either
phone number I have for him,

28:53.064 --> 28:54.940
and no one seems to be home
at his house.

28:55.108 --> 28:59.278
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

29:00.488 --> 29:03.449
I don't necessarily.
I just, um...

29:03.616 --> 29:05.868
Are you with the police?
No, ma'am. Not at all.

29:08.955 --> 29:13.250
I'm with the
Drug Enforcement Administration.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.002
Oh, my God.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.295
Is my son in trouble?

29:16.463 --> 29:18.964
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.675
Do I need to get a lawyer?

29:21.843 --> 29:24.470
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this,

29:24.637 --> 29:27.097
coming here and asking
questions about my son and...

29:27.265 --> 29:29.785
Mrs. Pinkman, I swear to you,
I'm not here on official capacity.

29:29.893 --> 29:33.604
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.564
I just wanna find
my brother-in-law.

29:36.608 --> 29:40.819
His wife is worried sick, and
she's got a baby on the way.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.865
I'm sorry.
I would like to help you,

29:45.033 --> 29:47.576
but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

29:47.744 --> 29:51.163
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

29:52.457 --> 29:56.084
Well, thanks for your time.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.755
Oh, uh...

30:00.173 --> 30:02.341
If you could tell me
one more thing.

30:02.509 --> 30:06.929
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

30:07.764 --> 30:12.559
If he had spent half as much
time and money on his education

30:12.727 --> 30:16.980
as he has on that
ridiculous bouncing car...

30:18.358 --> 30:20.359
Low rider, huh?

30:21.694 --> 30:23.153
Gomey, hey.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.198
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out

30:26.366 --> 30:28.492
a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo

30:28.660 --> 30:33.121
registered to a one
Jesse Pinkman.

30:33.289 --> 30:36.458
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

30:36.626 --> 30:40.212
It's one of those jack-off low riders, so I'm
betting it's got a good shot that there is.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.757
If so, can you go ahead and get
me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.703
Chili powder.

31:13.079 --> 31:16.748
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

31:16.916 --> 31:18.292
Whatever, man.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.252
At least I tried something.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.379
Hey, it almost worked too.

31:22.547 --> 31:25.674
How's about
you leaving my gun, huh?

31:25.842 --> 31:28.719
First you boost it, then
you leave it in your house.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.596
My gun.

31:31.806 --> 31:37.436
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

31:37.604 --> 31:40.814
Well, at least
he wants you alive.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.642
Hey, I don't get it.

32:16.809 --> 32:19.853
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

32:20.021 --> 32:24.316
I don't know.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.611
Does it really matter?

32:27.779 --> 32:31.782
If he finds out that Gonzo is
dead and not a police informant,

32:31.950 --> 32:34.076
who does he automatically blame?

32:34.243 --> 32:36.119
Us.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.499
We need a plan.

32:42.669 --> 32:46.004
- Think, think.
- Let's just bum-rush him, man.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.465
You know, you crack him over
the head with something,

32:48.633 --> 32:50.509
and I'll go for his gun.

32:55.264 --> 32:58.308
Crack him over the head
with something?

33:01.437 --> 33:04.189
Hey, you got the C-bomb,
man, all right?

33:04.357 --> 33:06.066
You're as good
as checked out already.

33:06.234 --> 33:10.362
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.989
Just...

33:14.367 --> 33:17.119
Oh, so my life is not
the priority here,

33:17.286 --> 33:19.871
because I'm gonna be
dead soon anyway.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.540
That's your point?

33:21.708 --> 33:24.084
Uh, yeah.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.781
We gotta get him to take this.

33:54.949 --> 33:57.367
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chili P.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.411
That much has been established.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.581
So unless you can convince
him to booty bump...

34:07.920 --> 34:11.548
Eat!
We got a long ride ahead of us.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.400
Oye, tio.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
La comida esta
preparada, señor.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.360
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

34:32.528 --> 34:35.822
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.155
Take it easy, Tio.

35:17.657 --> 35:21.660
I will feed you.
I eat first. That's the deal.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.336
What?

35:39.053 --> 35:41.012
I get it, I get it, I get it.

35:41.180 --> 35:45.433
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.853
I tell you, Heisenberg.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.022
Old people.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.859
You feed them, huh?

35:54.026 --> 35:56.695
You put them in a really
nice crib in the country,

35:56.863 --> 36:00.282
and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.743
You better eat every bite of that.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.728
What did you do that for?

36:29.896 --> 36:31.855
God!

37:15.233 --> 37:18.443
Ha, ha, ha. Shh.
Hey, look. Look.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.278
There's nothing left.

37:46.681 --> 37:50.350
What?
What do you want?

37:56.524 --> 37:58.024
No.

37:58.192 --> 38:01.486
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

38:01.654 --> 38:02.946
Don't go there.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.253
Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?

38:20.339 --> 38:23.174
What, you don't like them?

38:25.511 --> 38:26.511
One ding.

38:26.679 --> 38:30.098
That means yes.
Tio don't like you.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.188
Why don't you like them, Tio?

38:40.401 --> 38:42.527
You don't trust them?

38:49.243 --> 38:54.539
Why don't you trust them, Tio?
Tuco, come on. He's...

38:54.999 --> 38:58.710
There clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.211
Shh.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.892
Did they do something
to you, Tio?

39:17.646 --> 39:19.356
Something that you don't like?

39:26.405 --> 39:30.408
What did they do to you?
What did you do to my tio?

39:30.576 --> 39:31.910
Nothing. Nothing.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.037
Bullshit! My tio does not lie!

39:34.205 --> 39:36.915
I don't know. I swear.
I don't know. I...

39:37.083 --> 39:41.920
No, I... Maybe it was... I did change
the channel on his TV, but...

39:42.088 --> 39:44.381
Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking,

39:44.548 --> 39:48.093
he was watching one of
those, um... Those telenovels

39:48.260 --> 39:50.929
with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.806
I told you not to
change the channel, man.

39:52.973 --> 39:56.017
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's it.

40:03.484 --> 40:08.279
Is that it, Tio?

40:09.949 --> 40:11.408
Did they change your mamitas?

40:20.543 --> 40:22.710
What are you telling me, Tio?

40:23.421 --> 40:24.754
Huh?

40:25.464 --> 40:26.798
Are they punking me?

40:42.106 --> 40:44.607
Hey. No.

40:44.775 --> 40:48.236
No, man. No.

40:48.404 --> 40:49.904
Come here! Aah!
No.

40:50.072 --> 40:53.658
No, no, Tuco.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.501
Tuco, no. Tuco.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.674
- Tuco.
- Shut up!

41:21.687 --> 41:25.648
No. Please, no. God.
Please, no.

41:25.816 --> 41:28.359
No, God.
I don't wanna die.

41:28.527 --> 41:30.528
Tell me what you did, Walter!

41:30.696 --> 41:34.032
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

41:34.700 --> 41:37.994
No!
Tell me what you did!

41:43.709 --> 41:46.085
We tried to poison you.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.797
We tried to poison you,

41:51.550 --> 41:55.720
because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth,

41:55.888 --> 41:57.889
and you deserve to die.

42:40.641 --> 42:42.725
Who's the bitch now?

43:03.163 --> 43:05.206
Let him bleed.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.810
The keys.

43:26.770 --> 43:28.396
Tuco.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.857
Oh, my God.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.319
The cousins?

44:31.210 --> 44:32.543
What the hell is going on?

44:44.306 --> 44:46.224
Jesse Pinkman.

44:46.934 --> 44:49.185
You're a hard man to find.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.612
Oh, shit.

45:10.916 --> 45:12.583
Easy.

46:29.369 --> 46:31.579
Oh, my God.

46:33.499 --> 46:36.709
Oh, God. Hank.

46:36.877 --> 46:38.336
Who?
Hank.

46:38.504 --> 46:39.921
What?

46:40.088 --> 46:41.839
Oh, my God.
What?

46:42.007 --> 46:45.218
Oh, my God.
Stay. What are you doing?
