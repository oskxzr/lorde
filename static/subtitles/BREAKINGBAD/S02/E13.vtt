02:52.506 --> 02:54.582
Come on.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.842
Come on.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.088
Come...

03:00.305 --> 03:03.140
Come on. Come on, baby.

03:03.809 --> 03:08.803
Please, please. Come on, come on.
Come on!

03:35.674 --> 03:39.339
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.160
Yeah.

04:12.294 --> 04:16.374
Slow down. Slow... Slow down.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.626
And just... Just take a deep breath.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.463
Do it.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.721
All right.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.466
Now, what happened?

04:39.279 --> 04:43.063
All right. All right. Now...

04:44.117 --> 04:48.411
...listen... Listen to me.
Are you listening?

04:49.248 --> 04:52.118
Everything is gonna be okay.
I promise.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.374
No, no... Listen. Calm down.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.080
Just...

04:56.964 --> 05:00.498
Sit tight. I know who to call.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.032
Saul Goodman sent me.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.419
Come on. Inside.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.640
Watch the door.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.472
Where is she?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.401
Any other drugs in the house?

07:32.953 --> 07:36.369
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.409
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

07:43.005 --> 07:44.499
Here's your story.

07:44.715 --> 07:48.249
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.344
Say it.

07:51.638 --> 07:55.932
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

07:59.313 --> 08:01.934
Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

08:02.149 --> 08:04.023
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

08:04.568 --> 08:05.564
Again.

08:06.445 --> 08:08.402
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.191
Again. Again.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.361
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.946
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.252
Once you call,
the people who show up...

08:24.463 --> 08:27.036
...will be with
the Office of Medical investigations.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.629
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.132
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.422
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.131
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.601
There's nothing to incriminate you...

08:39.811 --> 08:42.137
...so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

08:43.023 --> 08:47.768
However, if you do, you say nothing.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.109
You tell them
you just want your lawyer.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.528
Then you call Saul Goodman.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.155
And do I need to state the obvious?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.279
I was not here.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.128
You put on a long-sleeved shirt...

09:12.344 --> 09:14.253
...and cover
those track marks on your arm.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.594
Count down from 20,
and then you dial.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.407
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.142
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

10:06.356 --> 10:10.224
- Two.
- Two. All right.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.614
Thank you.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.076
Junior.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.286
Junior.

10:27.878 --> 10:30.285
- Flynn.
- What?

10:31.465 --> 10:32.924
Flynn.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.885
Flynn.

10:37.221 --> 10:39.593
I'll be there in a minute.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.436
You all right?

10:51.485 --> 10:54.818
Flynn, get your butt in here.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.858
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.068
Seriously.

11:03.914 --> 11:08.457
- What?
- Look right there. Look at that.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.084
Are those donations?

11:12.297 --> 11:13.957
- Yes.
- Actual donations for your dad?

11:17.010 --> 11:21.756
Total strangers gave us $490.

11:21.974 --> 11:26.801
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.472
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.061
And it's all real, actual money.

11:34.570 --> 11:38.402
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.487
And look what they're saying.

11:42.703 --> 11:46.997
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
"Hang in there."

11:48.000 --> 11:50.123
Isn't this awesome?

11:52.212 --> 11:56.625
That's... Wow, that is something.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.304
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

12:02.264 --> 12:05.597
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

12:05.809 --> 12:09.012
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

12:10.355 --> 12:15.563
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

12:15.777 --> 12:20.772
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.416
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

12:32.628 --> 12:33.623
"Do-not-call list."

12:33.837 --> 12:36.624
However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.462
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.716
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

12:41.929 --> 12:47.515
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

13:31.228 --> 13:34.846
Sir, you may not wanna
be here for this.

13:52.666 --> 13:58.751
I just woke up and I found her.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.791
That's all I know.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.299
What's her date of birth?

14:09.516 --> 14:13.134
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

14:14.104 --> 14:15.563
April...

14:15.772 --> 14:19.640
- April 4th, 1982.
- Okay.

14:20.110 --> 14:24.523
And mother's maiden name
and place of birth.

14:25.324 --> 14:28.075
- My mother?
- Your daughter's mother.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.905
Bishop.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.914
- And place of birth?
- Phoenix.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.873
Phoenix, Arizona?

14:43.717 --> 14:44.796
This is our address.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.260
Do you have someone
who can drive you?

14:47.471 --> 14:48.882
I can drive.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.055
Well, then if you'd like
to meet us there...

14:51.266 --> 14:53.674
...we can complete the intake
and take our samples...

14:53.894 --> 14:56.183
...and then you can make
your arrangements.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.725
Okay?

14:57.940 --> 15:01.474
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

15:25.592 --> 15:29.044
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this.

15:29.263 --> 15:31.255
- Forty from Te...
- Terre Haute.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.469
Walt.

15:42.985 --> 15:43.980
It's me.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.317
Are you there? Hello.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.781
I'm just checking in.

15:51.368 --> 15:55.318
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.864
That's... That's good.

15:58.083 --> 16:02.247
So listen. Just call me, all right?

16:02.462 --> 16:07.421
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.341
All right. I'm coming.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.767
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.932
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

16:21.148 --> 16:25.395
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.689
Biggest donation...

16:27.905 --> 16:30.740
...gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.449
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.487
Smallest donation
gets two six-packs.

16:35.704 --> 16:38.824
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down...

16:39.041 --> 16:40.072
...here's what we know.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.664
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.451
Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.297
"Combo?" I hear you say.

16:47.841 --> 16:51.459
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

16:51.678 --> 16:54.300
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

16:54.515 --> 16:57.052
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus...

16:57.267 --> 16:59.841
...from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

17:00.062 --> 17:04.012
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.066
So why am I talking about him?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.696
Anyone? Anyone?

17:09.905 --> 17:10.901
Bueller?

17:11.365 --> 17:13.322
- He was dealing Blue Sky.
- That's right.

17:13.534 --> 17:16.321
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade...

17:16.537 --> 17:21.163
...of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

17:21.375 --> 17:22.833
But wait. It gets better.

17:23.043 --> 17:26.163
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck...

17:26.380 --> 17:28.419
...the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

17:28.632 --> 17:31.549
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

17:32.636 --> 17:37.132
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.430
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.052
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

17:43.272 --> 17:48.977
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.187
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

17:51.405 --> 17:54.026
- He copped to it, didn't he?
- For an extra pudding cup...

17:54.241 --> 17:55.569
...every night at Los Lunas?

17:55.784 --> 17:57.860
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes...

17:58.078 --> 18:01.328
...he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.820
I've been thinking.

18:03.041 --> 18:07.538
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.664
Raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.551
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.128
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.505
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

18:19.725 --> 18:22.263
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff...

18:22.477 --> 18:25.478
...making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.

18:25.689 --> 18:29.817
In fact, everywhere but here.

18:30.360 --> 18:34.939
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.491
Now...

18:38.285 --> 18:40.906
...I say Heisenberg's still out there.

18:41.663 --> 18:44.071
I say he's gone regional.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.497
Only he's still right here in town.

18:47.628 --> 18:50.415
Come on, 2800.

18:50.631 --> 18:53.916
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.756
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.592
Fo... Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.266
- Yes!
- Yes!

19:06.063 --> 19:07.059
Who's gonna be next?

19:07.272 --> 19:09.064
Your guy found him?

19:09.566 --> 19:11.310
Where is he?

19:11.527 --> 19:12.522
Okay, listen.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.230
No, no, I don't care.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.071
You have your guy pick...

19:16.281 --> 19:18.274
Saul. Just shut... Saul.

19:18.492 --> 19:21.777
Saul, shut up
and give me the address.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.576
I don't recommend it.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.917
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place...

19:30.128 --> 19:32.798
...keep an eye
on the comings and goings.

19:33.507 --> 19:34.882
Are they here now?

19:35.092 --> 19:38.959
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.261
Police could be the least of it.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.431
You could just get mugged or shot.

19:46.812 --> 19:49.813
How about you go on home, Walter?

19:50.023 --> 19:52.016
Let me handle this.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.258
Yo.

21:22.491 --> 21:24.199
Jesse.

21:27.871 --> 21:30.279
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

21:30.499 --> 21:33.416
- Wake up. Wake up.
- Hey.

21:33.627 --> 21:37.292
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

21:37.506 --> 21:39.498
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just...

21:39.716 --> 21:42.967
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.293
Jesse.

21:44.513 --> 21:47.182
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

21:47.391 --> 21:51.009
No, no, no.

21:51.228 --> 21:53.221
- I'm good.
- Come on. Help me out now.

21:53.438 --> 21:56.772
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

21:56.984 --> 22:00.150
Listen, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.520
You are not good at all. You hear?

22:03.073 --> 22:06.407
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

22:06.618 --> 22:07.994
You're gonna stand up...

22:08.203 --> 22:10.659
...and we're gonna
walk out of here, okay?

22:10.873 --> 22:12.912
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

22:13.125 --> 22:16.375
That's it. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

22:44.323 --> 22:46.315
I killed her.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.570
- What?
- I killed her. It was me.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.411
- I killed her, man. I killed her.
- No.

22:51.622 --> 22:54.741
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.369
You didn't kill anybody.

22:57.753 --> 23:00.041
I loved her.

23:02.466 --> 23:06.380
I loved her more than anything.

23:15.979 --> 23:20.522
No, no. No.

24:09.575 --> 24:11.651
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

24:11.869 --> 24:14.075
I guess they should be...

24:15.247 --> 24:18.830
I don't know.
Just use your best judgment.

24:20.169 --> 24:22.457
There's no yellow dress here.

24:22.671 --> 24:26.289
It's all... It's all black and gray.

24:28.135 --> 24:30.970
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

24:32.764 --> 24:34.804
What about blue?

24:35.017 --> 24:38.302
Blue's better than black, right?

24:38.937 --> 24:42.140
No, no. Not dark blue. More like...

24:42.357 --> 24:46.355
Not super-bright, either.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.230
I mean, blue is blue.

24:48.447 --> 24:52.030
No. No cleavage.

24:53.410 --> 24:55.319
Long sleeves.

24:56.914 --> 24:59.784
Yeah. It's nice.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.037
It's nice.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.544
Big yawn, Holly.

25:10.761 --> 25:13.762
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

25:16.058 --> 25:18.845
- Okay, sweetie.
- Yes.

25:21.313 --> 25:22.772
Yes!

25:24.441 --> 25:25.437
Here we go.

25:25.651 --> 25:29.269
Here we go. Yes.

25:35.327 --> 25:38.696
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

25:39.248 --> 25:41.573
Junior. Hey.

25:42.626 --> 25:45.497
The dinging.
Just turn down the volume.

25:45.712 --> 25:50.339
- Dad, it's money.
- Just please do it.

25:50.551 --> 25:53.042
Okay, the noise
is disturbing the baby.

25:55.848 --> 25:57.840
Marie, slow down. I can't...

26:00.018 --> 26:03.019
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

26:03.522 --> 26:06.725
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

26:06.942 --> 26:10.726
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna... Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

26:10.946 --> 26:12.321
Okay.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.657
- Guess what.
- What?

26:15.868 --> 26:18.359
- You are gonna be in the newspaper.
- No way.

26:18.579 --> 26:20.571
One of Marie's patients
works at the Journal.

26:20.789 --> 26:23.078
She told him about the website
and the donations...

26:23.292 --> 26:25.617
...and they're gonna do a story
about you.

26:25.836 --> 26:26.832
- For real?
- Yep.

26:27.045 --> 26:30.046
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

26:30.257 --> 26:31.835
Awesome.

26:32.050 --> 26:36.629
- It'll mean more hits.
- And more contributions.

26:41.435 --> 26:43.344
East of Scottsdale?

26:43.562 --> 26:45.970
Let me guess. Not talking.

26:46.857 --> 26:48.648
Nope. Not a one.

26:48.859 --> 26:51.776
Someone somewhere
is running one tight ship.

26:54.114 --> 26:56.522
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

26:56.742 --> 26:58.485
Yeah. You too.

27:02.372 --> 27:04.164
Agent Schrader,
can you spare a moment?

27:04.374 --> 27:06.533
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

27:09.505 --> 27:12.375
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

27:12.883 --> 27:16.667
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

27:16.887 --> 27:18.630
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

27:18.847 --> 27:20.923
Paul Canterna
of Canterna Real Estate.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.968
- Hey, it's a pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

27:23.185 --> 27:26.684
And Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

27:26.897 --> 27:28.973
- Please, just Gus.
- Hi, Gus.

27:29.191 --> 27:30.982
You guys make some killer chicken.

27:31.777 --> 27:32.773
Thank you very much.

27:32.986 --> 27:35.477
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run...

27:35.697 --> 27:37.524
...and I thought
I would give them a tour.

27:37.741 --> 27:40.314
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

27:40.536 --> 27:42.612
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

27:42.829 --> 27:44.324
Yes, the Albuquerque office...

27:44.540 --> 27:47.161
...covers everything
from drug-related money laundering...

27:47.376 --> 27:50.127
...to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

27:50.712 --> 27:54.128
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine...

27:54.341 --> 27:57.342
...which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

27:57.553 --> 27:59.878
- Terrible.
- Yeah. It is indeed.

28:00.097 --> 28:01.674
We've had
some successes locally...

28:01.890 --> 28:03.966
...but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

28:04.184 --> 28:07.767
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run...

28:07.980 --> 28:10.138
...one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.555
Anything we can do.

28:11.775 --> 28:13.186
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Hank.

28:13.402 --> 28:14.516
- Gentlemen.
- Thanks.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.396
Sure. Thank you.

28:17.281 --> 28:19.072
Is this one of your agents?

28:19.283 --> 28:23.232
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.411
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to...

28:25.622 --> 28:29.038
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

28:30.085 --> 28:33.869
- Lung cancer.
- Oh, that's a rough one.

28:34.715 --> 28:39.840
- Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
- Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.

28:41.930 --> 28:43.638
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

29:02.451 --> 29:05.950
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.742
I'm gonna have
my surgery on Friday.

29:12.336 --> 29:14.743
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.752
But if not,
Saul will take care of things.

29:19.968 --> 29:23.172
He's got your money.
He's keeping it for you.

29:34.816 --> 29:38.814
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

29:39.029 --> 29:43.241
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay.

29:44.243 --> 29:46.282
I deserve this.

29:47.287 --> 29:48.746
What?

29:50.666 --> 29:53.620
What you said in the desert.

29:53.836 --> 29:57.536
I get it, what you meant.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.132
I deserve whatever happens.

30:24.533 --> 30:26.525
Oh, shit.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.710
There he is!

30:44.469 --> 30:47.589
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

30:47.806 --> 30:50.178
We called you about 50 times.

30:50.392 --> 30:53.761
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

30:53.979 --> 30:57.395
I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the Journal...

30:57.608 --> 31:01.142
...then why not TV? So I went for it.

31:02.529 --> 31:03.810
- This is him?
- Yes.

31:04.031 --> 31:05.406
This is Dad. Great.

31:05.616 --> 31:08.866
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...

31:09.077 --> 31:10.987
...Mom and Dad on either side.

31:11.205 --> 31:12.615
Mom and Dad?

31:14.666 --> 31:17.453
How much money
have you raised so far?

31:18.003 --> 31:21.704
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.963
But there's more coming in
all the time.

31:24.176 --> 31:27.011
- Wow, that's amazing.
- We don't even know what to say.

31:27.221 --> 31:30.672
It's just... It's been incredible.

31:30.891 --> 31:33.097
Judging from things you have
written about him...

31:33.310 --> 31:39.016
- ...your dad must be quite a guy.
- Yeah. He is. He's the best.

31:39.233 --> 31:41.688
You don't wanna lose him,
do you, Walter?

31:41.902 --> 31:46.065
None of us do. We love him.

31:46.698 --> 31:51.028
- He's a good man, isn't he?
- Absolutely. Ask anyone.

31:51.995 --> 31:55.115
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

31:55.332 --> 31:57.905
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

31:58.502 --> 32:02.416
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

32:02.631 --> 32:07.092
He's just decent.

32:07.302 --> 32:10.754
And he always does the right thing.

32:10.973 --> 32:14.424
And that's how he teaches me to be.

32:14.643 --> 32:19.435
- Would you say he's your hero?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

32:19.648 --> 32:22.269
My dad is my hero.

32:30.701 --> 32:32.325
Does that put him to sleep?

32:33.245 --> 32:34.988
This one just relaxes him a little.

32:35.205 --> 32:37.957
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.791
Okay. Thank you.

32:43.714 --> 32:44.959
Well...

32:46.758 --> 32:50.092
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

33:09.281 --> 33:12.198
Relaxed yet?

33:12.409 --> 33:14.532
As a matter of fact...

33:18.457 --> 33:23.285
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

33:25.297 --> 33:26.756
Yeah, it looks like it.

33:29.593 --> 33:31.669
We'll be here when you wake up.

33:32.638 --> 33:35.307
Well, I'll be looking for you.

33:35.516 --> 33:38.185
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

33:38.393 --> 33:40.101
Yeah, you better.

33:40.771 --> 33:44.638
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

33:46.235 --> 33:48.192
Where's your phone?

33:48.403 --> 33:50.610
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

33:50.822 --> 33:52.530
Which one?

33:56.036 --> 34:01.243
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

34:03.836 --> 34:05.211
Okay.

35:22.456 --> 35:23.915
Well, first things first.

35:24.124 --> 35:26.449
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

35:26.668 --> 35:29.622
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but...

35:29.838 --> 35:32.045
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

35:32.257 --> 35:33.253
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

35:33.467 --> 35:37.963
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...

35:38.180 --> 35:40.007
...here somewhere.

35:41.558 --> 35:43.847
- She's beautiful.
- Thanks.

35:44.061 --> 35:46.766
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

35:48.190 --> 35:51.773
- How's your pain level, Walter?
- It's...

35:51.985 --> 35:53.978
Very low, basically.

35:54.196 --> 35:56.070
Shortness of breath?

35:56.281 --> 35:59.033
- A bit, but much better.
- Good.

36:00.202 --> 36:01.945
Well, your margins look good.

36:02.162 --> 36:03.656
I can't foresee the future...

36:03.872 --> 36:05.664
...but even
conservatively speaking...

36:05.874 --> 36:08.496
...I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

36:09.670 --> 36:12.077
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

36:12.297 --> 36:14.089
That's great.

36:14.550 --> 36:17.883
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

36:19.263 --> 36:22.679
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

36:22.891 --> 36:25.216
- He can ease into it now.
- Okay.

36:25.435 --> 36:30.856
- And can he go back to work or...?
- I'd give it a few more weeks.

36:31.400 --> 36:35.232
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

36:35.445 --> 36:38.019
But he can be on his own?

36:38.240 --> 36:41.490
I mean, just more,
you know, independent.

36:41.952 --> 36:44.490
Yes. Use your best judgment.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.611
Well...

36:46.832 --> 36:49.405
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

36:49.626 --> 36:51.915
One less baby in the house.

37:03.307 --> 37:05.465
- Don, hey.
- Hey, Stew.

37:05.684 --> 37:08.140
Hey, welcome back.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.311
Thanks. It's good to be back.

37:12.441 --> 37:16.901
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

37:17.696 --> 37:19.854
Yes. Thanks.

37:20.199 --> 37:22.275
Terrible thing. Just...

37:23.035 --> 37:26.201
But, you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and...

37:26.413 --> 37:29.082
- You been doing okay?
- I'm doing okay.

37:29.499 --> 37:32.999
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help...

37:33.212 --> 37:36.746
...so I figured I'd rather be here.

37:37.299 --> 37:41.249
- Focus on work.
- Sure. Absolutely.

37:41.887 --> 37:43.215
Yeah.

37:43.805 --> 37:46.213
Well, see you inside.

37:47.768 --> 37:51.219
Continue to descend through 1500.

37:51.438 --> 37:54.439
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

37:54.650 --> 37:58.398
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

37:58.612 --> 38:02.360
Truth or Consequences altimeter,
two-niner-niner-eight.

38:02.574 --> 38:07.450
Pima 311, contact
Albuquerque Center 134.6.

38:07.663 --> 38:11.162
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

38:11.834 --> 38:15.997
Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Winslow.

38:16.213 --> 38:18.786
I think I may just keep this.

38:19.049 --> 38:20.080
Sky?

38:21.760 --> 38:23.254
What do you think?

38:25.097 --> 38:27.136
Doesn't look so bad, right?

38:29.434 --> 38:30.633
What are you doing?

38:30.853 --> 38:33.390
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

38:35.607 --> 38:37.481
- Since when?
- I'm taking the baby with me.

38:37.693 --> 38:39.602
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

38:40.362 --> 38:43.233
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

38:43.866 --> 38:46.403
I want you to pack your things
and leave.

38:47.369 --> 38:48.614
Why would I do that?

38:48.829 --> 38:51.996
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
be doing any heavy lifting.

38:52.207 --> 38:54.663
- Skyler.
- I want you gone by Monday morning.

38:54.877 --> 38:56.287
I want...

38:56.712 --> 38:57.910
I want you gone.

39:07.723 --> 39:11.637
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

39:12.644 --> 39:14.970
Because you're a liar, Walt.

39:17.149 --> 39:18.809
Two cell phones, after all.

39:20.277 --> 39:21.273
What?

39:21.486 --> 39:24.440
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone...

39:24.656 --> 39:28.524
...and you said, "Which one?"

39:29.786 --> 39:30.985
When?

39:31.205 --> 39:33.742
Skyler, I was medicated.

39:33.957 --> 39:36.116
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

39:36.335 --> 39:37.330
You know what I think?

39:39.254 --> 39:42.421
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

39:42.799 --> 39:45.504
Honey, we have been over this.

39:45.719 --> 39:47.676
Asked and answered, right?

39:47.888 --> 39:50.805
Then it got me thinking again...

39:51.016 --> 39:54.599
...about all the strange behaviour.

39:54.811 --> 39:57.267
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

39:57.481 --> 39:59.936
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals...

40:00.150 --> 40:02.059
...checking the morgue.

40:02.903 --> 40:05.061
Your fugue state?

40:07.658 --> 40:10.231
I had to believe that, didn't I?

40:10.744 --> 40:13.200
I had to find a way.

40:14.164 --> 40:19.075
I mean, who would lie
about such a thing?

40:19.795 --> 40:21.075
You tell me, Skyler.

40:21.296 --> 40:24.381
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

40:24.883 --> 40:27.754
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

40:27.970 --> 40:30.176
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

40:30.389 --> 40:33.058
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

40:33.267 --> 40:35.639
Well, my guess
was Gretchen Schwartz.

40:36.436 --> 40:40.185
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

40:40.399 --> 40:43.934
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

40:44.152 --> 40:45.944
I am not having an affair
with Gretchen.

40:46.154 --> 40:49.191
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

40:52.995 --> 40:55.283
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

40:55.497 --> 40:57.406
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

40:58.375 --> 40:59.786
So I finally left a message:

41:00.002 --> 41:03.834
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

41:04.047 --> 41:06.455
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

41:06.675 --> 41:10.258
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

41:11.763 --> 41:14.136
The money for your treatment...

41:15.434 --> 41:19.348
...Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

41:21.023 --> 41:22.766
They paid for nothing.

41:22.983 --> 41:25.391
You refused every offer
they made you.

41:25.611 --> 41:26.891
But that didn't make sense...

41:27.112 --> 41:29.568
...because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital...

41:29.781 --> 41:33.067
...and not including your surgery...

41:33.285 --> 41:35.278
...we're nearly paid up.

41:35.621 --> 41:38.325
Over $100,000.

41:39.791 --> 41:44.169
Out of where? Out of thin air?

41:52.638 --> 41:54.381
But then...

41:55.849 --> 41:58.056
...I called your mother.

42:00.145 --> 42:01.687
Yeah.

42:02.731 --> 42:04.558
Thanks for that too.

42:05.234 --> 42:07.559
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money...

42:07.778 --> 42:11.858
...that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

42:13.242 --> 42:15.115
It's possible.

42:17.287 --> 42:21.748
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother...

42:21.959 --> 42:27.000
...she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

42:30.259 --> 42:32.547
You never went to see her.

42:34.221 --> 42:36.297
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

42:36.515 --> 42:37.926
You were gone for four days...

42:38.141 --> 42:41.925
...and yet she swears...

42:42.479 --> 42:44.768
...that you were never there.

42:49.528 --> 42:53.857
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

42:55.784 --> 42:56.780
Skyler.

42:57.870 --> 42:59.661
Could you...

43:00.622 --> 43:02.579
...just once...

43:05.460 --> 43:09.161
...do me the courtesy
of not denying it?

43:18.348 --> 43:19.926
Skyler.

43:21.602 --> 43:23.262
Skyler, don't do this, please.

43:23.478 --> 43:25.720
I...

43:26.315 --> 43:28.853
Skyler, please don't go.

43:37.701 --> 43:42.410
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

43:44.499 --> 43:47.335
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

43:48.670 --> 43:50.497
Whatever it is...

43:51.632 --> 43:53.589
...I'm afraid to know.

44:21.870 --> 44:24.077
Wayfarer-515, radio check.

44:25.165 --> 44:27.205
