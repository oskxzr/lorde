- What's up?
- How's it going?

00:41.250 --> 00:42.245
All right.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.693
What you need?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.278
You buying
or you just stopping to envy?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.035
Yeah. Punk bitches.

02:02.497 --> 02:07.919
Please leave your message
for 505-127-5223.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.082
Record your message after the tone.
To send a numeric page...

02:11.298 --> 02:12.413
Bounce, little man.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.132
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.587
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.094
Get your ass up here now.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.895
- What's that thing in your ear?
- What did I say? Get out of here!

02:28.941 --> 02:31.099
What are you waiting for? Go!

03:37.217 --> 03:40.669
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments...

03:40.888 --> 03:44.091
...that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.553
Absolutely.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.143
As you know...

03:47.352 --> 03:50.353
...my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.315
That may no longer be the case.

03:54.526 --> 03:59.022
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.031
Maybe a pretty good option.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.911
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country...

04:04.119 --> 04:06.693
...performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.239
He's got a good track record.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.035
Pretty good.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.791
It sounds...

04:15.088 --> 04:16.203
...aggressive.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.543
Yes. Very much so.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.546
Understand that
if you don't have this surgery...

04:21.762 --> 04:24.051
...you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.387
And it will.

04:27.226 --> 04:30.262
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.563
Maybe a lot, probably a little...

04:34.441 --> 04:36.232
...but that's all.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.234
In my opinion...

04:38.445 --> 04:40.734
...if you're willing to take some risk...

04:40.948 --> 04:43.071
...then this offers the best chance.

04:49.623 --> 04:53.668
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.664
I'd say between 170-...

04:56.880 --> 04:59.288
...and 200,000, all in.

04:59.508 --> 05:03.091
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can...

05:03.303 --> 05:06.090
...but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

05:08.183 --> 05:11.766
This is obviously a big decision...

05:11.979 --> 05:15.264
...and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.692
No.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.151
I'll do it.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.111
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

05:31.456 --> 05:34.410
I just think it's the way to go.

05:37.379 --> 05:41.792
I have to say,
I think it's the right choice.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.090
I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal...

05:45.304 --> 05:47.095
...for another couple of weeks...

05:47.306 --> 05:49.594
...and then we'll have at it.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.057
That's tricky.

05:55.856 --> 05:59.307
- When's the due date?
- It's the 21st.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.855
So two weeks and change?

06:01.069 --> 06:03.276
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.608
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

06:06.825 --> 06:10.159
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.158
Yeah.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.845
Fourteen messages...

06:33.060 --> 06:34.933
God.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.476
- Yeah.
- It's me.

06:39.691 --> 06:43.107
Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.695
Working.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.233
What is it?

06:49.368 --> 06:50.992
Combo's dead.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.198
Shot.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.030
Which one is he?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.870
You did not just say that to me.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.541
- Jesse, listen...
- That figures.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.845
What's the word on the street?

07:16.645 --> 07:18.685
No one's dropping no names.

07:18.897 --> 07:22.064
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him...

07:22.276 --> 07:26.060
...trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

07:27.114 --> 07:31.574
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean...

07:31.785 --> 07:33.576
...what'd you expect?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.117
I don't know.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.991
You don't know?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.036
Is that all you got?

07:42.296 --> 07:45.083
I'll do right by Combo's people.

07:46.925 --> 07:51.552
But make sure you bust up your cell
and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.429
I appreciate what
you're saying and all...

07:56.643 --> 08:01.056
...but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

08:02.065 --> 08:03.524
I'm on probation, man.

08:03.734 --> 08:06.604
Fast track to Los Lunas.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.195
We're on the verge...

08:10.407 --> 08:14.619
...of making some serious coin,
Skinny.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.284
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

08:19.124 --> 08:23.122
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.084
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge...

08:26.298 --> 08:29.169
...maybe we were doing okay,
but that whole...

08:29.718 --> 08:32.672
- ...thing to the head thing, the ATM?
- Yeah?

08:32.888 --> 08:34.631
His junkie bitch copped to it.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.804
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.309
Everyone knows?

08:46.485 --> 08:50.150
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know, man.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.822
Because we like you and all.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.152
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.316
We'll get by.

08:57.538 --> 09:01.322
- All right? We'll make it.
- Sorry, Jesse.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.668
I'm out.

09:12.886 --> 09:17.548
We have had a bit of a setback.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.760
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

09:21.979 --> 09:24.766
- How about "your fault"?
- No, no, don't lay that on me.

09:24.982 --> 09:28.148
- You are in charge of distribution.
- You said expand the territory.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.768
- Doesn't mean you become careless.
- Guys, guys! Hey!

09:30.988 --> 09:33.858
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counselor.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.695
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.950
Now, setback. Go.

09:39.913 --> 09:43.247
One of our dealers was murdered.

09:44.251 --> 09:48.379
It was some kind of turf dispute...

09:48.589 --> 09:50.712
...and apparently we lost.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.633
And then everyone quit on us.

09:52.843 --> 09:56.710
I mean,
we have absolutely no distribution.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.386
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.639
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.390
Well, there's your silver lining.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.394
How about you?
How's the health situation?

10:09.610 --> 10:12.895
It's better. Do you mind?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.572
Better?

10:16.074 --> 10:17.948
Yeah, it's...

10:19.995 --> 10:24.206
...looking a little more positive.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.159
I may have more time than I thought.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.203
Outstanding.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.709
Now, as to your dead guy:

10:30.923 --> 10:32.714
occupational hazard.

10:32.925 --> 10:34.170
Drug dealer getting shot?

10:34.384 --> 10:38.429
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.723
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

10:44.102 --> 10:46.095
Thirty-eight and change.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.187
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

10:48.398 --> 10:49.596
Pounds.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.059
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.356
Guys!

10:57.574 --> 10:59.448
Why the long faces here?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.783
You're sitting on a gold mine.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.071
A gold mine we can't sell.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.578
We need a proper infrastructure.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.117
We need foot soldiers
and we need dealers...

11:09.336 --> 11:11.163
...on a street level
that are rock solid.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.464
We need muscle
and we need enforcers.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.632
Payback. That's what we need.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.307
God.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.434
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

11:32.109 --> 11:35.478
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.189
We need your help.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.488
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

11:42.703 --> 11:44.363
Ready for this? Here goes.

11:44.580 --> 11:48.494
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.164
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.786
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

11:54.006 --> 11:58.418
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.842
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.676
What, some tattooed speed freak?

12:03.891 --> 12:07.306
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.311
Somebody who treats your product...

12:09.521 --> 12:12.890
...like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

12:13.108 --> 12:16.311
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

12:16.528 --> 12:20.858
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.695
You know someone like that?

12:24.912 --> 12:28.861
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.956
Who knows another guy.

12:31.168 --> 12:35.000
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.041
Well, what's his name?

12:40.385 --> 12:41.844
I have no idea.

12:42.721 --> 12:46.505
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.843
You know,
from what I do hear about him...

12:50.062 --> 12:52.054
...he sounds a little like you.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.862
And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.

13:00.072 --> 13:02.645
He's coming to the end
and he's got the big fist pump.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.903
Now Mueller's coming.
Oh, a double! Here he comes.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.654
And he's coming to the end
and he takes second.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.913
I need you to leave.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.882
Look, there's...

13:23.887 --> 13:26.972
...some stuff about me
you don't know and...

13:31.019 --> 13:32.514
Like you're a drug dealer?

13:34.314 --> 13:35.856
I kind of got that.

13:37.276 --> 13:41.190
You pay in cash
and you use an alias, so...

13:47.494 --> 13:49.950
One of my guys...

13:50.706 --> 13:53.541
...a friend who worked for me...

13:54.668 --> 13:55.913
...got murdered.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.038
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

14:01.967 --> 14:05.965
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go...

14:06.180 --> 14:10.224
...being that you're in a program
and all and...

14:13.395 --> 14:15.269
You could come with me
to a meeting.

14:17.316 --> 14:18.893
No.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.611
No meetings.

14:22.362 --> 14:26.063
We could just get out of here.

14:28.452 --> 14:32.746
- It won't help.
- Yeah, it will.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.412
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.168
I just...

14:37.377 --> 14:41.126
All right, I really just need you to go.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.739
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.529
Thank you.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.477
You're late.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.267
Yeah.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.276
We're in the big time now.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.198
So where's the kingpin?

16:34.995 --> 16:37.616
Your guess is as good as mine.

16:41.210 --> 16:43.783
So you get the dude's name?

16:44.171 --> 16:45.630
Nope.

16:45.839 --> 16:49.089
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names...

16:49.301 --> 16:52.385
...what we look like,
but not the other way around?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.971
Why don't you get yourself
some food?

16:58.185 --> 17:00.427
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals...

17:00.646 --> 17:02.306
...looking like a couple chumps?

17:02.523 --> 17:05.310
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

17:05.817 --> 17:07.062
Fine, thanks.

17:09.321 --> 17:12.275
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

17:12.950 --> 17:14.574
I don't get you, man.

17:14.785 --> 17:18.569
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

17:19.790 --> 17:23.123
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.078
Yeah, what about after?

17:25.295 --> 17:28.664
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

17:28.882 --> 17:31.338
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

17:31.552 --> 17:33.675
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

17:34.221 --> 17:37.471
- Things have changed.
- Oh, I know.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.100
We got a guy killed.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.432
You know what?

17:46.900 --> 17:48.145
This is bullshit.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.192
- I'm out of here.
- Hey.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.201
I think she's waking up from a nap.

18:04.418 --> 18:07.834
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.044
We have to keep an eye
on your fluids.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.921
You're on the low side of normal.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.711
What? How low?

18:18.932 --> 18:22.052
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.768
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

18:27.316 --> 18:28.726
Hey.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.065
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.235
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

18:33.447 --> 18:35.439
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hi.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.065
- What did I miss?
- For your refrigerator.

18:38.994 --> 18:40.369
Oh, my God.

18:40.579 --> 18:41.777
Look at her.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.408
- Look.
- Yeah.

18:43.624 --> 18:46.245
God. It's like she's here already.

18:46.460 --> 18:50.043
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.462
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.584
It's time to make a decision.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.921
- You know what I'm gonna say.
- The C-section?

18:58.138 --> 19:00.380
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

19:00.599 --> 19:06.518
Well, my last labor
was pretty tough, so...

19:06.980 --> 19:09.650
For the baby, I say yes.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.610
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

19:12.819 --> 19:17.113
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for...

19:17.324 --> 19:18.783
...a week from Friday?

19:21.662 --> 19:23.453
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

19:28.168 --> 19:29.995
We have a birthday.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.046
The 16th.

19:32.256 --> 19:34.379
- I like it.
- Yeah.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.876
You know, speaking of birthdays...

19:38.095 --> 19:41.630
...I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

19:41.849 --> 19:44.636
It's an hour before closing.

19:44.852 --> 19:46.891
You're supposed to be
taking it easy.

19:47.104 --> 19:49.310
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday...

19:49.523 --> 19:51.147
...and I've gotta pick up the cake.

19:51.650 --> 19:52.895
Why you?

19:53.861 --> 19:57.609
Because I said I would...?

19:57.823 --> 20:00.396
It is the least I can do.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.532
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.121
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.712
Let's get out of here.

20:55.923 --> 20:58.129
You know, go do something.

20:59.635 --> 21:01.426
Seriously.

21:01.762 --> 21:05.047
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

21:05.641 --> 21:07.598
Let's take a drive.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.224
Sure.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.704
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.829
We're halfway through the job.

21:37.422 --> 21:41.919
Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
Mr. Beneke to the shop.

21:42.761 --> 21:45.715
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

21:45.931 --> 21:47.176
I gotta go.

21:47.391 --> 21:49.383
Dean, I gotta go.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.760
Okay, all right.

21:54.773 --> 21:57.608
Happy birthday!

21:58.485 --> 21:59.766
Happy birthday!

21:59.987 --> 22:03.190
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

22:03.407 --> 22:06.112
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

22:06.952 --> 22:09.953
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

22:10.163 --> 22:14.031
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

22:14.251 --> 22:17.454
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.294
- Wait. Skyler?
- Yes?

22:22.509 --> 22:24.087
I wanna hear it first.

22:25.012 --> 22:26.554
Absolutely not. No way.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.005
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

22:29.224 --> 22:31.976
- Yes, I can. Watch me.
- Please!

22:32.186 --> 22:35.970
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

22:36.190 --> 22:39.641
- Come on. It was so good last time.
- It was ages ago.

22:39.860 --> 22:42.730
And I'm enormous now.

22:42.946 --> 22:45.153
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.654
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

22:47.868 --> 22:50.275
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.239
- Seriously.
- Yes, come on, Skyler.

22:52.456 --> 22:57.165
- Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...
- It's obscene.

22:57.377 --> 23:00.331
Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...

23:10.641 --> 23:16.015
Happy birthday to you

23:17.397 --> 23:22.854
Happy birthday to you

23:24.404 --> 23:30.609
Happy birthday, Mr. President

23:30.827 --> 23:35.121
Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated

23:36.750 --> 23:39.704
Happy birthday

23:41.255 --> 23:44.374
To you

23:48.387 --> 23:50.047
That was fantastic.

23:50.264 --> 23:52.090
Isn't she great, huh?

23:52.850 --> 23:54.676
Okay, here we go.

24:06.697 --> 24:09.401
- He wasn't there.
- Oh, he was there, all right.

24:09.616 --> 24:12.154
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

24:12.369 --> 24:13.484
Nobody came.

24:13.704 --> 24:16.325
All I know is my contact
said he was there.

24:16.540 --> 24:18.782
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

24:19.001 --> 24:20.827
Yes, I'm positive.

24:21.044 --> 24:22.539
- Where was he?
- Who knows?

24:22.754 --> 24:25.424
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens...

24:25.632 --> 24:27.424
...didn't like the cut of your jib.

24:27.634 --> 24:32.012
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

24:33.015 --> 24:34.675
What? What do you mean?

24:34.892 --> 24:36.267
No deal. No dice.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.434
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

24:38.896 --> 24:39.891
Wait a minute.

24:40.105 --> 24:42.596
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

24:42.816 --> 24:45.936
I told you, he's very cautious
who he does business with, all right?

24:46.778 --> 24:50.610
He's skittish, like a deer.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.868
Call him back.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.117
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.951
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.408
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

25:01.627 --> 25:03.868
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.747
Second of all, it's over.

25:05.964 --> 25:08.420
Understand?
With this particular individual...

25:08.634 --> 25:11.006
...all you get is the one shot.

25:12.262 --> 25:13.460
Look...

25:13.680 --> 25:16.302
...I'll see if I can scrape
something else together...

25:16.517 --> 25:18.260
...but don't get your hopes up.

25:18.477 --> 25:21.229
No one else handles
that kind of bulk.

25:21.438 --> 25:22.980
Damn it.

27:03.457 --> 27:06.493
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.586
Can I help you, sir?

27:17.471 --> 27:19.713
Diet Coke, please.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.679
And five minutes of your time.

27:35.239 --> 27:37.943
- What can I do for you?
- Have a seat.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.285
Please.

27:52.798 --> 27:57.009
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

27:58.387 --> 28:01.092
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

28:02.140 --> 28:05.841
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

28:06.603 --> 28:09.059
I believe that person was you.

28:09.523 --> 28:12.808
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.563
I don't think I am.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.527
Sir, if you have a complaint...

28:21.743 --> 28:23.985
...I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

28:24.204 --> 28:26.660
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

28:28.208 --> 28:31.126
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with...

28:31.336 --> 28:33.625
...is very careful.

28:33.839 --> 28:35.831
A cautious man.

28:37.009 --> 28:39.547
I believe we're alike in that way.

28:41.638 --> 28:45.303
If you are who I think you are...

28:45.851 --> 28:47.927
...you should give me another chance.

28:53.025 --> 28:55.860
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

28:57.696 --> 29:00.483
You are not a cautious man at all.

29:00.699 --> 29:03.700
Your partner was late
and he was high.

29:04.870 --> 29:07.622
Yes. Yes, he was.

29:08.415 --> 29:11.618
He's high often, isn't he?

29:15.214 --> 29:17.005
You have poor judgment.

29:18.425 --> 29:20.465
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

29:20.677 --> 29:23.797
Are you familiar with my product?

29:24.431 --> 29:28.014
- I've been told it's excellent.
- It is impeccable.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.680
It is the purest...

29:30.896 --> 29:34.347
...most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

29:34.566 --> 29:36.891
That is not the only factor.

29:37.110 --> 29:41.060
You could charge twice the current rate
for what I provide...

29:41.281 --> 29:43.737
...and your customers would pay it.

29:44.284 --> 29:46.028
Hands down.

29:46.787 --> 29:53.205
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

29:54.127 --> 29:55.408
You won't see him.

29:55.629 --> 29:58.381
You won't interact with him.

29:58.966 --> 30:00.590
Forget he exists.

30:02.052 --> 30:04.424
I have to ask.

30:06.181 --> 30:07.260
Why?

30:07.474 --> 30:09.266
Why him?

30:11.645 --> 30:14.480
Because he does what I say.

30:15.941 --> 30:18.349
Because I can trust him.

30:20.070 --> 30:22.110
How much product
do you have on hand?

30:22.906 --> 30:24.780
Thirty-eight pounds.

30:24.992 --> 30:27.613
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

30:33.876 --> 30:35.702
Will I hear from you?

30:38.380 --> 30:39.755
I have your numbers.

30:43.969 --> 30:47.919
You can never trust a drug addict.

31:03.030 --> 31:05.651
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs...

31:05.866 --> 31:09.033
...but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

31:09.244 --> 31:12.779
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

31:12.998 --> 31:14.540
Dribs and drabs.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.826
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller...

31:17.044 --> 31:20.495
...the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

31:20.714 --> 31:25.791
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

31:28.722 --> 31:32.471
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

31:32.684 --> 31:35.685
I found six other instances...

31:36.855 --> 31:39.393
...of revenues being under-reported.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.105
And I've only just started
to look into it.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.689
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

31:46.907 --> 31:49.149
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

31:49.368 --> 31:51.241
Most of the time, they overestimate.

31:51.453 --> 31:53.861
I let them roll their overages
into the next order...

31:54.081 --> 31:56.204
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.041
Obviously, we forgot...

31:58.252 --> 32:02.249
...or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

32:02.464 --> 32:05.714
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see...

32:05.926 --> 32:09.544
...the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

32:10.639 --> 32:12.014
Right.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.808
Right...

32:14.017 --> 32:18.644
...but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage...

32:18.856 --> 32:21.228
...to try and sort this out.

32:22.359 --> 32:26.404
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

32:27.823 --> 32:29.899
In a few cases...

32:31.326 --> 32:34.576
...I found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

32:37.624 --> 32:39.332
Ted.

32:49.511 --> 32:51.136
All right.

32:52.890 --> 32:54.514
You got me.

32:55.058 --> 32:59.934
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

33:00.397 --> 33:03.517
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking...

33:03.734 --> 33:05.892
...about saving a company.

33:06.111 --> 33:07.902
I'm thinking about people's jobs...

33:08.113 --> 33:09.904
...about their mortgages
and pensions...

33:10.115 --> 33:13.401
...and their college funds
for their kids.

33:14.244 --> 33:15.442
Not to mention my own.

33:15.662 --> 33:18.236
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

33:18.457 --> 33:20.117
Yes, it does, Skyler.

33:20.334 --> 33:22.243
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

33:22.461 --> 33:25.746
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

33:25.964 --> 33:27.423
- If I don't keep up...
- Ted.

33:27.633 --> 33:30.468
People go to prison for this.

33:36.475 --> 33:39.559
My dad built this company
from nothing.

33:40.437 --> 33:42.893
We make things here.

33:43.106 --> 33:46.143
The people who work here
are like family.

33:46.693 --> 33:50.442
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

33:55.077 --> 33:56.108
Sky...

33:58.914 --> 34:00.907
...don't report this.

34:01.917 --> 34:03.495
Please.

34:05.754 --> 34:08.375
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

34:13.220 --> 34:15.675
But I can't be a part of it.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.220
I know.

34:20.853 --> 34:23.094
I know. I just wish...

34:24.231 --> 34:25.939
I'm sorry.

34:28.068 --> 34:29.895
I don't want you to go.

34:47.629 --> 34:50.714
Yo, if I know you, leave a message.

34:50.924 --> 34:53.676
Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.

34:53.886 --> 34:55.712
We missed you at the funeral today.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.388
The whole crew was representing.

34:57.598 --> 34:59.555
Even Badger came
all the way from Fresno.

34:59.766 --> 35:01.842
Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins...

35:02.060 --> 35:04.018
...everyone was all choked up
and shit.

35:04.229 --> 35:06.899
Man, it was, like, emotional.

35:07.107 --> 35:09.064
And you should have
seen the coffin.

35:09.276 --> 35:11.150
It was this shiny white pearlescent.

35:11.361 --> 35:14.446
I'm sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.

35:14.656 --> 35:17.610
So we're definitely talking high-end.

35:17.826 --> 35:21.029
Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.

35:21.246 --> 35:24.331
Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.

36:06.834 --> 36:08.791
I like to mix some ice with it.

36:57.342 --> 36:59.002
Hold that.

37:01.388 --> 37:02.847
What's it feel like?

37:06.518 --> 37:08.310
There's a chill.

37:09.521 --> 37:11.763
Don't freak out. It passes.

37:12.232 --> 37:13.513
And then...

37:13.734 --> 37:14.848
You'll see.

37:19.615 --> 37:21.275
I'll meet you there.

37:33.045 --> 37:34.669
Take that off.

40:04.196 --> 40:06.651
Phones off, please.

40:24.758 --> 40:26.798
Pipes, I guess.

40:27.010 --> 40:29.798
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

40:30.389 --> 40:32.465
Eyes on your paper.

40:47.573 --> 40:48.901
Yes.

41:03.297 --> 41:04.791
Excuse me, where's the manager?

41:05.007 --> 41:07.295
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

41:07.509 --> 41:10.925
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

41:11.138 --> 41:14.008
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

41:14.224 --> 41:15.766
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

41:15.976 --> 41:17.803
Oh, owner. Okay.

41:18.020 --> 41:20.771
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

41:20.981 --> 41:23.270
He could be at any one of them.

41:24.443 --> 41:28.026
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

41:28.238 --> 41:30.943
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

41:31.158 --> 41:34.242
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

41:34.453 --> 41:36.280
No, no.

41:36.496 --> 41:38.454
- What's his name?
- Gustavo.

41:38.665 --> 41:40.160
Gus.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.371
Thank you.

41:45.672 --> 41:48.080
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

41:48.300 --> 41:51.751
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

41:51.970 --> 41:53.299
- One hour.
- What?

41:53.514 --> 41:54.889
One hour. You in or out?

41:55.516 --> 41:58.682
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

41:58.894 --> 42:00.887
One hour. If you miss it...

42:01.104 --> 42:03.809
...don't ever show your face
in here again.

42:09.780 --> 42:12.650
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck...

42:12.866 --> 42:15.986
- Come on! Come on!
- Yo, if I know you, leave a message.

42:16.203 --> 42:18.990
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

42:19.206 --> 42:21.033
Pick up the phone.

42:21.708 --> 42:24.579
I'm coming by. I need the product.

42:24.795 --> 42:26.586
I need the product now.

43:14.011 --> 43:16.466
Oh, God.

43:28.025 --> 43:29.400
Jesse.

43:32.821 --> 43:34.446
Jesse!

43:35.073 --> 43:36.698
Jesse.

43:37.534 --> 43:39.242
Jesse.

43:59.139 --> 44:01.844
Jesse. Jesse.

44:03.018 --> 44:04.809
Jesse.

44:26.625 --> 44:28.783
Jesse.

44:29.002 --> 44:30.580
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

44:30.796 --> 44:32.456
Jesse.

44:33.215 --> 44:35.788
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

44:36.009 --> 44:37.124
Wake up!

44:37.344 --> 44:38.922
Come on, damn it.

44:39.137 --> 44:40.418
Wake up.

44:41.807 --> 44:42.803
Where'd you put it?

44:43.016 --> 44:44.760
- Where's the product?
- Get off of me.

44:44.977 --> 44:47.847
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

44:48.063 --> 44:49.806
- In the kitchen.
- Where?

44:50.649 --> 44:52.642
Under the sink.

45:55.088 --> 46:00.047
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!
