00:12.262 --> 00:14.219
Okay. That's okay.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.819
Get that.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.358
Hey.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.521
- Oh, God. Please.
- Oh, jeez.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.145
Please.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.641
Please.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.829
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.830
You sure this is the way to go?

02:05.042 --> 02:06.287
Yeah.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.830
Yeah.

03:30.836 --> 03:31.915
You see that?

04:02.409 --> 04:05.078
- What does he remember?
- Not a whole lot.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.114
He came in dehydrated
and disoriented...

04:07.331 --> 04:10.035
...but once we gave him fluids
he stabilized pretty quickly.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.365
But I mean...

04:11.585 --> 04:14.954
- He knows where he is?
- Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.505
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

04:18.717 --> 04:21.290
Go on in. He's probably awake.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.970
My God.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.227
Walter.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.065
I'm so sorry.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.981
Come here.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.490
You know who I am, right?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.829
Yes, son. I know who you are.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.874
Come here. Give your old man a hug.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.994
It's so good to see you.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.084
How do you feel?

05:06.557 --> 05:07.802
Better.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.843
Yeah. I...

05:10.060 --> 05:12.302
I feel like myself.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.513
Really, I mean, in...

05:16.149 --> 05:19.815
The past couple days are missing,
but other than that...

05:20.028 --> 05:21.060
...I feel fine.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.272
My God, Walt.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.859
What a day this has been.

05:28.078 --> 05:31.198
So, Uncle Hank,
he was in a shootout?

05:32.207 --> 05:33.536
A shootout?

05:33.750 --> 05:36.704
He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.916
Uncle Hank wasted him.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.799
- Oh, my God. Is he all right?
- Absolutely fine.

05:41.008 --> 05:44.792
- Where did this happen? How could...?
- Walt, everything's okay.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.427
We're all okay.

05:49.308 --> 05:50.303
We'll be all right.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.139
And no idea what caused it?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.551
No.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.725
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so...

05:57.941 --> 06:01.891
But what could it be? I mean, did they
give you a worst-case scenario?

06:02.613 --> 06:04.237
I really...

06:05.949 --> 06:08.986
You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so...

06:09.203 --> 06:10.697
Well, which supermarket?

06:10.913 --> 06:13.949
Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

06:14.166 --> 06:16.871
- Marie.
- I... Don't get me wrong.

06:17.085 --> 06:22.080
I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.090
I just, I mean...

06:25.761 --> 06:27.919
He... Naked?

06:28.138 --> 06:30.925
He was naked.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.885
Naked.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.679
In a supermarket.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.270
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

06:37.314 --> 06:39.805
In any case, I'm gonna get over there
as soon as I can.

06:40.025 --> 06:43.061
No, no. Don't worry about it
right now, Marie.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.689
How's Hank?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.443
You know, I ran over here
and I got to see him all of...

06:47.658 --> 06:50.943
...30 seconds
before they yanked him away.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.996
You know, you'd think today
of all days...

06:54.206 --> 06:57.326
...they'd let him go home on time.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.745
But how is he? Really?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.454
Hank?

07:07.219 --> 07:09.840
He's indestructible, you know that.

07:10.848 --> 07:15.426
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.313
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...

07:18.522 --> 07:21.807
...and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

07:22.025 --> 07:25.608
- He was shot previous to your arrival?
- Yes, sir.

07:25.821 --> 07:29.439
Again I instructed him
to show his hands.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.816
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle...

07:32.035 --> 07:35.570
...and fired on me with what I
ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.829
I returned fire and sought cover...

07:38.041 --> 07:41.078
...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.959
When he paused to reload...

07:45.465 --> 07:47.541
...I was able to take
an effective shot.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.132
Agent Schrader...

07:51.346 --> 07:54.762
...what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.680
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.468
- I was tending to another matter.
- What other matter?

08:04.902 --> 08:06.610
An unrelated family matter.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.858
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.575
- Your brother-in-law?
- Yes, sir. He's since been found.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.537
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.656
At the time, he'd been missing
for hours...

08:18.874 --> 08:22.373
...and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.495
I was talking to his acquaintances...

08:24.713 --> 08:26.955
...trying to get a fix
on his whereabouts.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.757
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his...

08:30.969 --> 08:34.089
...a Jesse Pinkman.

08:34.306 --> 08:38.885
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

08:39.102 --> 08:42.353
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

08:42.564 --> 08:46.265
- Have you run him down yet?
- Not yet, but we're working on it.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.570
Man, they're like
Jehovah's Witnesses.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.202
They don't give up.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.665
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

09:05.879 --> 09:09.165
- They need probable cause.
- Probable cause?

09:09.383 --> 09:11.174
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

09:11.385 --> 09:14.754
I told you, this is serious shit.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.012
I'm like an outlaw.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.387
Okay.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.359
Let's do this.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.784
Holy Christ!

09:44.293 --> 09:45.455
You're Willy Wonka.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.421
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.709
Put me on your magical boat, man.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.045
Sail me down
your chocolaty river of meth.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.590
So where you keep the pseudo?

09:56.805 --> 10:00.554
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.433
With that, you don't need pseudo.
Come on, help me out, man.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.390
No pseudo?

10:06.857 --> 10:10.807
Come to me, beautiful baby.
I'm gonna be so good to you.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.733
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.649
But I can't just let you
break this down.

10:18.869 --> 10:21.490
- That'd be sacrilege.
- I told you, that's why we're here.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.330
- You saw the cops. Right?
- Sure.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.865
But couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

10:26.084 --> 10:28.836
- You know, for the road?
- No, forget it, all right?

10:29.046 --> 10:32.878
- This stuff has to go, like, now.
- Dude, you owe me.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.760
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.549
God, Badger!

10:40.974 --> 10:44.390
Don't mess with me.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.018
Got it?

10:49.900 --> 10:52.652
Yeah, I got it.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.955
Oh, my God.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.546
Okay, that's all of it.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.429
This was a bad choice.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.602
You sure about this guy?

11:27.813 --> 11:29.971
He's totally, totally cool.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.934
He's my cousin.

11:35.737 --> 11:39.569
- Yo, what'd we say, 500?
- We didn't say, and it's 1000.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.158
Thousand bucks?

11:41.368 --> 11:44.037
Come on, where you towing it,
man, Seattle?

11:44.413 --> 11:46.037
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.917
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...

11:55.716 --> 11:56.996
...560.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.295
- You know what?
- Hey... No...

11:59.511 --> 12:02.382
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.

12:02.598 --> 12:06.097
He's totally good for it.
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

12:06.310 --> 12:10.473
- That right? You a stand-up dude?
- Yeah, I am.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.895
I will get you the other 500.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.271
Five hundred more.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.728
Your word's your bond, right?

12:18.405 --> 12:19.780
Right.

12:25.621 --> 12:30.033
I saved your skinny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.289
What are you doing now, exactly?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.378
I'm giving you, like, two hours...

12:35.589 --> 12:39.040
...and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.801
You're not using your own name.

12:41.011 --> 12:45.803
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
like, what you said, but why?

12:46.016 --> 12:48.056
Why do you gotta go and do this?

12:48.685 --> 12:50.927
They need probable cause.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.475
I'm giving it to them.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.741
What's the last thing
you remember?

13:08.872 --> 13:12.490
Well, I was driving home.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.323
I think.

13:15.796 --> 13:16.958
And...

13:17.881 --> 13:19.423
Do you remember coming home?

13:20.384 --> 13:22.756
You came in, and I asked
why you were out of breath?

13:25.806 --> 13:29.506
You don't remember talking to me
when I was in the bathtub?

13:30.394 --> 13:32.137
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

13:32.354 --> 13:37.693
- Nothing else? No fleeting images?
- Well, no. I...

13:39.027 --> 13:40.225
I was...

13:40.445 --> 13:47.029
I was walking down some road
or highway...

13:47.953 --> 13:50.409
...with a lot of headlights...

13:50.622 --> 13:54.750
...and I remember feeling fear.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.998
- That's it.
- All right. Thank you.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.215
Well, there's definitely
some good news here.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.917
The MRI shows no metastases.

14:05.137 --> 14:08.007
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

14:08.223 --> 14:10.050
Yeah, we're looking really good.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.010
Oh, thank God.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.935
So, what was it, then?

14:16.148 --> 14:19.517
- There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
- And considering your condition...

14:19.735 --> 14:21.395
...the blood panel looks good.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.732
Then what are we talking about?
What happened?

14:25.115 --> 14:28.199
As of right now, we really...

14:28.410 --> 14:29.785
...can't say.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.409
Forgive me.
Granted, this is not my field...

14:33.624 --> 14:36.245
...but isn't it possible
that this had something to do...

14:36.460 --> 14:38.583
...with all the prescriptions
I've been taking?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.338
There's the antiemetic...

14:40.547 --> 14:42.374
...the antitussive...

14:42.591 --> 14:46.090
...the this, the that.
Not to mention the chemo itself.

14:48.263 --> 14:52.641
And being off all of them
for the past few days, I have to say...

14:52.851 --> 14:54.725
...I'm feeling much better.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.510
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
these medications...

14:57.731 --> 15:00.222
...the information sheets
are as long as your arm.

15:00.442 --> 15:04.440
I mean, it's page after page
of side effects and warnings.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.858
Right, exactly.
Could it be that simple?

15:08.075 --> 15:11.775
Well, we'll take
another look at that, sure.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.866
Walt, I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out lately.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.076
Stressed out? I...

15:17.292 --> 15:19.285
- No, I don't think I'm...
- Walt, please.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.792
Stressed out is putting it...

15:22.005 --> 15:23.250
...mildly.

15:25.467 --> 15:31.054
Well, I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately, but as I've said...

15:31.265 --> 15:32.925
...I'm feeling much better.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.811
Shouldn't we be talking
about when I can get out of here?

15:36.019 --> 15:38.937
Well, that may still be
a ways down the road.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.691
A ways down the road?

15:41.900 --> 15:46.064
Actually, I think our next move
is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

15:48.156 --> 15:51.490
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

15:51.702 --> 15:54.027
Nobody likes being in the hospital.
I get that.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.494
But until we know
what caused this incident...

15:56.707 --> 15:59.079
...we can't be certain it won't recur.

16:42.836 --> 16:46.039
- That your last hit?
- Yeah.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.545
Finish it quick.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.367
Show your hands.
Get on your stomach now.

17:23.585 --> 17:27.583
Get on your stomach now!
Get over. Roll! Do it now!

17:33.762 --> 17:35.636
I'm going, I'm going.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.635
What's going on?

17:37.850 --> 17:39.842
What did I do?

17:43.146 --> 17:44.771
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.130
- What, man?
- Tell me again.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.419
Again?

18:10.632 --> 18:13.467
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and I were partying, that's it.

18:13.677 --> 18:16.631
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

18:16.847 --> 18:20.180
Just bumping uglies and smoking that
crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?

18:20.392 --> 18:21.767
Taco? I don't know any Taco...

18:21.977 --> 18:24.550
...and I damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.396
Three days,
you must have got hungry.

18:26.607 --> 18:27.852
Yeah, I guess.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.355
- You order take-out?
- Yeah.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.562
Yeah, where from?

18:33.030 --> 18:35.402
You get yourself a little
of that moo goo gai pan...

18:35.616 --> 18:37.739
...from that chink place
around the corner?

18:37.951 --> 18:41.652
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

18:41.872 --> 18:43.496
You know, Funyuns.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.166
I had a Hot Pocket.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.866
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

18:48.086 --> 18:49.711
You didn't notice your car
was gone?

18:49.922 --> 18:52.460
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.750
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

18:54.968 --> 18:57.008
Management's gonna
be on my ass for sure.

18:57.221 --> 19:00.175
- You weren't answering your phone.
- It was in my car.

19:01.517 --> 19:03.177
- That right?
- Yeah.

19:04.937 --> 19:07.225
We found your car...

19:07.439 --> 19:09.562
...but your phone wasn't in it.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.269
You found my car?

19:12.110 --> 19:13.521
You found my car?

19:13.737 --> 19:17.071
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.859
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...?

19:23.080 --> 19:25.701
Did you leave anything else
in the car?

19:25.916 --> 19:27.031
Like what?

19:28.877 --> 19:30.669
Like what? Like...

19:30.879 --> 19:33.204
I don't know. Like this?

19:41.098 --> 19:46.554
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
and 20 dollars.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.395
That's not mine.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.397
That's not yours?

19:50.941 --> 19:53.397
He says it's not his, Gomie.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.936
Gee, I really thought
this might be yours.

19:56.154 --> 19:59.737
- I wish.
- Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.

19:59.950 --> 20:02.026
You know what we got here,
Gomie, don't you?

20:02.244 --> 20:05.114
That's a new interdiction van
right there, yeah.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.821
Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.701
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.326
I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

20:13.672 --> 20:15.878
So who's your chief, little Injun?

20:16.091 --> 20:17.585
What?

20:17.801 --> 20:20.802
- What does that even mean?
- I think your story's bullshit.

20:21.013 --> 20:23.468
I think you know
who Tuco Salamanca was.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.591
Your car was there
because you were there.

20:26.143 --> 20:30.093
Tuco had a bullet in him when I
got there and you know about that too.

20:31.148 --> 20:33.187
So, what are you saying?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.309
I shot someone?

20:35.527 --> 20:38.979
- With, like, a gun?
- You?

20:39.656 --> 20:41.067
No.

20:41.283 --> 20:44.367
Only shooting you do
is into a Kleenex.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.702
But I think you know
the badass who did.

20:48.957 --> 20:53.370
Look, I was partying with Wendy,
okay?

20:54.213 --> 20:56.834
Funyuns and boom-boom.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.085
No.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.128
I don't think so.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.463
Tell you what. We're gonna...

21:04.681 --> 21:08.679
...go talk to that skinny yeast factory
of a girlfriend you got.

21:08.894 --> 21:10.554
And you know what?

21:12.731 --> 21:16.598
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
roll on you.

21:20.239 --> 21:22.112
Don't go nowhere.

21:35.921 --> 21:39.919
Where's my root beer? Come on.
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.170
- I got medical issues.
- Medical issues?

21:43.387 --> 21:45.344
Like, what kind of medical issues?

21:45.556 --> 21:47.216
You got penis withdrawal?

21:47.432 --> 21:49.758
You got schlongus interruptus?

21:50.727 --> 21:53.016
Wendy, listen. Talk to me...

21:53.230 --> 21:55.057
...and you get a root beer
and a tinkle.

21:55.274 --> 21:57.231
- Tell me the last three days.
- I told you...

21:57.442 --> 21:59.980
...we were shacked up
since Saturday.

22:00.195 --> 22:03.398
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

22:04.199 --> 22:07.117
Not even for a second?

22:08.829 --> 22:11.450
For a second? I don't know, maybe.

22:11.665 --> 22:13.408
Maybe?

22:13.625 --> 22:15.369
Did Jesse leave the room?

22:16.545 --> 22:18.288
He did, didn't he?

22:19.006 --> 22:21.876
Wendy, you can do it.
You can do it, Wendy.

22:22.676 --> 22:25.345
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

22:25.846 --> 22:29.179
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

22:30.893 --> 22:33.348
It's you. I know you.

22:33.562 --> 22:36.895
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.851
- What?
- The kid with the crutches.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.356
- The football player.
- How about we stay on topic?

22:41.570 --> 22:45.650
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

22:45.866 --> 22:48.653
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

22:48.869 --> 22:50.577
And that's all I'm saying about that.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.361
Now, come on.

22:52.581 --> 22:54.739
Where's my root beer?

22:58.128 --> 23:00.370
You wanted her to bang
a football player, pervert?

23:00.589 --> 23:02.083
It's a long story, Gomie.

23:02.299 --> 23:05.798
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

23:06.011 --> 23:09.178
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

23:16.313 --> 23:18.471
And how are you sleeping?

23:21.985 --> 23:24.357
Fine. Most nights.

23:24.863 --> 23:25.859
Good.

23:26.073 --> 23:28.445
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts or images...

23:28.659 --> 23:30.782
...things you can't
get out of your head?

23:36.041 --> 23:38.449
How about feelings of guilt
or persecution?

23:38.669 --> 23:42.453
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude...

23:42.840 --> 23:45.627
...but where is this going, exactly?

23:45.843 --> 23:49.212
We're starting a process, Walt.
An ongoing process.

23:49.429 --> 23:53.130
- Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
- Ongoing for how long?

23:53.350 --> 23:54.630
I just met you. Hard to say.

23:54.852 --> 23:57.852
We could be talking about days,
weeks, months.

23:59.523 --> 24:03.141
Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.640
Now...

24:04.862 --> 24:10.152
...if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

24:10.868 --> 24:12.990
Walt...

24:13.203 --> 24:16.738
...a fugue state
is a very serious event.

24:16.957 --> 24:19.080
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

24:19.293 --> 24:20.372
Get into a situation...

24:20.586 --> 24:22.495
...where you could be shot
by the police?

24:22.713 --> 24:24.373
We can't allow you to leave...

24:24.590 --> 24:27.674
...until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

24:27.885 --> 24:30.636
Saying you feel fine
doesn't solve this.

24:36.685 --> 24:39.472
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

24:39.688 --> 24:40.851
It's very straightforward.

24:41.064 --> 24:44.433
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.932
What about my family?

24:46.153 --> 24:49.486
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

24:49.698 --> 24:52.319
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

24:52.534 --> 24:56.199
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

24:57.956 --> 25:00.032
And you, as a medical practitioner...

25:00.250 --> 25:02.409
...you abide
by these strictures absolutely.

25:02.628 --> 25:03.956
Yes.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.423
All right.

25:14.264 --> 25:16.173
There was no fugue state.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.094
I remember everything.

25:24.733 --> 25:26.773
The truth is...

25:26.985 --> 25:30.604
...I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

25:30.822 --> 25:34.238
I just had to get out...

25:34.952 --> 25:36.114
...and so I left.

25:36.328 --> 25:38.486
I didn't think about it.
I just did it.

25:38.705 --> 25:45.075
I walked for a long time, and when I
couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

25:45.963 --> 25:48.750
I got as far as Gallup...

25:52.219 --> 25:55.303
...and then it was just time
to come home.

25:55.514 --> 25:57.091
So...

25:57.307 --> 26:00.142
...being found naked
in a supermarket...

26:00.352 --> 26:03.887
...that was your way
of giving credibility to a lie?

26:04.106 --> 26:07.309
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

26:14.992 --> 26:16.700
Why run away?

26:16.910 --> 26:19.947
What did you feel
you had to run from?

26:26.086 --> 26:28.079
Doctor, my wife
is seven months pregnant...

26:28.297 --> 26:30.289
...with a baby we didn't intend.

26:31.341 --> 26:34.960
My 15-year-old son
has cerebral palsy.

26:35.179 --> 26:39.508
I am an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

26:39.725 --> 26:44.517
When I can work,
I make $43,700 per year.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.769
I have watched
all of my colleagues...

26:46.982 --> 26:49.354
...and friends surpass me
in every way imaginable...

26:49.568 --> 26:53.435
...and within 18 months,
I will be dead.

26:55.574 --> 26:58.065
And you ask why I ran?

27:32.152 --> 27:33.730
Gomie, you wanna do the honors?

27:43.288 --> 27:44.996
- What's that mean?
- That means yes.

27:45.207 --> 27:49.205
- Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
- Come on, this is bullshit.

27:49.419 --> 27:53.038
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
even know what planet he's living on.

27:53.257 --> 27:54.715
Señor...

27:55.342 --> 27:57.050
...are we on the planet Mars?

28:00.973 --> 28:02.716
Are we on the planet Saturn?

28:05.143 --> 28:06.768
Are we on the planet Earth?

28:09.439 --> 28:12.559
Señor, is today Friday?

28:13.026 --> 28:14.402
Is today Monday?

28:15.571 --> 28:17.148
Is today Tuesday?

28:17.906 --> 28:20.480
Okay, seems like he's all there.
Let's go for it.

28:22.661 --> 28:23.824
Señor...

28:25.414 --> 28:28.249
...was this man
at your house yesterday?

28:35.757 --> 28:40.336
Señor, was this man
at your house yesterday?

28:48.187 --> 28:51.104
This guy right here,
he was at your house, right?

28:51.315 --> 28:53.556
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

28:55.444 --> 28:59.442
Señor, are you scared of this man?

29:00.991 --> 29:03.447
No, he's not scared.

29:07.164 --> 29:09.406
Come on, Granddad.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.866
Don't you wanna help us out?

29:29.186 --> 29:31.309
Oh, man.

29:38.779 --> 29:40.321
I guess that's a no.

29:42.699 --> 29:45.321
- I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

29:45.536 --> 29:47.658
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years
in San Quentin.

29:47.871 --> 29:50.908
Stroke or no stroke, old-school
gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.

29:51.124 --> 29:55.169
- All right. It was worth a try at least.
- We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

29:55.379 --> 29:57.288
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

29:57.506 --> 29:59.582
You telling me you buy
that lame-ass story?

29:59.800 --> 30:03.085
I buy that lame-ass story more than
I buy he had anything to do...

30:03.303 --> 30:05.379
...with shooting Tuco, man.

30:07.224 --> 30:09.845
Dad? Hey, Dad.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.851
Hey, can you hear me?

30:12.855 --> 30:15.725
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm...

30:17.234 --> 30:18.230
What's...?

30:18.443 --> 30:21.397
She did?
No, I didn't get any messages.

30:21.613 --> 30:23.357
You know, I actually...

30:23.574 --> 30:26.325
...lost my phone, and I've been
too busy to get a new one.

30:26.535 --> 30:27.733
I've been busy as...

30:27.953 --> 30:29.827
As totally productive.

30:30.038 --> 30:33.324
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

30:33.542 --> 30:36.827
Yeah, yeah, data entry,
like we talked about.

30:37.045 --> 30:39.501
Yeah, I'm totally amped.

30:39.715 --> 30:42.040
Hey, could you give me a ride?

30:42.259 --> 30:46.672
I'm actually...
I'm downtown and my car's in the...

30:49.558 --> 30:51.467
Oh, no.
Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will...

30:51.685 --> 30:55.386
I'll call you later
when you have some...

30:56.231 --> 30:58.140
Okay. Yeah. No. I...

30:58.358 --> 31:00.980
I get it. I get it.

31:01.195 --> 31:03.567
Okay, bye.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.867
Thanks.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.835
So, what are you doing now?

31:18.045 --> 31:20.002
Waffle House?

31:22.132 --> 31:23.413
Waffle House is good.

31:58.126 --> 31:59.122
Pay phone?

31:59.336 --> 32:02.005
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed.

32:02.214 --> 32:03.210
So how did it go?

32:05.175 --> 32:06.634
Okay. You?

32:06.844 --> 32:11.137
They sweated me plenty,
but they finally cut me loose.

32:11.473 --> 32:13.680
- So you getting out of there?
- Tomorrow.

32:13.892 --> 32:15.885
So who came for you?

32:16.103 --> 32:17.846
The DEA? What did they ask you?

32:18.063 --> 32:21.514
Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law...

32:21.733 --> 32:23.276
...took my rainy-day fund.

32:23.485 --> 32:25.277
Your what? What is that?

32:25.487 --> 32:28.737
My rainy-day fund.
Sixty-eight thousand, okay?

32:28.949 --> 32:30.858
Cue-ball son of a bitch
laughed in my face.

32:31.076 --> 32:32.985
Now I got like 80 bucks
to my name.

32:33.203 --> 32:34.579
Wait, wait. What does he know?

32:34.788 --> 32:36.366
Does he know it's your money?

32:36.582 --> 32:39.073
No, man.
He doesn't know shit, okay?

32:39.293 --> 32:40.835
The plan worked.

32:41.044 --> 32:42.242
They bought it.

32:42.462 --> 32:44.918
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

32:45.132 --> 32:49.260
- Did he mention my name?
- No. Thanks for caring.

32:51.638 --> 32:54.343
- What about the basement?
- It's clean.

32:54.558 --> 32:56.515
And the RV?

32:56.727 --> 33:00.559
Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
It's safe.

33:00.772 --> 33:03.098
Can he get it running again?

33:04.359 --> 33:06.933
- Why?
- So we can cook.

33:08.155 --> 33:09.898
So you still wanna cook?

33:10.115 --> 33:11.574
Seriously?

33:13.285 --> 33:15.527
What's changed, Jesse?

33:24.838 --> 33:27.543
Seven-hundred
thirty-seven thousand.

33:27.758 --> 33:29.715
Twenty-one pounds...

33:29.927 --> 33:32.252
...minus cash on hand...

33:33.096 --> 33:34.211
Cash on hand.

36:09.920 --> 36:14.381
- Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
- No, I was awake.

36:15.384 --> 36:19.713
- Want some cornflakes?
- Yeah, sure.

36:25.769 --> 36:28.141
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:29.726 --> 38:31.719
Southwest Aniline again?

38:33.188 --> 38:34.184
What's this?

38:34.398 --> 38:36.723
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homey.

38:36.942 --> 38:40.393
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
than Charlie Manson was yours.

38:40.612 --> 38:42.938
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

38:43.574 --> 38:45.483
P2P, huh?

38:45.701 --> 38:47.243
So, what are you thinking?

38:47.452 --> 38:49.326
The two stooges over here
cooked it?

38:50.163 --> 38:53.497
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

38:53.709 --> 38:55.203
At least since this.

38:55.711 --> 38:58.036
- Krazy-8.
- Yeah.

38:59.339 --> 39:02.257
Krazy-8, Tuco...

39:02.926 --> 39:06.176
Somehow, some way,
it's all connected.

39:06.972 --> 39:09.214
A simple explanation...

39:09.433 --> 39:11.971
...only I'm not seeing it,
and it's making my head hurt.

39:12.186 --> 39:14.723
That's because you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

39:14.938 --> 39:17.227
It's dead around here.
Let's get a couple of beers.

39:17.774 --> 39:19.352
It's 11 in the morning.

39:19.568 --> 39:20.564
I'm buying.

39:20.777 --> 39:22.022
You're buying? Holy crap.

39:22.237 --> 39:25.072
- What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
- Oh, yeah.

39:28.452 --> 39:30.907
Surprise.

39:31.622 --> 39:34.825
You little sneaky bastard, you.

39:35.417 --> 39:36.662
Very nice work.

39:37.669 --> 39:38.914
Thank you, sir.

39:41.089 --> 39:43.497
- What's this?
- Look what we got you.

39:44.468 --> 39:46.840
- Look at that, I love it.
- They got the gut right.

39:47.054 --> 39:49.093
- Hey.
- There you go.

39:49.306 --> 39:50.931
- Hey, thanks, man.
- Thank you.

39:53.143 --> 39:56.927
We all got you a little something,
and this is from all of us.

39:57.147 --> 39:59.104
You shouldn't have.

39:59.942 --> 40:03.441
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.

40:03.654 --> 40:05.362
I love it.

40:10.536 --> 40:12.445
You going to finish
your apple juice?

40:13.830 --> 40:15.455
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.

40:17.292 --> 40:19.036
You're supposed to drink it.

40:19.253 --> 40:22.669
The nurse said
you have to stay hydrated.

40:23.298 --> 40:24.923
But I'm not thirsty.

40:25.133 --> 40:28.384
Dad. Drink it.

40:38.313 --> 40:41.314
Hey.

40:41.525 --> 40:43.268
Better late than never, huh?

40:43.485 --> 40:45.394
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:46.530 --> 40:48.238
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

40:48.448 --> 40:50.488
I see
the mark of the beast there, huh?

40:50.701 --> 40:52.859
Oh, yeah.
Marie stopped by this morning.

40:53.078 --> 40:55.949
They really cheer the place up.

40:57.541 --> 41:00.162
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.

41:00.377 --> 41:03.828
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you freeloading bastard.

41:04.339 --> 41:07.127
So tell us about the shootout.

41:07.342 --> 41:10.676
I was, you know, just doing my job.

41:10.888 --> 41:13.343
Whole thing was over
in about five seconds.

41:13.557 --> 41:15.466
Say, Walt, you know...

41:15.684 --> 41:18.389
...how are you?

41:19.104 --> 41:20.349
I'm okay.

41:20.564 --> 41:23.137
Really, I'm feeling fine.

41:23.483 --> 41:25.642
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:25.861 --> 41:28.696
The doctor is calling it a...

41:28.906 --> 41:32.950
An isolated episode of
transient global amnesia.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.702
Damn.

41:34.912 --> 41:36.536
Which means non-recurring.

41:36.747 --> 41:38.905
Non-recurring.
That sounds good, yeah.

41:39.124 --> 41:40.535
Sounds real good.

41:40.751 --> 41:44.369
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
You really gave us a scare.

41:44.588 --> 41:47.423
Listen, Hank.

41:48.383 --> 41:49.961
I don't know what to say. I mean...

41:50.177 --> 41:56.096
...you going out there looking for me
put you in danger, and I'm so...

41:56.308 --> 41:59.973
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut it. Not nearly.

42:00.187 --> 42:02.760
No, no, no. Is that what you're
worried about? Forget it.

42:02.981 --> 42:06.397
Look, the office, they're treating me
like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?

42:06.610 --> 42:09.896
They threw me a party, the gals
baked me a chocolate-chip cake...

42:10.113 --> 42:12.106
...like you wouldn't believe, okay?

42:12.324 --> 42:15.491
You ought to disappear more often.

42:15.702 --> 42:18.075
Just kidding. Don't do that.

42:18.830 --> 42:20.953
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

42:21.166 --> 42:22.744
Look what they gave me.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.205
What is it?

42:24.419 --> 42:28.880
That, gentlemen,
is the grill of the guy I shot.

42:29.925 --> 42:31.300
- His grill?
- Yeah.

42:31.510 --> 42:34.083
It kind of goes over the front teeth
like that, you know?

42:34.304 --> 42:36.593
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

42:36.807 --> 42:39.428
You know, certain folks
are attracted to shiny things.

42:39.643 --> 42:41.434
Wow, cool.

42:41.645 --> 42:42.641
Yeah.

43:08.672 --> 43:11.424
I can't tell you how good it feels
to be home.

43:18.682 --> 43:20.556
I'll get these in the wash.

43:20.767 --> 43:22.096
Okay.

43:58.722 --> 44:00.880
Say, honey, I...

44:01.099 --> 44:06.058
I was just thinking about going out
to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?

44:12.069 --> 44:15.769
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?

44:27.709 --> 44:29.951
Skyler, listen to me.

44:32.589 --> 44:35.543
This will not happen again, okay?

44:35.759 --> 44:36.874
I won't let it.

44:38.095 --> 44:40.586
I'm still here. I'm me...

44:41.723 --> 44:44.179
...and we're gonna be okay.

44:50.107 --> 44:51.767
Walt...

44:54.736 --> 44:56.610
...do you have a second cell phone?

44:59.950 --> 45:01.444
A second cell phone?

45:01.660 --> 45:05.871
The night you disappeared, you came
in when I was taking a bath...

45:06.081 --> 45:08.157
...and you were very upset.

45:09.001 --> 45:11.918
It was like something
terrible had happened.

45:12.129 --> 45:14.964
And then your cell phone rang.

45:15.174 --> 45:18.424
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up...

45:18.635 --> 45:21.091
...and just disappeared.

45:22.848 --> 45:24.307
Yeah.

45:24.516 --> 45:26.805
And when Hank
checked your phone records...

45:27.019 --> 45:30.020
...there was no call.

45:30.480 --> 45:33.932
No call on the phone I know about.

45:38.822 --> 45:40.447
That is...

45:40.657 --> 45:42.365
...odd.

45:43.118 --> 45:45.526
I mean, I don't remember
any of that...

45:45.746 --> 45:50.704
...but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

45:53.462 --> 45:55.004
Okay.
