00:21.480 --> 00:22.855
Hey.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.145
You...

00:27.736 --> 00:29.479
You selling?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.274
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.697
Okay. That's cool.

00:37.204 --> 00:41.202
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling...

00:41.542 --> 00:43.914
...I could maybe do with a teenth.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.498
You're kidding, right?

00:49.508 --> 00:51.833
Dude, I so smell bacon.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.341
What? What are you talking about?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.215
Oh, gee, I don't know.

00:56.431 --> 00:59.267
How about over there.
That brown van.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.640
That's yours, right?

01:01.854 --> 01:03.763
What brown van?

01:04.022 --> 01:06.145
Parked all inconspicuous.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.434
It's a cop van.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.697
Yeah, another one right over there.

01:12.531 --> 01:15.152
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.407
Can't you at least be original?

01:17.619 --> 01:20.027
Dude, I just wanna get high.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.453
A flower van.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.788
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.960
Seriously, and I don't mean
to disrespect...

01:28.172 --> 01:30.745
...but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck...

01:30.966 --> 01:33.042
...there's no way
I'm seriously thinking...

01:33.260 --> 01:36.546
...that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.381
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.758
Think about it, boys.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.807
All right. I'm hitting it.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.481
You dudes give up that easy?

01:48.692 --> 01:50.685
I'm not a cop.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.861
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.117
All right, you know what?

01:58.327 --> 02:01.114
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.406
I'm blinded by white.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.619
Douchebag.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.324
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.913
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.424
I mean, what are you
complaining about?

02:14.635 --> 02:16.876
You got abs, man. Kind of.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.969
Whatever, dude.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.889
I'm not even sure
I wanna buy anymore.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.769
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.017
Come on. Don't be like that.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.433
I just need you to prove it,
you know?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.144
Prove you're not a cop.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.064
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

02:34.947 --> 02:36.607
I don't know.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.193
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.155
Which dude?

02:43.372 --> 02:44.617
- That dude?
- Yeah.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.287
No way. He'd kick my ass.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.794
True that.

02:51.088 --> 02:54.421
- This is so hard, you know?
- Yeah.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.761
I know.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.804
It's simple.

03:01.139 --> 03:05.469
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.559
It's in the Constitution.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.894
Constitution of America?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.855
So go ahead and ask.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.359
- You a cop?
- No, no. Not like that.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.696
Ask it, like, official.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.482
Are you a police officer?

03:23.036 --> 03:26.571
No, I am not a police officer.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.826
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.835
The price is the price, yo.

03:37.301 --> 03:38.961
All right.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.323
There you go. Enjoy.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.956
Thanks, man.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.043
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

04:19.259 --> 04:23.720
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach! Get on the ground!

04:24.806 --> 04:27.843
Hold it right there. Don't move.
Stay down.

04:49.081 --> 04:53.956
I had a good job
until my boss accused me of stealing.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.127
I'd better call Saul!

05:00.300 --> 05:03.669
I was out partying,
minding my own business...

05:05.097 --> 05:08.596
- You are under arrest.
- I'd better call Saul!

05:09.518 --> 05:10.597
Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.519
Did you know that you have rights?

05:12.729 --> 05:15.185
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.356
I believe that until proven guilty...

05:17.568 --> 05:20.734
...every man, woman,
and child in this country is innocent.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.903
And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.111
Better call Saul.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.400
Saul Goodman, attorney at law,
505-164-CALL.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.619
That's 505-164-CALL.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.996
I really need to get some furniture.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.795
I suggest you start with a bed.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.754
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.303
- Well, you can't.
- Yeah, no. I know.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.507
I'm just saying.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.762
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.853
You better seriously hope
that airs out.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.816
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.312
He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.155
Yeah?

06:05.365 --> 06:09.577
Has he ever caught you?

06:10.537 --> 06:14.405
Yeah. Many times.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.286
Well, listen.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.330
Since I already lost my deposit
and all...

06:21.548 --> 06:24.122
...maybe we should light up.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.715
No, thanks.

06:29.932 --> 06:30.927
You sure?

06:32.476 --> 06:34.883
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

06:35.103 --> 06:37.345
Maybe you'll change your mind.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.651
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.990
Hey. What'd I say?

06:52.538 --> 06:54.032
Nothing.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.206
I just have to go is all.

07:16.687 --> 07:17.682
What's this?

07:19.273 --> 07:20.850
My 18-month chip.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.564
I'm in recovery.

07:24.778 --> 07:30.401
And, you know,
pot is like stepping stones.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.950
Recovery? That's cool.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.494
Right on.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.870
I respect that.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.921
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.048
It's just a sometime thing.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.255
But no more, like, in the house.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.058
So you wanna go grab some dinner?

07:58.270 --> 08:00.761
I could really go for some Chinese.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.440
No, I better hit it.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.853
We...

08:06.195 --> 08:07.772
We cool?

08:11.325 --> 08:12.902
Your satellite is on, by the way.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.578
That screen is badass.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.964
I just think it's asking a lot.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.174
He knows it.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.052
He's done nothing but apologise.

08:40.646 --> 08:42.188
Is this gonna be
every weekend now?

08:42.397 --> 08:45.683
No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

08:45.901 --> 08:50.479
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.070
So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up...

08:53.283 --> 08:55.240
...tell him he better wash
those sneakers.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.448
And I said bye.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.987
And tell him
to let them air-dry this time.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.958
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

09:02.793 --> 09:03.789
What?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.627
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

09:07.840 --> 09:08.919
I mean...

09:09.132 --> 09:10.792
No, it's just you...

09:11.009 --> 09:12.919
You look nice is all.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.343
It's work, Walt.
And everybody is gonna be there.

09:16.515 --> 09:17.511
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.180
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

09:20.394 --> 09:21.805
Okay.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.517
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.987
Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.529
Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.

09:41.748 --> 09:46.245
Skyler? Are you there?
I don't know what to do.

09:46.461 --> 09:50.044
I... I need to talk to you. I...

09:50.257 --> 09:53.792
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

10:00.475 --> 10:03.145
Yesterday I got home
and found him.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.303
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

10:06.815 --> 10:10.231
- A man was killed?
- A Federale, right in front of him.

10:11.153 --> 10:14.522
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

10:14.740 --> 10:18.358
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.364
- The IEDs.
- Oh, Jesus.

10:21.580 --> 10:24.415
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.032
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.502
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.750
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

10:33.967 --> 10:39.803
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

11:03.956 --> 11:05.616
Baby, not now.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.834
It's... It's me, Hank. Sorry.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.631
Hey, buddy. What's...?

11:15.843 --> 11:17.385
What's up?

11:19.763 --> 11:21.305
I just...

11:21.765 --> 11:23.888
Do you mind if I...?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.093
No. No.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.980
So...

11:33.318 --> 11:34.433
How you doing?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.698
Oh, you know, lousy.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.776
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.

11:39.992 --> 11:45.330
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

11:45.581 --> 11:47.289
Better not get too close.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.453
Well, I'll take my chances.

11:58.802 --> 12:02.467
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

12:04.183 --> 12:05.843
Terrible.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.176
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.021
It's like Apocalypse Now
down there.

12:11.231 --> 12:15.063
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.194
And my SAC in El Paso
sends me home.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.775
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

12:24.995 --> 12:28.079
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man...

12:28.290 --> 12:30.366
...on the trail
of those motherless bastards...

12:30.584 --> 12:33.075
...you send him home. You know?

12:33.587 --> 12:36.208
I was, you know...
"He's out getting an evidence bag...

12:36.423 --> 12:38.332
...and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

12:38.550 --> 12:42.050
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

12:44.598 --> 12:47.552
So are you home for good then?

12:48.977 --> 12:51.053
No, no. It's...

12:51.271 --> 12:55.139
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.478
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

13:01.698 --> 13:04.735
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.656
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

13:08.580 --> 13:14.535
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

13:20.801 --> 13:24.929
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I...

13:26.932 --> 13:29.008
You know, the things I deal with...

13:30.227 --> 13:33.477
...you and me don't have much of a...

13:33.689 --> 13:37.733
What you might call
"an experiential overlap."

13:45.993 --> 13:48.400
What if I told you we do?

13:55.919 --> 14:00.380
I have spent my whole life scared.

14:02.426 --> 14:05.546
Frightened of things
that could happen...

14:05.762 --> 14:08.088
...might happen, might not happen.

14:08.307 --> 14:11.806
Fifty years I spent like that.

14:13.604 --> 14:17.138
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.569
But you know what?

14:23.572 --> 14:26.145
Ever since my diagnosis...

14:27.701 --> 14:29.777
...I sleep just fine.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.036
Okay.

14:37.753 --> 14:43.043
And I came to realize
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.417
That's the real enemy.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.764
So...

14:52.017 --> 14:53.428
Get up.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.183
Get out in the real world.

14:56.813 --> 15:01.559
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.293
Do it again. Go on.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.552
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.178
You and I,
we are gonna feed this machine.

15:32.391 --> 15:36.009
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.021
Not yours, I take it.

15:46.989 --> 15:52.149
We got 10, 20, 30...

15:52.369 --> 15:57.364
...44, five each.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.703
Three pounds should be 48 each.

16:02.921 --> 16:03.952
Who's short?

16:04.173 --> 16:06.924
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.091
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.591
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter...

16:11.805 --> 16:13.513
...so he's probably still in the sack.

16:13.724 --> 16:17.591
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.267
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.972
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

16:23.192 --> 16:25.599
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

16:26.737 --> 16:28.895
Jack-off.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.283
It's going straight to voice-mail.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.787
Voicemail?

16:37.706 --> 16:41.040
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

16:46.298 --> 16:47.543
- Combo.
- Yo, what's up?

16:47.758 --> 16:49.964
You seen Badger?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.885
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.967
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

17:11.907 --> 17:13.235
Well?

17:17.371 --> 17:19.577
They were too scared to tell me.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.832
Badger got busted.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.834
He's in jail.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.616
Honey, I'm home!

18:04.835 --> 18:07.041
Too slow! What's up?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.045
Got more lives than a damn cat.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.213
Now if I could only learn
to lick myself.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.545
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

18:15.762 --> 18:19.546
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

18:19.766 --> 18:23.017
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

18:46.502 --> 18:47.581
You okay?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.289
Hanging in?

18:49.505 --> 18:51.212
What's it look like?

18:52.007 --> 18:54.759
- What's this from A.P.D.?
- Been checking with them to see...

18:54.968 --> 18:57.424
...if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.093
Sure enough, last night.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.715
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

19:02.935 --> 19:06.220
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.439
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

19:09.566 --> 19:11.938
Yeah. Well, all right.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.942
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.566
I feel manipulated.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.360
I thought we were gonna hang out.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.070
We are hanging out, Badger.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.612
You like Badger or Brandon?

19:24.456 --> 19:28.917
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.290
Badger, listen.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.249
Hey.

19:32.673 --> 19:34.998
I'm trying to help you here, man.

19:35.551 --> 19:39.880
Now, if you just tell me
who your supplier is...

19:40.097 --> 19:43.014
...I think this can end
very well for you.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.221
What are you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

19:47.437 --> 19:48.469
You sneaky Pete.

19:49.815 --> 19:51.143
Which is which?

19:51.358 --> 19:53.766
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

19:53.986 --> 19:55.777
You guys get younger every...

19:55.988 --> 19:57.648
What'd you say to baby face?

19:57.865 --> 19:59.275
Did you say anything stupid?

19:59.491 --> 20:01.484
By "anything stupid,"
I mean anything at all.

20:01.702 --> 20:04.157
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.696
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

20:06.915 --> 20:10.165
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.535
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

20:12.754 --> 20:16.455
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.007
All right.

20:22.181 --> 20:23.924
Who do we have?

20:24.641 --> 20:25.839
Brandon Mayhew.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.345
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.936
Brandon Mayhew.

20:34.902 --> 20:37.772
- Here we go. Public masturbation.
- What?

20:37.988 --> 20:40.859
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home...

20:41.074 --> 20:44.693
...with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

20:44.912 --> 20:47.403
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

20:47.623 --> 20:49.532
That ain't me, man. I...

20:49.750 --> 20:54.495
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.540
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.881
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.715
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

21:02.930 --> 21:05.847
Yeah, and felony quantity.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.346
- Just barely.
- Yeah, just barely.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.597
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.687
But good luck arguing that in court.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.609
Let me get down to brass tacks.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.526
I'm gonna get you
a second phone call.

21:18.737 --> 21:20.730
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy...

21:20.948 --> 21:23.320
...or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader...

21:23.534 --> 21:26.653
...and they're gonna
deliver me a check for $4650.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.492
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.244
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

21:32.459 --> 21:36.587
And I need that in a cashier's check
or a money order, doesn't matter.

21:36.797 --> 21:39.252
Actually, I want it in a money order.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.218
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

21:42.427 --> 21:44.883
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

21:45.097 --> 21:47.136
It's done just for tax purposes.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.887
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...

21:50.102 --> 21:53.969
...but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

21:54.189 --> 21:55.220
Any questions?

21:58.277 --> 22:00.150
You're gonna get me off, right?

22:01.238 --> 22:05.022
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

22:05.659 --> 22:08.909
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

22:09.454 --> 22:12.906
Son, I promise you this.

22:13.125 --> 22:16.245
I will give you
the best criminal defense...

22:16.461 --> 22:17.837
...that money can buy.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.921
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.842
Didn't I take these already?

22:24.052 --> 22:27.006
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.096
It's bad for the liver.

22:30.684 --> 22:32.807
Okay, who's next?

22:33.020 --> 22:35.262
Did him. I did him.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.722
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

22:37.941 --> 22:41.026
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

22:41.570 --> 22:43.112
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

22:44.406 --> 22:48.071
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

22:48.285 --> 22:50.906
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

22:51.622 --> 22:54.243
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.201
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

22:56.418 --> 22:59.205
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

22:59.421 --> 23:02.292
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

23:02.508 --> 23:05.627
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

23:19.733 --> 23:21.690
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

23:21.902 --> 23:24.227
You want your exponential growth...

23:24.446 --> 23:26.486
...guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

23:26.698 --> 23:29.616
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

23:29.826 --> 23:31.486
This is who he hires?

23:31.703 --> 23:34.704
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.749
This is the guy I'd hire.

23:38.544 --> 23:39.919
It's the guy you'd hire.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.457
Look, you remember Emilio?

23:41.922 --> 23:44.793
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

23:45.008 --> 23:49.551
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

23:49.763 --> 23:50.926
Dude is like Houdini.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.931
Seriously,
when the going gets tough...

23:53.141 --> 23:54.968
...you don't want a criminal lawyer.

23:55.185 --> 23:58.519
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.522
Know what I'm saying?

24:02.109 --> 24:04.232
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.686
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.862
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

24:09.074 --> 24:13.368
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

24:13.579 --> 24:15.322
And it's only his first dealing rap...

24:15.539 --> 24:18.112
...so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

24:18.333 --> 24:21.868
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

24:23.088 --> 24:27.038
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

24:27.259 --> 24:29.797
Well, I don't need them
seeing my face.

24:30.012 --> 24:33.096
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

24:33.307 --> 24:34.765
Dick.

24:34.975 --> 24:36.469
Fine.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.682
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

24:41.273 --> 24:42.897
Heads.

24:55.746 --> 24:59.079
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

25:12.554 --> 25:14.926
Mr. Mayhew.

25:15.140 --> 25:18.094
Nice of you to come down. Please.

25:18.435 --> 25:19.550
Look at you.

25:19.978 --> 25:23.762
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

25:24.149 --> 25:25.145
Joking.

25:25.359 --> 25:27.435
I... Please, come on.

25:27.653 --> 25:29.444
Come on. Please.

25:29.655 --> 25:31.446
Hello.

25:31.865 --> 25:34.819
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

25:37.454 --> 25:42.282
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

25:46.672 --> 25:49.626
I believe you have
something for me?

25:49.967 --> 25:51.959
Oh, yes.

25:54.596 --> 25:58.926
- Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.

25:59.142 --> 26:01.978
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

26:03.188 --> 26:04.564
My real name is McGill.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.982
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

26:07.192 --> 26:11.237
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

26:11.822 --> 26:14.692
I digress.
Good things are happening.

26:14.908 --> 26:18.740
Fact is, your nephew is gonna
get out in no time.

26:18.954 --> 26:20.578
That's wonderful, yeah.

26:20.789 --> 26:23.161
There's still a few details
to be ironed out...

26:23.375 --> 26:25.332
...but now that the DEA
is involved...

26:25.794 --> 26:29.245
...I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

26:29.464 --> 26:32.833
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.676
- Excuse me, the DEA?
- Yeah.

26:34.887 --> 26:38.469
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

26:41.226 --> 26:43.682
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news...

26:43.896 --> 26:47.430
...but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.645
I understand that.

26:48.859 --> 26:50.567
What does that have
to do with the DEA?

26:50.777 --> 26:52.272
They're after some mystery man...

26:52.487 --> 26:54.943
...some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

26:55.157 --> 26:57.564
They want this guy
like the axe wants the turkey.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.694
Seems young Brandon
may have information...

26:59.912 --> 27:01.738
...that could lead to his arrest.

27:02.289 --> 27:04.282
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

27:04.499 --> 27:07.037
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile...

27:07.252 --> 27:09.209
...and came up
smelling like Paco Rabanne.

27:10.339 --> 27:13.542
Wait, wait. Look, I just... I think...

27:13.759 --> 27:18.884
I just think that we should
review our options.

27:19.097 --> 27:20.508
Options?

27:20.724 --> 27:22.717
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

27:22.935 --> 27:26.517
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

27:26.730 --> 27:28.888
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...

27:29.107 --> 27:31.729
...and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

27:31.944 --> 27:35.562
Look, look. What about reprisals?

27:35.781 --> 27:37.572
I mean, if Badger...

27:37.783 --> 27:43.239
If Brandon informs
on this Heisenberg...

27:43.747 --> 27:45.407
I mean, what if, God forbid...

27:45.624 --> 27:50.416
...that they decide to take revenge?

27:50.629 --> 27:52.420
What have you been telling him?

27:52.631 --> 27:56.047
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"if I talk, they'll kill me."

27:56.260 --> 27:59.177
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

28:00.138 --> 28:03.056
- Good.
- No, that's not good. That's terrible.

28:03.267 --> 28:06.351
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

28:06.562 --> 28:09.231
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.397
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

28:11.608 --> 28:15.273
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

28:15.487 --> 28:20.445
I've been told that
one of them killed another man...

28:20.659 --> 28:24.110
...by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.786
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.451
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

28:31.670 --> 28:34.243
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

28:34.464 --> 28:36.955
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

28:37.176 --> 28:40.509
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary...

28:40.721 --> 28:43.128
...all's right with the world.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.348
Ten thousand dollars.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.820
Ten thousand, cash to you.

29:05.037 --> 29:08.702
I'm not saying to throw the case.

29:08.916 --> 29:13.993
Just no talking to the DEA.

29:15.047 --> 29:17.335
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

29:18.133 --> 29:19.508
Yes.

29:20.385 --> 29:22.177
What's it going to be?

29:24.681 --> 29:27.007
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

29:27.434 --> 29:30.186
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

29:30.395 --> 29:32.055
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

29:32.272 --> 29:33.683
Threatened to call the police.

29:33.899 --> 29:38.857
- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
- Like the Exxon Valdez.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.981
So, what do we do about it?

29:52.668 --> 29:54.707
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

29:54.920 --> 29:55.951
No.

29:56.171 --> 29:57.831
For safety.

29:58.048 --> 29:59.590
What?

30:01.385 --> 30:04.339
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

30:17.025 --> 30:19.563
Talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

30:19.778 --> 30:23.396
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

30:24.658 --> 30:26.734
Oh, no, no, no!

30:26.952 --> 30:29.869
No, it wasn't me.
It was Ignacio. He's the one.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.832
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

30:35.711 --> 30:37.584
Shut up, dude.

30:38.046 --> 30:41.166
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

30:41.383 --> 30:44.254
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

30:44.803 --> 30:48.006
- Who?
- Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

30:48.223 --> 30:50.761
Oh, I thought...

30:51.768 --> 30:53.927
What can I do for you gentlemen?

30:54.146 --> 30:56.553
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

30:56.773 --> 31:00.854
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

31:01.069 --> 31:02.612
You should have taken it.

31:02.821 --> 31:05.905
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

31:06.116 --> 31:08.524
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

31:08.911 --> 31:11.236
The uncle. That was your guy?

31:12.456 --> 31:15.207
No of fence, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

31:15.417 --> 31:17.742
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

31:17.961 --> 31:22.374
- But I'll take your money! Sure!
- No, that offer has expired, yo.

31:22.591 --> 31:26.505
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.428
Just tell me what you need,
all right?

31:28.639 --> 31:30.715
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought...

31:30.933 --> 31:33.221
...and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

31:33.435 --> 31:36.471
All right, listen to me very carefully.

31:36.688 --> 31:38.562
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew...

31:38.774 --> 31:41.894
...the best legal representation ever.

31:42.110 --> 31:44.352
But no deals with the DEA.

31:44.571 --> 31:48.236
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

31:48.450 --> 31:50.988
If he does, you're dead.

31:53.038 --> 31:55.410
Why don't you just kill Badger?

31:58.418 --> 32:01.206
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
is buzzing around you...

32:01.421 --> 32:04.625
...and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the mosquito's attorney.

32:04.842 --> 32:08.257
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

32:08.679 --> 32:11.845
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

32:12.432 --> 32:15.469
- We're not killing Badger, yo!
- Then you got real problems, okay.

32:15.686 --> 32:17.678
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy...

32:17.896 --> 32:19.805
...like a proverbial ton of bricks.

32:20.023 --> 32:22.099
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here...

32:22.317 --> 32:24.109
...but, hey,
he's not gonna like prison.

32:24.319 --> 32:28.815
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

32:34.413 --> 32:35.693
Mr. Mayhew?

32:38.417 --> 32:42.035
I recognise your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

32:42.421 --> 32:43.915
Go on.

32:51.096 --> 32:52.721
- God.
- Take it easy.

32:52.931 --> 32:55.553
Breathe in, breathe out.

32:55.767 --> 32:59.635
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.224
That's better.

33:02.983 --> 33:06.566
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.273
Yeah? How?

33:08.530 --> 33:11.235
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

33:14.077 --> 33:16.236
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

33:16.455 --> 33:19.491
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

33:20.751 --> 33:22.578
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

33:22.794 --> 33:24.419
Come on, make it official.

33:25.422 --> 33:27.165
Come on, do it.

33:28.425 --> 33:31.212
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

33:35.432 --> 33:39.097
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

33:39.770 --> 33:40.801
- Go on.
- Be smart.

33:41.021 --> 33:42.480
What?

33:46.151 --> 33:47.943
- All I got is a five.
- I'll take a five.

33:48.153 --> 33:51.736
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

33:54.076 --> 33:56.152
Okay, you're now both
officially represented...

33:56.370 --> 33:57.947
...by Saul Goodman and Associates.

33:58.163 --> 34:02.540
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment. All right?

34:02.960 --> 34:06.245
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

34:08.173 --> 34:10.130
Just do it.

34:14.763 --> 34:18.132
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table...

34:18.350 --> 34:19.595
And we're sure of that?

34:22.229 --> 34:23.723
No shanking!

34:25.732 --> 34:27.227
All right, all right.

34:27.860 --> 34:32.272
The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

34:36.201 --> 34:38.075
It's just a matter of who.

34:39.538 --> 34:42.788
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...

34:43.000 --> 34:46.499
...your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

34:46.712 --> 34:47.957
Time served, no probation.

34:48.172 --> 34:51.505
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

34:52.426 --> 34:54.798
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

34:55.012 --> 34:57.051
You don't give us
the name of your supplier...

34:57.264 --> 35:00.467
- ...you're going nowhere.
- The tough guy act is unnecessary.

35:00.684 --> 35:02.973
This young man
is cooperating fully.

35:03.187 --> 35:06.104
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperating?

35:10.068 --> 35:12.939
Okay, let's start with a name.

35:15.407 --> 35:17.483
He just goes by Heisenberg.

35:18.035 --> 35:19.030
Heisenberg, huh?

35:20.412 --> 35:21.871
How old is this Heisenberg?

35:22.581 --> 35:26.365
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

35:26.585 --> 35:28.708
- Height?
- Average, I guess.

35:28.921 --> 35:30.794
Medium height, medium weight.

35:31.006 --> 35:34.007
- What color hair?
- No hair.

35:34.218 --> 35:35.842
Dude is balder than you.

35:38.055 --> 35:40.510
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

35:40.724 --> 35:43.215
...is convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

35:43.435 --> 35:46.222
1975, breaking and entering.

35:46.438 --> 35:49.059
1982, grand theft auto.

35:49.274 --> 35:51.600
1984, armed robbery.

35:51.818 --> 35:56.148
1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

35:56.365 --> 35:58.238
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.

35:58.450 --> 36:03.955
City, state and federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

36:04.957 --> 36:07.412
Entire life behind bars.

36:07.918 --> 36:10.160
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

36:10.379 --> 36:13.214
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

36:14.216 --> 36:17.916
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

36:18.846 --> 36:20.755
He's actually
more comfortable inside.

36:20.973 --> 36:23.380
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

36:25.435 --> 36:27.428
Sometime during
the Clinton administration...

36:27.646 --> 36:31.774
...Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

36:36.280 --> 36:41.072
- So when does all this happen?
- It's already happening.

36:41.285 --> 36:42.565
The buy is set for tomorrow.

36:42.786 --> 36:45.455
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy...

36:45.664 --> 36:48.665
...and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound...

36:48.876 --> 36:50.370
...of your finest meth.

36:55.007 --> 36:58.839
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

36:59.052 --> 37:01.259
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.263
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...

37:03.473 --> 37:06.973
...there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

37:07.186 --> 37:09.807
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

37:10.022 --> 37:13.058
- You get 50? For what?
- For facilitating.

37:13.275 --> 37:15.944
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.

37:16.153 --> 37:18.145
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

37:18.363 --> 37:21.448
Look, if this option
is too expensive...

37:21.658 --> 37:25.074
...you can still always... Badger
in the chow line.

37:43.388 --> 37:45.464
Conscience gets expensive,
doesn't it?

38:02.908 --> 38:05.399
All right. There's our boy.

38:06.578 --> 38:08.867
Right on time.

38:25.556 --> 38:28.556
- Go back.
- What? All right, all right, all right.

38:41.446 --> 38:45.065
So, what do you think?
They see us?

38:45.492 --> 38:47.366
No, man, I think we're good.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.867
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

38:55.294 --> 38:56.752
Give me those back.

38:56.962 --> 38:58.919
Just give them to me.

38:59.590 --> 39:01.381
Oh, no.

39:01.967 --> 39:03.165
Where the hell is Jimmy?

39:03.385 --> 39:05.378
Should've been here
10 minutes ago.

39:05.596 --> 39:10.304
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

39:10.893 --> 39:12.885
There's more
than one kind of prison.

39:13.103 --> 39:14.930
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

39:15.147 --> 39:17.602
There he is... Wait a minute.

39:17.816 --> 39:21.351
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What? What? Let me see.

39:22.905 --> 39:25.111
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

39:28.827 --> 39:31.781
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

39:32.831 --> 39:34.491
Time to move?

39:34.791 --> 39:36.831
Not till we see the exchange.

39:39.671 --> 39:42.672
No, no. Oh, shit!

39:42.883 --> 39:45.967
- What?
- Now he shows.

39:49.473 --> 39:51.382
Okay, let's do this.

39:55.562 --> 39:56.891
No, no.

39:57.105 --> 39:59.643
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

39:59.858 --> 40:01.934
We're screwed!

40:02.152 --> 40:03.527
What are you doing?

40:03.737 --> 40:05.860
Hey, what are you doing?

40:09.952 --> 40:11.825
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

40:22.548 --> 40:23.828
Where's the stuff, man?

40:24.049 --> 40:26.172
- Where are we going?
- Just shut up.

40:32.057 --> 40:33.255
Get out. Go stop him.

40:33.475 --> 40:35.883
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

40:36.103 --> 40:37.597
Get out. I'll do something.

40:37.813 --> 40:39.805
- What?
- Just go!

40:52.744 --> 40:54.867
Hank, I thought that was you.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.658
Schrader, I'm blocked.

40:56.874 --> 40:59.625
- Walt, not a good time.
- How you doing? You feeling okay?

40:59.835 --> 41:00.831
Schrader, I'm blocked.

41:01.545 --> 41:03.537
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

41:03.755 --> 41:07.089
- Working? Oh, like DEA working?
- Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

41:07.301 --> 41:09.340
Is something going down?

41:11.597 --> 41:14.135
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

41:20.939 --> 41:22.054
Walt, Walt.

41:22.274 --> 41:24.397
- Walter, move your ass now.
- Okay.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.401
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

41:26.612 --> 41:29.399
- We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
- Should I back up?

41:29.615 --> 41:31.025
- Go that way.
- Forward is better?

41:31.241 --> 41:33.068
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

41:33.285 --> 41:35.741
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

41:35.954 --> 41:38.528
- I'll leave you alone.
- We'll talk later. Just go.

41:39.291 --> 41:42.162
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

41:44.129 --> 41:47.379
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.012
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.

42:05.025 --> 42:08.026
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

42:10.447 --> 42:11.858
Come on, let's get him up.

42:21.667 --> 42:23.327
Jesus!

42:24.336 --> 42:26.163
I think they bought it.

42:29.925 --> 42:30.956
Absolutely.

42:31.176 --> 42:34.545
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

42:34.763 --> 42:37.301
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

42:37.516 --> 42:42.261
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

42:43.564 --> 42:47.644
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

43:14.386 --> 43:15.714
Hey.

43:16.722 --> 43:19.213
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys in.

43:19.433 --> 43:22.849
- I hope that's okay.
- Absolutely.

43:32.237 --> 43:34.396
So you bought a bed.

43:35.866 --> 43:36.981
Yeah.

43:37.576 --> 43:39.284
What is that, a king?

43:41.788 --> 43:43.366
Pillow top?

44:19.576 --> 44:23.491
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

44:28.460 --> 44:29.954
You mind?

44:34.049 --> 44:36.255
I was terrible at chemistry.

44:36.468 --> 44:39.090
I'm more of a humanities guy.

44:39.304 --> 44:41.878
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.

44:42.099 --> 44:46.428
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

44:46.645 --> 44:48.270
My Pl charged me for three hours...

44:48.480 --> 44:51.434
...so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

44:54.361 --> 44:57.481
So this is, what, blackmail?

44:57.698 --> 44:59.406
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

44:59.616 --> 45:04.029
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

45:04.246 --> 45:06.784
I'm not in the shakedown racket.

45:06.999 --> 45:09.406
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

45:09.626 --> 45:12.746
Especially drug dealers.

45:13.172 --> 45:17.216
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

45:17.759 --> 45:21.045
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

45:22.347 --> 45:24.305
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

45:24.516 --> 45:28.810
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar
buried in the side yard?

45:29.021 --> 45:31.975
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up...

45:32.191 --> 45:33.471
...but he won't be the last.

45:33.692 --> 45:37.227
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

45:37.446 --> 45:38.857
I don't understand.

45:39.072 --> 45:41.943
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

45:43.452 --> 45:46.488
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

45:46.914 --> 45:49.998
I'm no Vito Corleone.

45:50.209 --> 45:52.960
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

45:53.170 --> 45:54.664
But with some sound advice...

45:54.880 --> 45:57.252
...and the proper introductions,
who knows?

45:57.466 --> 45:59.423
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

45:59.635 --> 46:02.386
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

46:02.596 --> 46:04.256
...you're on to something special.

46:04.473 --> 46:08.850
