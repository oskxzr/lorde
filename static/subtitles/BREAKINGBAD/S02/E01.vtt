01:46.773 --> 01:50.308
What is this? It's blue.

01:51.195 --> 01:55.406
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.700
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.371
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

02:09.796 --> 02:13.379
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.434
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.397
Just remember
who you're working for.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.896
What did you say?

02:34.112 --> 02:36.900
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.691
Like they don't already know that?

02:40.619 --> 02:43.573
Are you saying that they're stupid?

02:44.373 --> 02:46.911
No, I'm just saying.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.747
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

02:49.962 --> 02:52.583
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

02:52.798 --> 02:54.209
Is that it?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.417
Is that what you're doing?

02:56.635 --> 02:59.802
Tuco. Tuco.

03:01.223 --> 03:05.268
Hey, why don't we all
just relax, huh?

03:12.276 --> 03:14.434
Heisenberg says relax.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.440
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela...

03:32.671 --> 03:35.292
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

03:38.510 --> 03:39.589
Yeah, that's messed up.

03:42.014 --> 03:46.343
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.563
Adjusting for inflation...

04:41.782 --> 04:44.487
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation...

04:44.701 --> 04:46.196
...say, $45,000 a year.

04:46.411 --> 04:52.366
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

04:52.584 --> 04:56.582
Remaining mortgage on the home,
107,000.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.877
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.877
Cost of living, food, clothing,
utilities...

05:05.764 --> 05:07.175
...say, 2 grand a month.

05:07.391 --> 05:10.890
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

05:11.103 --> 05:16.939
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

05:17.150 --> 05:22.655
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.732
Seven thirty-seven.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.913
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.454
That is what I need.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.045
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.090
That's only 10 and half more weeks.
Call it 11.

05:41.300 --> 05:45.796
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

05:47.639 --> 05:51.174
It's doable. Definitely doable.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.621
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.426
Heisenberg!

06:41.318 --> 06:43.987
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.394
What's the matter with you?

06:46.615 --> 06:49.948
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.820
- Oh, damn, Tuco.
- Shut up!

06:53.288 --> 06:55.328
There's no pulse.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.996
- Do something.
- Do something?

06:58.210 --> 07:00.535
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.126
Do something! You're smart, right?

07:03.340 --> 07:04.668
Do that... Do that thing.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.179
No, there's not... There's nothing.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.801
Breathe into his mouth.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.305
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

07:15.519 --> 07:19.184
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.895
No.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.223
Get rid of him.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.561
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.565
Buzzards and rats and all that.

08:07.779 --> 08:11.611
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.744
That sounds like arguing.

08:48.529 --> 08:52.028
Gonzo, hurry up.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.799
What's the big hurry?

09:18.350 --> 09:22.430
Oh, I... I just think we're done here.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.520
Oh, yeah?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.154
You're done.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.866
Hey, I'm back here.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.833
Hello?

11:24.101 --> 11:25.263
Are already married...

11:25.477 --> 11:26.888
Hello?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.933
Thank you to our viewers...

11:32.150 --> 11:34.060
Hey.

11:34.695 --> 11:38.111
The crash happened
as rush hour began around 8 a.m.

11:39.408 --> 11:40.985
Walt?

11:43.245 --> 11:44.276
Didn't you hear me?

11:46.290 --> 11:47.321
Walt.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.671
Walt.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.040
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.502
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

12:04.474 --> 12:06.348
Are you okay?

12:08.020 --> 12:09.763
Great.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.313
New hat?

12:17.738 --> 12:19.315
Yeah.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.318
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.362
Do you want me to heat
some up for you?

12:25.579 --> 12:29.446
But they can occasionally adapt
to other local areas...

12:29.666 --> 12:33.166
...like airports, golf courses...

12:48.268 --> 12:50.391
Where've you been?

13:20.676 --> 13:22.300
What is...?

13:27.391 --> 13:28.422
What are you doing?

13:28.976 --> 13:30.684
Okay.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.012
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.224
Let me clean up first, okay?

13:36.441 --> 13:40.439
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so...

13:40.654 --> 13:43.571
Okay. Yeah, just...

13:43.782 --> 13:46.238
Okay. Enough.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.534
Hold up. Stop it.

13:50.789 --> 13:51.868
Stop it!

14:40.464 --> 14:45.624
I know you're scared...

14:46.512 --> 14:51.138
...and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

14:52.184 --> 14:57.178
But you cannot take it out on me.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.061
Hey, I'm home.

16:22.566 --> 16:23.562
Oh, we are dead.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.231
Dead, man.

16:26.445 --> 16:29.018
Ruto or rute
or however the hell you...

16:29.239 --> 16:31.066
- This is conjecture.
- This is conjecture?

16:31.283 --> 16:33.192
- Conjecture isn't helping.
- Conjecture...?

16:33.410 --> 16:36.744
- We need to state the facts.
- Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

16:36.955 --> 16:40.075
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.035
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning...

16:42.252 --> 16:44.577
...I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighbourhood.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.252
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

16:47.466 --> 16:50.004
What is that, conjecture?

16:50.219 --> 16:53.837
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

16:54.056 --> 16:58.468
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

16:58.685 --> 17:01.520
And that way...
That way he just kept staring at us...

17:01.730 --> 17:05.313
...saying, "You're done."

17:05.526 --> 17:06.521
"You're done"?

17:06.735 --> 17:09.356
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

17:09.571 --> 17:12.442
That means
exactly how it sounds, yo.

17:12.658 --> 17:15.231
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.658
Right now, Tuco's thinking,
"Yeah, hey...

17:17.871 --> 17:22.332
...they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

17:23.460 --> 17:27.789
What happens
when he decides "no"?

17:36.807 --> 17:37.838
No.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.810
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

17:51.530 --> 17:53.985
- How would you do it?
- What do you mean, how?

17:54.199 --> 17:57.699
Specifically, how would you do it?
Step by step.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.912
All right.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.911
Say we set up one last sale.

18:05.127 --> 18:08.330
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

18:08.547 --> 18:11.750
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

18:11.967 --> 18:16.296
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

18:18.307 --> 18:19.338
So three shots?

18:20.017 --> 18:23.267
- Three shots or, I don't know, two.
- Wait, is it two, or is it three?

18:23.478 --> 18:25.851
- Two would probably work, I guess.
- Okay, two shots.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.523
Two in the chest, in the face?

18:27.733 --> 18:31.184
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

18:33.906 --> 18:36.029
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.281
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...

18:38.493 --> 18:40.533
- ...he's probably coming at you, right?
- Yeah.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.904
- You turn toward him.
- Yeah, just wheel on him...

18:43.123 --> 18:44.950
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.542
How many shots does that take?

18:46.752 --> 18:48.543
- I don't know. Three shots.
- Three shots.

18:48.754 --> 18:51.541
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

18:51.757 --> 18:53.334
Now, is there anyone else there?

18:54.593 --> 18:57.713
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

18:57.930 --> 19:02.556
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.181
All right.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.682
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

19:10.901 --> 19:12.858
At this point, how many shots fired?

19:13.070 --> 19:16.071
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

19:21.078 --> 19:23.035
It's not...

19:32.631 --> 19:35.585
How can you suggest
that we kill a man...

19:35.801 --> 19:38.422
...and you can't even open the gun?

19:41.306 --> 19:45.933
- It's not that easy, is it?
- Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.892
Yeah.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.782
Call Skyler.

20:15.591 --> 20:18.592
Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.

20:18.802 --> 20:22.301
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.886
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already?

20:25.100 --> 20:27.674
The big lug and I are gonna go try
that new restaurant...

20:27.895 --> 20:29.353
...over by UNM tonight...

20:29.563 --> 20:32.054
...so let me know
if you guys wanna hang.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.350
Listen to me. "Hang."

20:34.568 --> 20:37.853
Walt Jr. will be proud.
I know the lingo.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.649
I'm still hip.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.939
It's Chinese. The restaurant.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.030
I don't know,
I just feel like Chinese.

20:46.246 --> 20:51.407
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

20:51.627 --> 20:56.621
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes...

20:56.840 --> 20:59.510
...with mashed potatoes
and meat loaf...

20:59.718 --> 21:04.427
...and try and figure out how
to use the little knives and forks?

21:04.640 --> 21:07.131
I wonder if that ever happens.

21:07.351 --> 21:10.885
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.395
Skyler didn't pick up?

21:15.234 --> 21:17.807
Obviously she's not home.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.908
Baby. Baby, wait up.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.410
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

21:30.624 --> 21:32.581
Dinner tonight. That new place.

21:32.793 --> 21:36.577
- How late they serve?
- I don't know.

21:36.797 --> 21:38.671
You got Dave at 8.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.929
- Not tonight.
- Yeah, you do. Remember?

21:44.137 --> 21:45.715
No, that's Thursday.

21:46.807 --> 21:50.390
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's Thursday.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.891
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

21:53.105 --> 21:55.726
They were gonna charge us
a penalty.

21:55.941 --> 21:58.017
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

21:58.235 --> 21:59.350
And I'm doing them, Hank.

21:59.570 --> 22:02.487
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

22:02.698 --> 22:05.901
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

22:06.118 --> 22:08.276
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

22:17.754 --> 22:20.921
Look, it's... You know, it's just...

22:21.133 --> 22:22.793
Oh, boy. I...

22:23.010 --> 22:28.252
I think Dave is really helping you.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.850
Yeah.

22:33.770 --> 22:34.802
Yeah.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.109
Sorry about that.

22:57.878 --> 22:59.954
She's...

23:05.511 --> 23:08.926
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

23:10.724 --> 23:13.642
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest...

23:13.852 --> 23:16.390
- ...and then he says, "Give me a four."
- Hey, Gomez.

23:16.605 --> 23:19.143
Gomez? What do you got for me?

23:19.358 --> 23:21.350
Come on. Chop-chop.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.976
Good morning to you too.

23:27.533 --> 23:30.818
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

23:31.036 --> 23:33.990
- You know Southwest Aniline, right?
- Yeah, off the 25?

23:34.206 --> 23:35.404
The place smells like feet.

23:35.624 --> 23:37.866
This is them. Check this out.

23:40.087 --> 23:44.749
- Holy shit. What was that?
- Thermite. So they tell me.

23:44.967 --> 23:46.710
Burns about 5000 degrees.

23:46.927 --> 23:48.920
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

23:49.137 --> 23:52.803
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

23:56.186 --> 23:58.060
Wait. I take that back.

23:59.565 --> 24:02.056
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

24:02.276 --> 24:06.024
Hey, try rolling it, morons.
It's a barrel.

24:06.238 --> 24:08.029
It rolls. Jesus.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.191
- So, what'd they get?
- Methylamine, 30 gallons.

24:14.580 --> 24:16.572
P2P?

24:16.790 --> 24:19.661
They're cooking
old school biker meth.

24:20.252 --> 24:21.532
Who the hell still does that?

24:21.753 --> 24:24.541
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.292
Pseudo's in short supply...

24:27.509 --> 24:31.044
...so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

24:31.263 --> 24:33.836
That and the thermite...

24:34.057 --> 24:36.216
...I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

24:36.435 --> 24:39.104
- But ranking them as burglars?
- Shit.

24:39.313 --> 24:42.148
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

24:42.357 --> 24:45.607
They got book learning
but no street skills.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.194
Maybe they're college kids.

24:47.404 --> 24:49.231
Chem students
trying to make a big score.

24:49.448 --> 24:51.654
Yeah, maybe.

24:51.867 --> 24:54.440
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor...

24:54.661 --> 24:57.746
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

24:59.249 --> 25:02.452
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them...

25:02.669 --> 25:05.421
...and not those boys from Juarez.

26:31.008 --> 26:33.795
Your daughter wants out.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.541
Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.

27:06.752 --> 27:09.373
We can't come to the phone,
so please leave us a message.

27:11.798 --> 27:12.878
Hey, it's me.

27:13.091 --> 27:14.586
Thought I'd try you earlier...

27:14.801 --> 27:18.420
...before you go out
and, you know, face the day.

27:18.639 --> 27:19.884
I'm realizing now...

27:20.098 --> 27:23.099
...it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone...

27:23.310 --> 27:26.596
...owing to the extra baby weight...

27:28.649 --> 27:30.226
Hey, sweetie.

27:36.031 --> 27:38.736
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

27:39.785 --> 27:41.493
No.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.906
No, no. Well, not all of it.

27:45.958 --> 27:50.833
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of...
My stomach, you know.

27:51.046 --> 27:55.044
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

28:22.703 --> 28:25.538
- How would he know where I live?
- You sure it was Tuco?

28:25.747 --> 28:26.827
Who else could it be?

28:27.040 --> 28:29.080
- Did you ever tell him my name?
- No.

28:29.293 --> 28:31.250
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

28:31.461 --> 28:33.335
- No.
- What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

28:33.547 --> 28:35.705
- Did you tell them anything?
- I didn't say jack.

28:35.924 --> 28:39.459
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

28:39.678 --> 28:43.806
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

28:46.351 --> 28:51.263
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

28:51.481 --> 28:53.439
Oh, God. What happens then?

29:00.616 --> 29:02.822
Look, it's got five bullets.

29:03.035 --> 29:07.447
I finally figured out how to...
Look, I just finally... I figured it out.

29:07.664 --> 29:10.238
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

29:10.459 --> 29:14.373
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

29:14.588 --> 29:16.331
I mean, mathematically.

29:18.509 --> 29:19.707
I've got a better idea.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.843
Thank God.

29:24.056 --> 29:25.431
All right.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.966
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

29:30.312 --> 29:33.313
- Beans.
- Beans?

29:34.066 --> 29:36.853
They're castor beans.

29:37.069 --> 29:38.693
So, what are we gonna do
with them?

29:39.905 --> 29:42.396
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk?

29:42.616 --> 29:44.194
Climb it and escape?

29:45.452 --> 29:47.860
We are going to process them
into ricin.

29:49.248 --> 29:50.706
Rice and beans?

29:52.918 --> 29:55.872
Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.372
It's toxic in small doses.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.046
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

30:01.927 --> 30:04.050
All right.

30:04.263 --> 30:07.050
- All right. So...
- Don't touch them.

30:08.267 --> 30:11.386
- You can get poisoned from beans?
- Yes.

30:11.603 --> 30:16.099
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

30:17.818 --> 30:19.941
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella...

30:20.153 --> 30:22.230
...to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

30:22.447 --> 30:25.863
And we're talking about an amount
not bigger than the head of a pin.

30:27.035 --> 30:29.443
But it... It killed him?

30:29.663 --> 30:31.572
Oh, yes.

30:33.584 --> 30:36.253
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery device...

30:36.461 --> 30:41.420
...and then no more Tuco.

31:21.673 --> 31:25.042
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey, Hank.

31:25.469 --> 31:27.296
How you doing?

31:27.513 --> 31:30.467
Is this... This a bad time?

31:33.018 --> 31:35.176
No, come on in.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.942
I should've called first. I'm sorry.

31:47.783 --> 31:49.859
What can I do for you?

31:52.621 --> 31:55.990
Maybe we ought...

31:56.208 --> 31:58.165
You wanna sit down first?

31:58.836 --> 31:59.915
I don't know, Hank.

32:00.128 --> 32:03.295
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

32:06.718 --> 32:10.502
- Did she send you?
- Hell, no.

32:10.722 --> 32:13.296
She's barely even talking to me.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.344
That's why I'm here, okay?

32:15.561 --> 32:19.641
Self-preservation. Big time.

32:22.943 --> 32:24.567
Look...

32:25.153 --> 32:27.360
...I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

32:27.573 --> 32:29.031
- I get it.
- Gals.

32:29.241 --> 32:32.526
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

32:34.079 --> 32:37.744
But if you could do me this huge favour
and just return her phone calls.

32:38.333 --> 32:42.711
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

32:42.921 --> 32:46.789
Communication. Communication,
right? Back and forth. Come on.

32:47.009 --> 32:50.425
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

32:50.637 --> 32:52.926
Just call her back.

32:58.854 --> 33:00.893
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

33:02.816 --> 33:04.191
That's right.

33:05.152 --> 33:08.319
That baby tiara
she gave me at the shower?

33:08.530 --> 33:11.780
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

33:11.992 --> 33:15.326
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

33:15.537 --> 33:19.998
And Marie won't admit it.
She won't apologise.

33:21.043 --> 33:22.074
Yeah.

33:22.294 --> 33:27.715
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know...

33:34.932 --> 33:36.094
You knew about this.

33:37.142 --> 33:39.633
We're working on it.

33:39.853 --> 33:42.938
I mean,
she's got this therapist, Dave.

33:43.148 --> 33:46.066
- And I mean, Dave is really good.
- Dave's good, yeah.

33:46.276 --> 33:48.898
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...

33:49.112 --> 33:52.778
...and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

33:52.991 --> 33:54.450
I mean, we gotta, you know.

33:54.660 --> 33:58.325
We gotta support the shit out of her.

34:00.290 --> 34:01.322
Do we?

34:01.542 --> 34:02.917
Yeah.

34:04.586 --> 34:06.080
I need support.

34:07.506 --> 34:09.083
Me.

34:09.299 --> 34:11.292
The almost-40-year-old
pregnant woman...

34:11.510 --> 34:13.301
...with the surprise baby on the way.

34:13.971 --> 34:15.679
And the husband
with the lung cancer...

34:15.889 --> 34:18.641
...who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

34:18.851 --> 34:20.808
And he barely
even speaks to me anymore.

34:21.395 --> 34:24.016
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

34:24.231 --> 34:25.974
And the overdrawn
checking account.

34:26.191 --> 34:29.726
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap...

34:29.945 --> 34:32.650
...and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet...

34:32.865 --> 34:34.987
...and we can't even afford to fix it.

34:35.200 --> 34:38.154
But, oh, I see.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.991
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please...

34:41.206 --> 34:43.697
...what can I possibly do
to further benefit...

34:43.917 --> 34:46.669
...my spoiled, kleptomaniac,
bitch sister...

34:46.879 --> 34:49.796
...who somehow always manages
to be the center of attention?"

34:50.007 --> 34:55.962
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

35:11.528 --> 35:14.529
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

35:46.772 --> 35:48.599
That's all it takes?

35:49.983 --> 35:52.355
That's all it takes.

35:53.278 --> 35:56.065
So now what?

35:56.740 --> 35:59.409
Now we arrange our next meet.

35:59.618 --> 36:01.943
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

36:02.162 --> 36:04.202
Business as usual.

36:04.414 --> 36:08.080
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

36:10.712 --> 36:14.580
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
formula we've been working on.

36:14.800 --> 36:15.914
Care to try it?"

36:17.177 --> 36:18.921
Okay, well, what's new about it?

36:20.138 --> 36:22.297
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

36:22.516 --> 36:24.058
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

36:24.810 --> 36:27.764
It gets the user insanely high.

36:27.980 --> 36:30.387
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

36:30.607 --> 36:34.059
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

36:34.278 --> 36:37.444
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

36:38.407 --> 36:43.828
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72...

36:44.037 --> 36:46.611
...it'll look like natural causes.

36:46.832 --> 36:50.877
- What, like a heart attack?
- Yeah.

36:51.086 --> 36:52.995
Or the flu, maybe.

36:53.213 --> 36:56.048
His associates won't know
any differently...

36:56.800 --> 36:59.125
...and we'll be in the clear.

36:59.344 --> 37:02.298
Not if Tuco kills us first.

37:19.656 --> 37:21.696
Just keep it down.

37:21.909 --> 37:24.032
Hey, Hank. What's up?

37:24.244 --> 37:25.822
Oh, hey, buddy.

37:28.749 --> 37:29.780
You been home yet?

37:31.335 --> 37:33.660
No. Why?

37:33.879 --> 37:35.207
Well...

37:37.424 --> 37:38.799
Because I really screwed up.

37:39.009 --> 37:42.093
I apologise in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.

37:42.304 --> 37:45.056
I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.

37:45.265 --> 37:50.508
- I should have just kept out of it.
- Yeah, well, okay.

37:50.729 --> 37:52.307
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

37:52.523 --> 37:56.188
Yeah, well, that... You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

37:56.401 --> 37:58.975
Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.

37:59.613 --> 38:02.104
Jesus, the wives, huh?

38:02.324 --> 38:04.696
Hank, unfortunately, I really...

38:04.910 --> 38:08.409
Oh, yeah.
Hey, man, don't let me keep you.

38:08.622 --> 38:13.450
Actually, I'm at work, so... Oh, hey.

38:13.669 --> 38:15.377
You wanna see something
really freaky?

38:15.587 --> 38:18.873
- Well, I would, but...
- Seriously, Walt, this is...

38:20.092 --> 38:24.220
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

38:28.475 --> 38:29.554
Hank.

38:29.768 --> 38:31.891
Hang on. It should be
coming through right now.

38:34.439 --> 38:38.389
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

38:41.029 --> 38:43.105
Couple of local bulletheads.

38:43.323 --> 38:46.277
Guess they pissed off
the wrong guy.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.869
Walt, you there?

38:53.292 --> 38:54.702
Hey, Walt?

38:59.882 --> 39:02.551
- I'm taking this.
- No. It's my gun. I need it!

39:02.759 --> 39:05.333
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

39:05.554 --> 39:08.674
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've...

39:08.891 --> 39:12.260
I've gotta get home. My family.

39:53.519 --> 39:55.428
Skyler?

40:01.318 --> 40:03.476
Walter, Jr.?

40:09.910 --> 40:11.819
Skyler?

40:56.999 --> 40:58.707
Hey.

41:00.252 --> 41:01.876
Where's Walter, Jr.?

41:02.087 --> 41:05.752
Having dinner at Louis' house.
Supposedly.

41:07.926 --> 41:12.387
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

41:15.767 --> 41:18.638
So where have you been this time?

41:25.903 --> 41:28.026
Walt?

41:41.293 --> 41:43.167
Walt?

41:59.520 --> 42:03.600
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

42:13.033 --> 42:14.907
Walt!

42:16.161 --> 42:18.533
I'll be right there.

42:27.673 --> 42:29.831
Yeah, I recognise
these two knobjobs.

42:30.050 --> 42:32.458
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit...

42:32.678 --> 42:33.923
...named Tuco Salamanca.

42:34.137 --> 42:36.675
- Guess he got tired of associating.
- Yeah.

42:36.890 --> 42:39.512
- Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
- No, go ahead.

42:39.726 --> 42:41.968
Thanks.

42:46.441 --> 42:47.640
The big one smells fresher.

42:49.611 --> 42:50.856
You guys find a death wound?

42:54.032 --> 42:58.694
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

43:01.164 --> 43:02.659
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

43:03.876 --> 43:05.453
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

43:06.461 --> 43:08.834
Let me get out of your way here,
man.

43:21.226 --> 43:22.602
Snap.

43:22.811 --> 43:25.646
Damn, Ricky.
Leave something for the coroner.

43:35.490 --> 43:37.697
Oh, this is beautiful.

43:38.702 --> 43:40.695
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

43:40.913 --> 43:42.621
We got the world's
dumbest criminal.

43:42.831 --> 43:45.239
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

43:45.459 --> 43:49.409
Big stuff here
was moving this guy's body...

43:49.630 --> 43:52.963
...when the stack must have shifted.

43:53.175 --> 43:57.588
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

43:57.804 --> 44:02.383
- Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
- Don't you just?

44:02.601 --> 44:04.724
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

44:04.937 --> 44:08.187
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

44:13.737 --> 44:18.233
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

44:25.999 --> 44:28.537
I don't know where to begin.

45:23.223 --> 45:24.801
What the hell are you doing here?

45:31.982 --> 45:33.013
Get in.

45:45.287 --> 45:48.158
Get in.

46:03.222 --> 46:05.095
Let's go.
