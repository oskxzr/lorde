02:29.942 --> 02:32.610
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.362
Here at the end of round one...

02:34.530 --> 02:36.823
...I'm gonna recommend
cautious optimism.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.159
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded...

02:40.327 --> 02:43.204
...reassess and decide our next move,
if any.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.165
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.210
Yeah.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.337
Well, try to think of this
as good timing.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.090
You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself.

02:54.258 --> 02:56.175
And your hair should start
to come back.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.888
Kind of gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

03:01.056 --> 03:05.434
- I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
- Right. Aerodynamic.

03:05.602 --> 03:10.022
So no more confusion?

03:10.190 --> 03:14.735
- No more...?
- No. No. Absolutely none.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.363
How are you two holding up?

03:19.616 --> 03:20.658
Fine.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.995
I mean, you know, we're busy...

03:24.162 --> 03:26.873
...but we're good. Absolutely.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.876
It's all good.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.842
So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

03:38.010 --> 03:39.927
Yes. Direct bill.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.597
Just need to print it out for you.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.625
Thank you.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.803
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.640
Absolutely. It's included.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.643
Just a reminder.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.605
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.107
Oh, yeah.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.817
Okay.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.821
Congratulations.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.824
Thank you.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.631
Okay, well,
then what about the MRI?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.883
Can you...?
Can you please explain to me...

05:01.051 --> 05:05.304
...the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

05:08.517 --> 05:11.686
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.524
Okay, you know,
it should be covered.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.527
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

05:19.695 --> 05:24.198
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.409
Yeah. Okay.

05:27.703 --> 05:29.203
Bitch.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.080
Hi.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.710
Been around someone who smokes?

05:35.877 --> 05:37.169
No.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.380
The hospital bill came.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.549
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

05:41.717 --> 05:45.845
Three-day stay,
13,000 and counting.

05:52.060 --> 05:56.814
Is this something that
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

05:58.316 --> 05:59.734
I mean...

05:59.901 --> 06:04.071
...I know it's strictly your domain,
but...

06:04.239 --> 06:06.365
They will. I'm sure they will.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.200
I'll handle it.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.025
Oh, God.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.112
Bring me up to speed on
Tuco Salamanca.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.363
- Dead.
- Still?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.782
- Completely.
- Okay, then.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.535
- Well, thanks for stopping by.
- Okay.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.707
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.251
- Good.
- Of course, that's not gonna last.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.421
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.048
No takers so far?

09:09.216 --> 09:12.593
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Heisenberg.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.221
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.723
- Heisenberg?
- Yeah, I know.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.601
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.939
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.608
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.196
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

09:32.948 --> 09:38.786
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

09:38.954 --> 09:41.497
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles...

09:41.665 --> 09:43.791
...in pursuit of their prey.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.960
Yeah, I think I heard that.

09:47.462 --> 09:50.130
You, my friend, are a great white.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.259
How does Albuquerque liaison...

09:53.426 --> 09:56.804
...Tri-State Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.139
Like one hell of a promotion.

09:59.307 --> 10:03.018
As of the 1 st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.646
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.898
What you gonna do without me,
Gomey?

10:08.066 --> 10:11.694
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.697
Hey, buddy,
I am the brains and the brawn.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.324
- I'm the whole package.
- I'm glad I didn't just eat.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.994
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.871
- You wanna grab lunch?
- Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.833
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.002
Try not to get lost on the way.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.212
Schrader.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.547
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.383
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked too.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.260
Yeah, El Paso.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.805
Here's the man.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.019
- Hey, congratulations, Hank.
- Thanks.

11:45.830 --> 11:50.084
Gets two in the sand,
two in the forest, you know?

11:50.251 --> 11:53.504
And then he says,
"Give me a four," you know?

11:53.671 --> 11:55.339
Hey. Hey.

12:27.664 --> 12:31.166
- Hey.
- Got some nerve coming back here.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.293
Or you're even dumber
than I thought.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.629
Yeah, well, maybe both.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.807
Balance for the tow, the repairs...

12:46.975 --> 12:51.812
...and extra for damages and stuff,
the gate...

12:51.980 --> 12:54.815
...the toilet.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.360
Look, like I said...

12:58.528 --> 13:01.447
...my word is my bond.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.964
What would you charge me
to store this here?

13:19.132 --> 13:22.092
- A million-five.
- Come on, yo.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.511
- Your sister.
- Dog, I'm serious, all right?

13:24.679 --> 13:29.349
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.977
We could, you know, negotiate.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.484
Five hundred.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.985
- A month?
- A week.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.947
For real?

13:44.115 --> 13:45.782
- See you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.202
Just hold on. Just chill.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.915
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.209
- Outside.
- Inside.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.044
- Forget it.
- Man, come on.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.297
Your fence is too easy to climb.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.050
Inside, padlocked,
plus gate privileges.

14:03.218 --> 14:07.221
- Come again?
- Gate, in and out, privileges.

14:08.389 --> 14:12.142
Month to month. Cash up front.
Inside.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.895
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.396
Yeah.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.036
You selling?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.163
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.048
What about that one?

14:46.928 --> 14:48.512
Serious?

15:10.118 --> 15:12.869
It's Jane, right?

15:13.037 --> 15:16.540
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

15:16.708 --> 15:20.752
- Really? Does it inspire awe?
- No. I mean, you know, it's great.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.380
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

15:23.548 --> 15:26.466
I had an entire house before,
detached and all...

15:26.634 --> 15:31.013
...but I was just tired of the lawn care,
upkeep and whatnot. You know?

15:31.180 --> 15:34.224
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.144
Jesus.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.773
Utilities are included.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.775
Stacking. Sweet.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.695
- You got cable?
- Already wired. Just call to activate.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.530
High speed, whatever.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.408
Bathroom, cool tile.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.452
Bedroom.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.786
Nice.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.165
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.628
- So you're interested?
- Definitely. Definitely, yeah.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.796
And you're good with NP, NS?

16:07.425 --> 16:08.550
Sorry. What?

16:08.718 --> 16:11.928
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
You wanna smoke, you do it outside.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.057
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

16:15.224 --> 16:19.353
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a W-2
or recent pay stub, current employer...

16:19.520 --> 16:22.147
...former address, you know,
the yadda yadda.

16:22.315 --> 16:26.026
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.863
Yeah. Look...

16:30.031 --> 16:31.531
...the thing is...

16:31.699 --> 16:33.367
...I can...

16:33.534 --> 16:35.035
Unbelievable.

16:35.203 --> 16:38.872
- I'm just currently between situations.
- Then I'm currently not renting.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.709
Look, look, I got the money and
I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.

16:42.877 --> 16:46.380
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

16:46.547 --> 16:49.174
Yo, my dad's not really
a make-exceptions kind of guy.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.551
- Trust me.
- Your dad?

16:51.719 --> 16:54.554
Owns the place. I manage it.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.973
Pen on paper. That's what I need.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.892
Or go run your game
somewhere else.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.311
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This is it.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.897
And I got no game, all right?

17:04.065 --> 17:06.733
I just need a chance.

17:09.904 --> 17:13.365
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.535
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.621
Didn't meet their expectations again.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.624
So you know, now
I'm persona non gratis or whatever.

17:22.792 --> 17:26.962
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.589
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.759
I will not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

17:41.769 --> 17:42.936
Rent just went up.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.939
A hundred more a month.
That's the cash price.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.691
Yes.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.943
Okay. Yes.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.863
Hey, you rock. Thank you.
Thank you. You won't regret this.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.782
And in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.452
DBAA fee, nonrefundable.

17:58.619 --> 18:03.206
Yeah, of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously, yeah.

18:05.126 --> 18:09.129
All right. So, what's DBAA?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.673
- Don't be an asshole.
- Gotcha.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.426
- I live next door.
- Really?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.971
Don't think for one second you have
squatter's rights, because you don't.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.723
If you blow this, I want you gone.

18:19.891 --> 18:23.018
I know guys that'll have your skinny
ass out back by the Dumpster...

18:23.186 --> 18:24.603
...faster than you can blink.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.149
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.650
Which is what, by the way?

18:30.818 --> 18:33.153
It's Jesse.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.157
Jesse Jackson.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.326
Seriously?

18:40.995 --> 18:42.204
What?

19:31.212 --> 19:33.839
- What are you doing?
- Beating off. What's it look like?

19:34.006 --> 19:37.509
That is in fact exactly
what it looks like to me.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.804
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

19:40.972 --> 19:44.015
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.393
So let me get this straight.

19:46.561 --> 19:51.189
You call in sick the day after
receiving a long-awaited...

19:51.357 --> 19:53.733
...career-boosting promotion...

19:53.901 --> 19:58.238
...so you can play Oktoberfest
in your man cave?

19:59.073 --> 20:00.824
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.993
Babe, relax.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.538
- Please, don't tell me to relax.
- Sorry, I forgot.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.748
- You know I hate that.
- Right.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.709
Dave said I should express that.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.628
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.172
I can take a day.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.091
No big deal.

20:18.259 --> 20:24.306
Now get that sweet ass out of here
so I can concentrate.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.873
<i>Okay, so, what's the plan?</i>

22:14.041 --> 22:16.376
The plan is we cook.

22:16.544 --> 22:21.006
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

22:30.975 --> 22:33.601
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

22:33.769 --> 22:36.521
Say if I cook during the days
and you work the nights.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.523
- Dude.
- What?

22:39.233 --> 22:41.568
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't it?

22:41.736 --> 22:45.196
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before...

22:45.364 --> 22:48.616
- ...but still, what choice do we have?
- First of all, there's no we.

22:48.784 --> 22:52.912
Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.330
I got profile now.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.751
Don't you get that?
DEA's up my ass.

22:57.918 --> 23:01.337
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.090
- No way.
- Then what do you suggest?

23:04.258 --> 23:09.179
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.603
I got bills, man.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.104
You've got bills?

23:18.272 --> 23:20.148
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.150
I've already lost more than
I've made...

23:22.318 --> 23:25.028
...and I am tired
of dicking around out here.

23:25.196 --> 23:28.281
You wanna know how much
I've got left?

23:28.449 --> 23:30.575
After completing
my first round of treatment...

23:30.743 --> 23:34.287
...and financing
the world's most expensive alibi?

23:34.455 --> 23:36.456
Zero. Zip. Nothing.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.751
I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family...

23:39.919 --> 23:43.379
...which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.887
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option...

23:51.055 --> 23:54.140
...that leaves us with a total
of two choices:

23:54.308 --> 23:57.393
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic...

23:57.561 --> 23:59.646
...or you and I start...

23:59.814 --> 24:03.608
You selling whatever you can.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.613
There's a third way.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.991
And what would that be?

24:13.828 --> 24:16.913
We got to be Tuco.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.499
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

24:19.667 --> 24:23.545
So you're going to what?

24:23.712 --> 24:25.922
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

24:26.090 --> 24:29.175
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

24:29.343 --> 24:33.930
Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

24:34.098 --> 24:38.017
Look, we control production
and distribution.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.437
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.691
I mean, the point here is
to make money, right?

24:44.859 --> 24:46.192
Sky-high stacks.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.029
- No.
- No? That's not the point?

24:50.197 --> 24:52.824
No, I am not willing to do that.

24:53.701 --> 24:55.660
Who said anything about you?

24:58.789 --> 25:00.832
I don't vote for this plan.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.211
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown entities into our operation.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.964
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.719
I beg your pardon?

25:12.887 --> 25:16.723
- This is a partnership, remember?
- I rem... Oh, I remember.

25:16.891 --> 25:19.058
Yeah, you cook, I sell.

25:19.226 --> 25:22.562
That was the division of labor
when we started all this.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.939
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.984
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk...

25:28.152 --> 25:30.403
...or on my knees
with a gun to my head...

25:30.571 --> 25:33.573
...before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

25:40.539 --> 25:43.917
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

25:44.418 --> 25:47.045
And perhaps
I was overly ambitious.

25:47.838 --> 25:50.298
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.175
Yeah, damn straight.

25:52.343 --> 25:54.385
Know why?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.388
Because we do things
my way this time...

25:57.556 --> 25:59.432
...or I walk.

26:02.895 --> 26:07.273
You need me more than
I need you, Walt.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.964
Yo, enter my casa.
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?

26:31.131 --> 26:32.173
What up with it, yo?

26:32.341 --> 26:35.635
Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

26:35.803 --> 26:38.596
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

26:39.556 --> 26:43.810
- Yo, Badge, hey.
- Cool crib, man.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.645
Hey, it echoes.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.480
Hello.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.649
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.567
Let me give you the virtual tour,
okay?

26:51.735 --> 26:54.320
So plasma is gonna go right here.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.572
Probably like 50-inch,
you know, wall-mounted.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.992
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.868
No. They burn in, yo.

27:01.036 --> 27:04.205
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

27:04.373 --> 27:07.000
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.876
That's what I'm waiting for.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.296
- Porn, coz. You know?
- Jesus.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.007
Like 3-D tatas,
like right in your face.

27:14.174 --> 27:17.093
Yeah. So I'm gonna get a couple
of those zero-gravity chairs...

27:17.261 --> 27:20.138
...for, like, right here,
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.472
Those are buck.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.684
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.020
- Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
- Yeah.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.439
I'm thinking, you know,
just a bunch of candles...

27:29.606 --> 27:32.066
...maybe one of those
little fountain jobs right here.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.068
- It's gonna be chill.
- The ladies...

27:34.236 --> 27:38.031
...they cream up real nice for,
like, candles and shit.

27:38.907 --> 27:41.367
You are going to score, big time.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.039
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

27:46.206 --> 27:49.375
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

27:49.543 --> 27:53.212
You got any other refreshments?

27:53.380 --> 27:56.299
- I could kick it. It's been a while.
- Yes, yes.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.926
I could totally go
for a loving spoonful.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.387
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

28:01.555 --> 28:05.224
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.061
Okay? So listen up.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.939
This is how it goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

28:12.107 --> 28:16.069
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.030
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.699
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

28:21.867 --> 28:23.409
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

28:23.577 --> 28:27.080
- Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
- Seventeen.

28:27.247 --> 28:31.000
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

28:31.168 --> 28:34.629
All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second...

28:34.797 --> 28:36.923
...who else is selling right now,
huh?

28:37.091 --> 28:40.176
- It's dry out there, that's for sure.
- Church.

28:40.344 --> 28:43.638
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

28:43.806 --> 28:47.016
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.435
Short me, you're out.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.229
Cut it, you're out.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.064
Period.

28:53.232 --> 28:57.193
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

28:57.361 --> 28:58.945
Understand?

28:59.113 --> 29:01.781
Badger, what is this?

29:03.951 --> 29:05.576
A big opportunity.

29:05.744 --> 29:09.247
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.959
Gentlemen,
how far you go is up to you.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.627
So bring out the product, yo.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.588
No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

29:17.756 --> 29:21.759
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

29:23.095 --> 29:27.598
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.600
Now, I got mad volume.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.479
So you move it quick,
you move it right...

29:33.647 --> 29:36.816
...there is always more.

29:38.152 --> 29:41.529
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

29:41.697 --> 29:43.948
Apply yourselves.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.241
Hell, yeah.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.452
Hell, yeah.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.902
Hey, there's the big guy.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.362
- Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
- Hey, Hank.

30:23.530 --> 30:24.739
It's an armpit.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.699
It's not an armpit.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.534
Oh, excuse me.

30:28.702 --> 30:31.287
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.873
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

30:34.041 --> 30:37.460
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

30:37.628 --> 30:39.754
Human heads, they leave.

30:39.922 --> 30:44.050
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

30:44.218 --> 30:46.636
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

30:47.513 --> 30:51.474
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

30:51.642 --> 30:54.560
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

30:54.728 --> 30:57.396
You just do your time
like a good boy...

30:57.564 --> 31:00.566
...and I could see us
in a cute little condo in Georgetown...

31:00.734 --> 31:02.527
...in a couple of years.

31:17.501 --> 31:22.797
I went online to this fantastic...

31:22.965 --> 31:25.925
...real estate website for D.C.

31:26.093 --> 31:30.930
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

31:31.098 --> 31:33.182
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

31:33.350 --> 31:36.435
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.854
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there...

31:44.611 --> 31:46.237
Apologize.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.991
What?

31:50.158 --> 31:56.664
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologize.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.461
- For?
- You know perfectly well, Marie.

32:02.629 --> 32:05.673
- Well, obviously I don't...
- Your lies.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.466
To me.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.012
The shoplifting.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.805
All of it.

32:12.973 --> 32:17.476
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

32:17.644 --> 32:20.771
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it...

32:21.189 --> 32:22.815
Apologize.

32:26.236 --> 32:28.321
Now or never. I mean it.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.990
Or it'll never be the same.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.787
Why are you punishing me?

32:37.748 --> 32:44.086
If you don't respect me enough to
apologize, to tell me the truth, then...

32:53.013 --> 32:55.014
I need my sister back.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.696
I'm sorry.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.035
I'm sorry.

33:25.504 --> 33:30.216
- What do you want, the gory details?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.218
No, you don't.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.303
Keep you up at night.

33:35.222 --> 33:40.184
So was it scary?

33:40.352 --> 33:42.937
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary,
you little punk.

33:43.105 --> 33:44.188
Jesus.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.274
But you were way faster than him.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.860
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

33:50.654 --> 33:52.780
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.323
Kick ass and take names.

33:54.491 --> 33:57.326
- Son.
- No, it's fine.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.371
You know what it is?

34:00.539 --> 34:04.250
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

34:04.418 --> 34:06.377
I mean, you don't think about it.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.255
You stomp them down.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.425
Where do they come from?

34:13.885 --> 34:16.512
Criminals, like the one you...

34:16.680 --> 34:20.433
I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

34:22.269 --> 34:25.104
Buddy, you might as well be
asking me about the roaches.

34:27.190 --> 34:30.526
All I know is there's a whole world
of them out there.

34:33.238 --> 34:36.115
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.040
Cops.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.334
Cops!

37:50.143 --> 37:52.394
Wasn't sure it was you.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.647
New car?

37:54.814 --> 37:58.651
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.

37:58.818 --> 38:01.987
I'm guessing
this one doesn't bounce.

38:09.162 --> 38:11.121
Your half.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.791
Fifteen K.
That's what I'm talking about.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.046
You're welcome.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.297
Jesus.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.969
Help me understand the math,
okay?

38:25.136 --> 38:27.054
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

38:27.222 --> 38:30.182
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.184
$1,000 each.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.311
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

38:34.479 --> 38:39.358
Sixteen ounces should net
to me $16,000.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.528
Sixteen. Not 15.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.531
Something came up.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.367
Something came up?

38:48.535 --> 38:51.662
One of my guys got held up
by a couple junkies.

38:51.830 --> 38:56.458
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

38:58.211 --> 39:01.213
So you're saying
that your guy got robbed...

39:01.381 --> 39:06.760
- Or rather you got robbed.
- But it doesn't matter.

39:07.637 --> 39:10.472
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?

39:10.640 --> 39:12.391
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.560
And you're thinking
this is acceptable?

39:14.728 --> 39:17.855
It's the cost of business, yo.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.523
You're sweating me over a grand?

39:19.691 --> 39:24.153
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
I'm not the street guy, yo.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.613
But it seems to me
that what you call breakage...

39:26.781 --> 39:29.908
...is just you making a fool
of yourself.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.953
I've got another technical
term for you.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.914
Non-sustainable business model.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.375
You're focusing on the negative.

39:38.543 --> 39:42.171
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

39:43.089 --> 39:45.215
What happens when
word gets out...

39:45.383 --> 39:48.844
...and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

39:49.012 --> 39:51.972
Once everyone knows that
Jesse Pinkman...

39:52.140 --> 39:56.268
...drug lord,
can be robbed with impunity.

39:56.436 --> 39:57.770
Man, come on.

39:57.937 --> 40:01.440
You think Tuco had breakage?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.276
I guess it's true, he did.

40:04.444 --> 40:05.611
He broke bones.

40:06.488 --> 40:09.782
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.493
You want another grand?
Is that it?

40:12.660 --> 40:14.953
- That's not my point.
- Take it. Here.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.710
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

40:21.878 --> 40:24.088
Hey, we're making bank.
Shit happens.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.924
My guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.467
So am I.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.386
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.473
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

40:34.641 --> 40:37.559
You've made
the division of labor very clear.

40:38.978 --> 40:42.439
Yo, I mean, seriously...

40:42.607 --> 40:46.151
...what the hell
do you want me to do, huh?

41:13.346 --> 41:14.388
Hey.

41:14.556 --> 41:15.848
Sorry.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.808
Wow, you snuck in.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.102
Didn't even know you were home.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.437
What you eating?

41:22.605 --> 41:25.691
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.610
I thought we nixed those, huh?

41:28.778 --> 41:30.529
Did we?

41:31.573 --> 41:36.201
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

41:37.036 --> 41:38.912
I had a craving.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.290
Once in a while is no big deal.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.006
So where's Jr?

41:49.883 --> 41:51.175
Out.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.720
With whom?

41:54.888 --> 41:56.388
Louis.

42:00.310 --> 42:02.477
Out where?

42:03.938 --> 42:06.899
Somewhere. I don't know.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.902
- He'll be back by 9.
- Okay.

42:11.738 --> 42:15.449
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

42:15.617 --> 42:17.242
Why don't you?

42:18.578 --> 42:22.748
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

42:22.916 --> 42:25.375
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.836
Just pick up the phone like I do.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.974
Great.

42:44.687 --> 42:47.940
Perhaps you might know
something...

42:48.107 --> 42:49.316
...about this.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.238
Perhaps.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.282
And then again...

42:58.284 --> 43:00.535
...perhaps I don't, Walt.

43:00.703 --> 43:04.206
Perhaps I smoked them
in a fugue state.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.294
I'd like an explanation, please.

43:09.462 --> 43:12.381
- You don't wanna go down that road.
- Why would you do this?

43:12.548 --> 43:15.634
- You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
- Three and a half cigarettes...

43:15.802 --> 43:17.302
...won't do a thing to the baby.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.638
- Nothing.
- I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

43:19.806 --> 43:22.432
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

43:22.600 --> 43:28.605
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

43:30.191 --> 43:34.528
Skyler, this...
I mean, this is something that...

43:34.696 --> 43:37.990
- This is so unlike you. Why...?
- Really?

43:38.157 --> 43:40.117
How would you know?

43:42.829 --> 43:44.955
No, thank you.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.144
Hank.

44:35.548 --> 44:36.882
Jesus.

45:19.050 --> 45:20.592
Yo.

45:29.268 --> 45:32.604
You asked me what
I want you to do.

45:42.824 --> 45:45.450
I want you to handle it.
