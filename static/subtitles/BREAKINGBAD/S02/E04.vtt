01:47.816 --> 01:52.727
Hey, Captain America.

01:55.782 --> 01:58.071
- What's up, brother?
- Hey, bro.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.335
This is stupid.

02:17.012 --> 02:21.425
- You got a better idea?
- Okay, fun. Whatever.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.761
- So when do we, you know?
- We don't, for now.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.185
No cooking until things settle down.

02:27.397 --> 02:31.265
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.608
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal...

02:33.820 --> 02:38.281
...that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't...

02:40.077 --> 02:41.073
That's too expensive.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.120
Look, I can't leave my house...

02:53.340 --> 02:55.712
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.753
I need time to mend fences.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.802
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

03:02.015 --> 03:05.634
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.573
That's $600.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.157
Okay, what about the rest?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.823
- Rest of what?
- Half your money's mine.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.245
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.624
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

03:30.836 --> 03:32.793
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.875
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

03:41.180 --> 03:45.509
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

03:46.018 --> 03:49.434
As for now, no contact. Understood?

03:52.024 --> 03:53.019
Where are you going?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.027
I leave first.

04:13.462 --> 04:17.294
- Walt!
- In the kitchen.

04:32.731 --> 04:33.976
Hey.

04:34.733 --> 04:38.316
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.814
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.574
Juice is on the table.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.117
What?

04:51.291 --> 04:54.126
- Good morning, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.874
Dad's cooking breakfast.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.924
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.384
Nice? Follow me.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.597
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice...

05:07.808 --> 05:10.762
...which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

05:10.978 --> 05:15.106
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

05:15.315 --> 05:19.099
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.649
I wanted to.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.826
- Grapefruit juice?
- Yes, please. Thanks.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.576
There you go. Honey?

05:31.790 --> 05:34.115
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

05:35.252 --> 05:39.830
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.584
- Yeah.
- There you go.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.291
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.465
- No.
- Yes, absolutely.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.254
No, in terms of pure musicianship...

05:50.475 --> 05:53.311
...I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.058
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.390
- That's besides the point.
- Have a good day, honey.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.152
You too.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.649
- Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
- Boz Scaggs.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.365
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

06:09.578 --> 06:10.574
- Bye.
- You're welcome.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.365
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

06:12.581 --> 06:13.992
All right.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.287
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.747
We have failed as parents.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.463
Come to think of it...

06:24.676 --> 06:27.298
- ...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
- Stop it.

06:27.513 --> 06:30.679
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.302
Thank you.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.929
Hey, listen...

06:36.146 --> 06:38.353
...in the calendar section...

06:38.941 --> 06:41.017
...all week long...

06:41.735 --> 06:45.567
...there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

06:45.781 --> 06:49.150
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

06:49.368 --> 06:51.859
- ...and that sort of thing.
- Yeah?

06:52.746 --> 06:57.906
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might...

06:58.877 --> 07:00.953
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.508
Oh, and...

07:15.227 --> 07:18.643
...you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.181
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.891
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

07:24.111 --> 07:29.236
...and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

07:31.577 --> 07:35.906
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

07:36.415 --> 07:39.250
...to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

07:40.711 --> 07:43.415
And, well, the weird thing is that...

07:43.630 --> 07:47.414
...the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same...

07:47.634 --> 07:50.754
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

07:50.971 --> 07:54.589
...if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.928
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound...

07:58.145 --> 08:00.434
...other than the phone ring, but...

08:00.814 --> 08:03.815
They so overcomplicate
these things.

08:04.568 --> 08:09.444
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.815
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

08:13.035 --> 08:16.867
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

08:17.080 --> 08:20.117
...we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.171
Skyler?

08:37.392 --> 08:38.472
Skyler?

09:28.569 --> 09:31.486
- Ready?
- Yo, for what, might help.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.208
Not another intervention.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.502
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...

09:54.720 --> 09:57.555
...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...

09:57.764 --> 09:59.722
...of the New Mexico
Real Property Code...

09:59.933 --> 10:01.842
...you are hereby
given notice to vacate...

10:02.060 --> 10:06.603
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

10:06.815 --> 10:10.065
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.685
- It's your aunt Ginny's house.
- And she gave it to me.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.399
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.366
You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.826
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

10:21.038 --> 10:24.738
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.366
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

10:27.586 --> 10:30.255
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.753
No, I'm not. What?

10:32.966 --> 10:36.549
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.051
He came to our front door.

10:42.309 --> 10:46.093
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...

10:46.313 --> 10:50.097
...which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you...

10:50.317 --> 10:52.274
...so you're welcome.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.644
I saw your basement.

10:55.656 --> 10:56.770
Oh, yeah.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.858
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in...

11:01.078 --> 11:05.455
...and I found your laboratory.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.452
You guys have your own key?

11:16.885 --> 11:20.420
Manufacture of a Schedule ll
controlled substance...

11:21.223 --> 11:23.381
...is a second degree felony.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.846
Under federal asset seizure...

11:27.062 --> 11:30.229
...the government can take
the entire house.

11:30.524 --> 11:34.107
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.810
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

11:37.030 --> 11:40.446
...but you will not drag us down
with you.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.619
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.821
Otherwise,
your parents have authorized me...

11:46.039 --> 11:49.455
...to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

11:50.961 --> 11:53.250
Do you have any questions for us?

11:56.633 --> 11:58.341
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.715
Come on.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.971
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:51.688 --> 12:55.556
- I fixed the garage door.
- Great.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.187
Yeah.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.072
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.822
Okay.

13:03.909 --> 13:06.744
- Where were you today?
- Out.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.459
Is everything okay?

13:22.469 --> 13:25.470
Yeah, everything's fine.

13:38.986 --> 13:44.609
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings...

13:44.825 --> 13:46.699
...the cancer support group.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.737
I think that that's good.

13:50.289 --> 13:51.617
Yeah.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.741
Yeah, that's good.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.915
You were right
on the money about that.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.414
It's good to, you know...

14:01.258 --> 14:03.381
...talk about things.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.010
I think that's great.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.725
Yeah.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.081
Jesse.

14:41.381 --> 14:45.165
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.876
You don't answer your phone?

14:49.473 --> 14:51.465
Yeah, no, I've just been...

14:51.683 --> 14:54.305
...pretty busy. How'd you...?

14:54.520 --> 14:58.268
Oh, right, you have that key.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.813
Hey, listen.

15:01.610 --> 15:04.231
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation...

15:04.446 --> 15:08.859
...we had the other day,
and I completely get why...

15:09.076 --> 15:12.409
...Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and...

15:12.621 --> 15:16.322
- It's not just your father, Jesse.
- No, I know. I know. I know.

15:16.542 --> 15:21.749
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me...

15:21.964 --> 15:24.918
...which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been...

15:25.133 --> 15:28.549
...thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.218
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now...

15:31.431 --> 15:34.931
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

15:35.143 --> 15:38.892
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

15:39.106 --> 15:42.439
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.853
Hey. Hey.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.446
What the hell, yo?

15:47.656 --> 15:50.823
- I thought it was just a wake-up call.
- We are putting it in storage.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.241
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.742
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

15:55.956 --> 15:59.076
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

15:59.293 --> 16:02.578
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.041
I earned this.

16:04.256 --> 16:06.581
You did not make
her lunch every day.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.544
What did you do, huh?

16:08.760 --> 16:11.430
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.927
- Don't start with me.
- Now what?

16:14.141 --> 16:17.426
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.887
Great family, Mom.

16:21.440 --> 16:25.023
Why are you like this? Why?

16:34.286 --> 16:39.529
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.573
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.170
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

16:44.379 --> 16:47.464
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

16:48.759 --> 16:50.965
I don't know, sweetheart.

16:52.221 --> 16:57.463
But please turn your life around.

16:58.477 --> 17:02.806
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

17:05.025 --> 17:06.934
Jeez.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.487
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.459
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

17:23.669 --> 17:24.997
Come in and say hello.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.082
Hey, we've got omelettes.
You want an omelette?

17:28.340 --> 17:29.336
No, I'm good.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.504
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chillies.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.593
No. Thank you, though.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.514
Flynn and me gotta get going.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.516
- Who's Flynn?
- Flynn.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.685
He's your...

17:45.357 --> 17:48.726
- Flynn?
- Yeah.

17:48.944 --> 17:50.522
So?

17:51.655 --> 17:53.612
So? Nothing.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.441
- You ready?
- Like it.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.368
- Bye, Mr. White.
- Okay.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.747
Bye.

18:08.130 --> 18:12.080
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

18:16.430 --> 18:20.130
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

18:20.350 --> 18:23.600
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.686
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

18:25.898 --> 18:27.890
Don't take it personally.

18:28.859 --> 18:31.065
He wants his own identity.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.152
You think he told Louis about me?

18:39.369 --> 18:42.821
- About the blackout?
- Louis is his friend, Walt...

18:43.040 --> 18:45.613
...and your disappearance
upset him.

18:49.505 --> 18:53.123
Hey, I made omelettes.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.880
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.637
Where you going?

18:59.097 --> 19:01.220
Can you get the phone, please?

19:02.518 --> 19:06.100
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

19:10.567 --> 19:14.268
- White residence.
- Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?

19:15.113 --> 19:18.648
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

19:18.867 --> 19:21.987
- I know, but there's a problem.
- I don't care. We agreed.

19:22.204 --> 19:25.288
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

19:25.499 --> 19:27.788
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

19:29.336 --> 19:31.874
Yeah, we're happy.

19:33.966 --> 19:35.958
Skyler? Sky?

19:38.637 --> 19:42.302
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

19:42.516 --> 19:43.927
Out.

19:45.185 --> 19:49.017
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

19:49.481 --> 19:51.225
Skyler.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.739
- What?
- Yo, I get I shouldn't call...

19:59.950 --> 20:02.406
...but I'm in a situation here,
and I need my money.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.327
I just gave you $600.

20:04.538 --> 20:05.818
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...

20:06.039 --> 20:08.115
...but that was
before my housing situation...

20:08.333 --> 20:10.456
...went completely
testicular on me, okay?

20:10.669 --> 20:12.662
You smoked the entire 600,
didn't you?

20:12.880 --> 20:14.160
- What? No.
- Yes.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.460
- No.
- Look, Jesse...

20:15.674 --> 20:17.216
...your problems are just that:

20:17.426 --> 20:19.086
Your problems.

20:19.303 --> 20:22.007
No contact. Do not call here ever.

20:22.222 --> 20:26.090
- When the moment is right, I will call.
- Mr. White, you're not listening.

20:26.310 --> 20:28.516
They're kicking me out of my house.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.692
You son of a bitch.

20:46.205 --> 20:48.411
Son of a bitch.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.367
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

20:52.586 --> 20:55.540
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

20:55.756 --> 20:59.374
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

20:59.593 --> 21:02.962
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

21:43.512 --> 21:44.840
Hold on, buddy.

21:45.055 --> 21:48.258
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.598
I know. That sounded tight.

21:50.811 --> 21:52.638
Hey, thanks again, P.

21:52.855 --> 21:56.852
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.182
Two nights tops.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.809
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

22:01.029 --> 22:03.520
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

22:04.074 --> 22:07.075
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.366
Yeah.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.746
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

22:12.958 --> 22:13.954
Too hot.

22:14.168 --> 22:17.204
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

22:17.421 --> 22:18.832
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.538
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

22:21.758 --> 22:23.881
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

22:24.094 --> 22:28.886
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

22:30.017 --> 22:32.305
Damn. I'm hating, man.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.437
That's why we need to get the Hammer
up and running, you know?

22:35.647 --> 22:39.230
- Get you out of the house.
- How awesome would that be?

22:39.443 --> 22:41.103
Come on. Look. What?

22:41.486 --> 22:44.820
I cut all the green parts off like you...
Just eat them. Please?

22:45.032 --> 22:48.614
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

22:48.827 --> 22:49.942
Get back in the scene.

22:50.704 --> 22:52.993
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

22:53.207 --> 22:56.291
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich...

22:56.502 --> 22:58.161
...and then you take...

22:58.921 --> 23:00.960
Mommy's home.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.046
- Hi.
- Hello.

23:04.259 --> 23:06.667
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Pinkman?

23:07.596 --> 23:10.680
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.800
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.509
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

23:17.439 --> 23:20.108
Sure. Yeah.

23:41.839 --> 23:43.712
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.

23:46.969 --> 23:51.761
Hey, Hen, I think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

24:01.191 --> 24:04.525
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

24:04.736 --> 24:09.363
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

24:09.575 --> 24:10.985
You got other people to call?

24:11.201 --> 24:13.573
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

24:13.787 --> 24:15.910
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.581
Yo, in-laws?

24:19.793 --> 24:23.577
- Sucks to be you, P.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

24:24.673 --> 24:26.298
Here.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.919
See you, man.

24:28.135 --> 24:30.127
It's good to see you.

24:32.139 --> 24:35.424
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and...

24:35.642 --> 24:38.596
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

24:38.812 --> 24:41.268
I need a solid here, bro.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.935
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

24:45.652 --> 24:49.104
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

24:49.615 --> 24:52.022
What if it's just for tonight?

25:09.927 --> 25:12.797
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

25:13.013 --> 25:16.097
- You cannot be serious.
- Hey.

25:17.059 --> 25:19.466
Someone took your bike, man.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.679
Not cool.

28:35.299 --> 28:38.668
- Morning.
- Oh, hey.

28:38.886 --> 28:40.261
Morning.

28:40.721 --> 28:43.591
Where did...? Where did Mom go?

28:45.392 --> 28:47.100
Out.

28:53.317 --> 28:55.558
Where's breakfast?

28:59.573 --> 29:00.853
Hey.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.902
Let's go do something.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.780
Like what?

29:07.748 --> 29:09.824
Something fun.

29:11.710 --> 29:14.628
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

29:14.838 --> 29:18.883
- Is your foot on the... Okay. Good.
- Yeah. I got it.

29:22.095 --> 29:23.258
Good.

29:23.472 --> 29:27.090
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

29:27.768 --> 29:30.888
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

29:31.104 --> 29:33.393
Okay, let's slow down here...

29:33.607 --> 29:36.727
...to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

29:36.944 --> 29:39.861
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

29:40.072 --> 29:42.777
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right. You're doing fine.

29:42.991 --> 29:46.906
- Much better than last time, huh?
- Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

29:47.955 --> 29:49.413
Has he?

29:49.623 --> 29:51.948
Good. Good. Okay.

29:52.167 --> 29:54.207
Don't forget the turn indic... Good.

29:54.419 --> 29:56.827
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

29:57.047 --> 29:59.882
And let's make that left-hand turn.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.798
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.639
Right hand.

30:07.391 --> 30:09.679
Good. Good. Okay.

30:13.772 --> 30:16.144
- Are you using both feet?
- Yeah.

30:16.358 --> 30:18.516
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

30:18.735 --> 30:20.858
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

30:21.071 --> 30:23.776
- Why not?
- Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

30:23.991 --> 30:28.736
- Just stop, please. Right. All right.
- Dad, this is way easier.

30:29.329 --> 30:32.164
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

30:32.374 --> 30:35.458
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

30:35.669 --> 30:37.377
- All right.
- Okay?

30:41.967 --> 30:45.383
Okay, just... You don't have to...
Okay. All right. That's fine.

30:45.596 --> 30:48.466
Just... That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

30:48.682 --> 30:52.466
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.931
Okay.

30:55.147 --> 30:58.516
Don't... Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

30:58.734 --> 31:01.225
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

31:01.445 --> 31:03.153
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

31:03.363 --> 31:04.822
I can't do this.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.198
My legs don't work that way.

31:07.409 --> 31:10.244
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

31:10.454 --> 31:13.371
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

31:13.582 --> 31:16.998
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

31:17.211 --> 31:19.369
- All right.
- Here we go. Here we go.

31:21.507 --> 31:24.461
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

31:24.676 --> 31:27.428
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

31:27.638 --> 31:32.300
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

31:32.518 --> 31:34.843
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

31:35.062 --> 31:36.853
- Braking.
- You're using both feet again.

31:37.064 --> 31:39.352
- It's not stopping.
- That's the gas. Use the brake.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.358
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

31:46.490 --> 31:47.865
Okay.

31:48.492 --> 31:50.283
That's one way to stop.

31:51.370 --> 31:53.030
I told you.

31:53.247 --> 31:54.705
Flynn.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.776
- Hands up, asshole!
- Yo, yo, it's cool.

33:06.987 --> 33:08.612
So help me, I will spread you.

33:08.822 --> 33:11.906
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.949
All right? Look, this is my RV.

33:15.162 --> 33:17.783
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

33:17.998 --> 33:19.907
What the hell you doing here?

33:20.417 --> 33:24.118
- You smell like shit.
- It's a long story.

33:24.338 --> 33:26.829
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here...

33:27.049 --> 33:28.247
...750 for the repair.

33:28.467 --> 33:31.670
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

33:31.887 --> 33:36.632
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

33:36.850 --> 33:38.261
Okay.

33:39.061 --> 33:40.555
Here's the thing.

33:40.771 --> 33:42.146
I can't pay you today.

33:42.356 --> 33:44.728
But I can pay you this week,
all right?

33:44.942 --> 33:50.944
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

33:51.156 --> 33:54.074
- I thought your word was your bond.
- It totally is.

33:54.284 --> 33:57.902
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

33:58.163 --> 34:01.449
But I will, soon.

34:01.917 --> 34:03.874
Here's my counteroffer.

34:04.086 --> 34:07.206
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

34:07.422 --> 34:10.044
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

34:10.259 --> 34:13.758
All right. Two grand. Okay?

34:13.971 --> 34:17.505
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

34:17.724 --> 34:22.185
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

34:22.396 --> 34:24.721
Please, all right? I really...

34:24.940 --> 34:30.729
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

34:33.740 --> 34:35.698
Clovis, come on.

34:54.678 --> 34:57.845
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

34:58.056 --> 35:00.761
There's something called
methylamine. Me... Meth...

35:00.976 --> 35:03.384
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

35:03.604 --> 35:06.854
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

35:13.739 --> 35:15.897
Holy shit. How much?

35:22.915 --> 35:24.243
Hey! Hey!

35:59.326 --> 36:00.606
Skyler.

36:06.959 --> 36:09.450
Louis took Walt to school.

36:11.630 --> 36:13.539
I was thinking maybe...

36:14.007 --> 36:16.214
...this would be a good time to talk.

36:37.865 --> 36:43.155
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

36:45.122 --> 36:46.746
In Ireland.

36:50.127 --> 36:51.455
Weird.

36:53.881 --> 36:55.672
Sounds weird.

37:09.146 --> 37:11.601
I wanted to apologise...

37:12.232 --> 37:13.810
...for everything.

37:15.611 --> 37:17.153
My...

37:18.113 --> 37:20.687
...desire for privacy.

37:22.826 --> 37:24.534
My emotional...

37:25.078 --> 37:27.118
...unavailability.

37:28.749 --> 37:31.833
Having cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

37:34.588 --> 37:36.331
I haven't been
a good partner to you...

37:37.216 --> 37:40.216
...and for that...

37:41.136 --> 37:42.963
...I'm very sorry.

37:45.349 --> 37:46.891
I love you.

37:48.727 --> 37:50.636
And I love this family.

37:52.272 --> 37:54.064
And I just...

37:54.650 --> 37:56.441
...want to make sure that...

37:57.444 --> 37:59.567
...we don't lose contact.

38:07.538 --> 38:09.032
Thank you.

38:09.540 --> 38:10.915
Okay.

38:16.213 --> 38:17.672
I agree.

38:33.313 --> 38:34.772
Is that it?

38:36.191 --> 38:37.389
God.

38:37.609 --> 38:39.768
God, how long are
you gonna do this?

38:40.362 --> 38:42.520
- Do what?
- This.

38:42.739 --> 38:44.531
Not talking to me.

38:45.117 --> 38:48.237
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

38:48.453 --> 38:50.695
You are obviously angry with me
about something...

38:50.914 --> 38:53.037
...so let's talk about it.

39:01.633 --> 39:03.009
Oh, God.

39:03.218 --> 39:08.260
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think...

39:08.473 --> 39:11.759
...that I'm up to something.

39:13.729 --> 39:16.895
- Like what?
- I have no idea, Skyler.

39:17.107 --> 39:20.310
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

39:20.527 --> 39:22.567
Is that why you asked me
about the...

39:22.779 --> 39:26.148
Some other phone? Because you think
that I'm being unfaithful?

39:28.285 --> 39:30.194
- I don't know.
- Okay.

39:30.412 --> 39:32.286
So ask me.

39:33.790 --> 39:35.249
Why?

39:35.667 --> 39:38.787
- Would you even tell me?
- Yes. I would.

39:39.004 --> 39:40.831
Of course, I would.

39:41.048 --> 39:46.290
And no. I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

39:46.512 --> 39:49.181
Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

39:49.389 --> 39:52.841
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.851
I heard you, Walt.

39:55.270 --> 39:57.179
You're not having an affair.

39:57.773 --> 39:59.018
Congratulations.

39:59.233 --> 40:01.640
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

40:01.860 --> 40:02.939
Great job.

40:03.153 --> 40:04.861
What is this? What do I have to do?

40:05.072 --> 40:08.986
- I'm trying to talk to you, and you...
- Okay, so talk, Walt.

40:09.493 --> 40:13.822
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

40:14.414 --> 40:17.997
You want to know
what you have to do?

40:18.210 --> 40:22.255
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

40:22.464 --> 40:25.299
Today. No more excuses.

40:25.509 --> 40:29.507
No more apologies.
No more of these... These obvious...

40:29.721 --> 40:32.295
...desperate breakfasts.

40:33.767 --> 40:36.803
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

40:37.104 --> 40:38.563
Good.

40:38.772 --> 40:40.646
Then tell me.

40:42.150 --> 40:43.728
Now.

40:55.163 --> 40:56.907
Tell you what?

41:02.754 --> 41:04.462
Skyler.

41:07.301 --> 41:10.586
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

41:20.522 --> 41:23.096
We're not done here. Skyler.

41:24.735 --> 41:26.774
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

41:32.451 --> 41:33.993
What the...?

41:48.926 --> 41:53.089
- Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
- What is wrong with you?

41:53.305 --> 41:55.796
Why are you blue? Jesus.

41:56.016 --> 41:59.432
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

41:59.645 --> 42:03.429
- ...kleptomaniac douche bags.
- Are you actually this stupid?

42:03.649 --> 42:05.440
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal...

42:05.651 --> 42:09.779
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

42:09.988 --> 42:14.200
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

42:14.701 --> 42:17.371
- Nothing. I'm sorry. I just...
- What if Skyler had seen you?

42:17.579 --> 42:20.450
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

42:20.666 --> 42:22.991
- I don't know.
- You know why you don't know?

42:23.210 --> 42:25.368
Because you don't think. That's why.

42:25.587 --> 42:28.292
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

42:28.507 --> 42:32.172
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

42:33.387 --> 42:34.798
Your half?

42:35.013 --> 42:37.504
There is no your half of the money.

42:37.724 --> 42:40.262
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

42:40.477 --> 42:43.763
Why should I be penalized
because of your sloppiness?

42:43.981 --> 42:45.938
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

42:46.149 --> 42:47.941
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

42:48.151 --> 42:51.188
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

42:51.405 --> 42:54.608
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

42:54.825 --> 42:59.036
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

42:59.246 --> 43:04.453
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow...

43:04.668 --> 43:08.203
...simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re...

43:28.775 --> 43:30.318
Do it.

43:57.888 --> 44:02.016
Try not to touch anything.

45:18.844 --> 45:20.671
Want some breakfast?
