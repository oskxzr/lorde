00:33.909 --> 00:34.909
Why?

00:35.994 --> 00:39.414
Why is this still under discussion?

00:43.085 --> 00:45.670
I don't like him.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.339
I don't care who he knows.

00:49.091 --> 00:53.094
We're supposed to trust
him with our products.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.056
Big man.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.891
Big Generalissimo!

00:59.059 --> 01:02.019
Big fry cook is more like it.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.731
The "Chicken Man."

01:05.399 --> 01:06.941
You will do what you want.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.277
But you have my vote.

01:16.702 --> 01:19.454
Never trust a South American.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.123
Dirty, dirty people.

01:27.171 --> 01:30.298
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!

01:30.591 --> 01:33.634
He was just having fun.

01:35.721 --> 01:36.804
You'll get over it.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.932
No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!

01:53.781 --> 01:55.740
Marco.

01:58.702 --> 02:02.580
Grab your old uncle a beer,
would you?

02:06.251 --> 02:08.503
No, no. A cold one.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.222
This is what you wanted.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.099
Your brother dead. Right?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.356
You're going to have to
try harder than that...

02:29.191 --> 02:31.150
...if you want to save him.

02:32.778 --> 02:36.447
How much longer do you think
he has down there?

02:37.032 --> 02:40.827
One minute? Maybe more?
Maybe less?

02:56.844 --> 02:59.846
Family is all.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.321
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.658
All right, you can call my lawyer,
Saul Goodman.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.618
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

04:45.953 --> 04:49.163
You hear me? I got nothing to say.
I told you, you can call my...

04:51.500 --> 04:52.500
Christ!

04:53.418 --> 04:57.296
You got my cell phone number,
my wife's name! How did you do it?

04:57.589 --> 05:00.132
Talk! Who you working with?!

06:11.747 --> 06:13.164
Yes, sir.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.593
If you're ready to talk...

06:25.761 --> 06:27.678
...they wanna get a statement.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.931
Your side of what happened here.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.269
Or we can hold them off
till another time.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.234
Maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.954
There it is.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.625
Yo, Adrian.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.127
Rocky called,
he wants his face back.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.589
Come on, I gotta cheer you up.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.717
You see that?
That's your get-out-of-jail-free card.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.803
You understand
get-out-of-jail-free card?

07:09.012 --> 07:12.098
I mean, just blink once
if you're following.

07:12.265 --> 07:16.102
The DEA's worst nightmare
is that face out in public.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.271
They'll have to steer a wide berth
of young Master Pinkman...

07:19.439 --> 07:22.942
...for fear of the PR poop storm
that will rain down on them...

07:23.110 --> 07:26.946
...if this story ever gets out.
I mean, this beating?

07:27.239 --> 07:29.240
Best thing for you.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.783
You're home free.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.661
Good, right?

07:34.412 --> 07:35.788
Right.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.643
Oh, my God.

07:57.853 --> 08:03.190
You're now the cute one of the group.
Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.696
This is... I...

08:09.531 --> 08:15.161
Jesse, I'm... I am so sorry for this.
This should not have happened.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.873
But it did.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.625
No thanks to you.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.673
But the plan did work.

08:27.841 --> 08:32.178
We would've been locked up right now
if we didn't lure him away. But this...

08:32.804 --> 08:34.972
This... I just...

08:35.307 --> 08:36.724
I never saw this coming.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.606
So...

08:44.816 --> 08:46.233
What...?

08:47.235 --> 08:50.696
What happens now?

08:50.864 --> 08:54.909
I'll tell you what happens now.

08:55.202 --> 08:59.538
Your scumbag brother-in-law
is finished.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.540
Done.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.209
You understand?

09:03.752 --> 09:07.588
I will own him when this is over.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.841
Every cent he earns...

09:11.009 --> 09:14.511
...every cent his wife earns...

09:14.679 --> 09:17.056
...is mine.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.433
Anyplace he goes...

09:19.643 --> 09:21.685
...anywhere he turns...

09:21.853 --> 09:23.896
...I'm gonna be there...

09:24.064 --> 09:26.690
...grabbing my share.

09:27.192 --> 09:31.779
He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana
for pennies...

09:31.947 --> 09:34.281
...and I'll be standing over him...

09:34.449 --> 09:36.700
...to get my cut.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.245
He'll see me when he wakes up...

09:39.412 --> 09:44.291
...and when he crawls to sleep
in whatever rat hole is left for him...

09:44.459 --> 09:48.045
...after I shred his house down.

09:48.964 --> 09:52.967
I will haunt his crusty ass...

09:53.134 --> 09:54.885
...forever...

09:55.136 --> 09:57.221
...until the day...

09:57.430 --> 10:00.724
...he sticks a gun up his mouth...

10:00.892 --> 10:02.977
...and pulls the trigger...

10:03.186 --> 10:06.313
...just to get me out of his head.

10:07.607 --> 10:13.279
That's what happens next.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.080
My advice:

10:23.665 --> 10:26.500
That's probably
not a good strategy.

10:26.710 --> 10:30.671
They're scared of you right now.
They want nothing to do with you.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.673
But if you hit them...

10:32.841 --> 10:35.592
...they're forced to hit back hard.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.680
I mean, they will turn over every rock
hither, thither and yon...

10:39.848 --> 10:43.600
...until someone spills the beans on you
and anyone associated with you...

10:43.768 --> 10:45.352
...present company included.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.522
Yes, I think what Saul is saying
makes a lot of sense.

10:48.982 --> 10:53.193
Jesse, move on with your life.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.862
Leave it behind, all of it.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.323
Nothing changes...

10:57.490 --> 10:59.950
...once I walk out of here.

11:00.493 --> 11:05.039
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooking again.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.626
How exactly do you think...

11:09.794 --> 11:13.213
...you're going to get away with that?
They will catch you.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.215
- So what?
- What?

11:15.383 --> 11:17.384
I have a get-out-of-jail-free card.

11:17.552 --> 11:22.514
Hey, I may have overstated
the power of your face.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.184
Not this.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.562
If the cops catch me...

11:29.773 --> 11:32.858
...I give them
what they want the most.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.864
You.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.913
They nab me...

11:46.289 --> 11:48.332
...I make a deal...

11:48.500 --> 11:53.170
...to give up the great Heisenberg...

11:53.338 --> 11:57.591
...and his million-dollar drug ring.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.056
You're my free pass...

12:04.891 --> 12:06.934
...bitch.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.107
You're so sure.

12:13.274 --> 12:17.027
Look, if he didn't give up my name
while Hank was beating him...

12:17.195 --> 12:18.779
...he's never going to talk.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.281
What do you think that was, a bluff?

12:21.449 --> 12:24.952
He wants your brother-in-law.
And there's gonna be lawyers...

12:25.120 --> 12:27.413
...creaming their Underoos
for a case like that.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.125
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.793
And him cooking again?

12:32.961 --> 12:37.131
Hey, when, not if, he gets caught,
and he's facing 20 years...

12:37.340 --> 12:41.802
...what'll he do then? Believe me,
there's no honor among thieves.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.055
Except for us, of course.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.558
No, he'll...

12:47.725 --> 12:49.768
He'll come around.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.396
And if he doesn't...

12:52.564 --> 12:55.065
...there may come a time
to talk options.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.817
Options?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.251
I'm convinced
Mr. Pinkman was involved...

13:14.419 --> 13:17.754
...in the manufacture and distribution
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine...

13:17.922 --> 13:20.090
...specifically what we call
the blue meth.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.176
I tracked him to a scrap yard...

13:22.343 --> 13:24.845
...where he stored
an early-'80s camper...

13:25.013 --> 13:26.680
...an RV.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.683
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle...

13:29.851 --> 13:32.686
...which I believe to be
a rolling meth lab...

13:32.896 --> 13:35.355
...I received a telephone call...

13:35.815 --> 13:40.652
...telling me my wife Marie
had been injured in an accident.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.112
Upon hearing the news...

13:42.280 --> 13:46.533
...I left Mr. Pinkman
and his vehicle to tend to my wife.

13:47.452 --> 13:50.871
Arriving at the hospital, I learned
the emergency call was a hoax.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.458
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.

13:57.295 --> 14:01.465
So I immediately went back to
the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.884
Most likely destroyed on site.

14:04.052 --> 14:07.346
And it was at this point you drove
to the home of Jesse Pinkman?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.068
I think we're done here.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.820
Agent Schrader needs to get home...

14:23.988 --> 14:25.030
...get some rest.

14:25.198 --> 14:30.035
That's fine. But just to confirm,
you're taking the Fifth here?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.703
Yeah, that's correct.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.705
Okay. Well...

14:33.873 --> 14:36.375
...we just wanna give you all
a heads up.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.254
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
in this matter.

14:40.421 --> 14:44.591
He's given a detailed version
of events as he sees them.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.093
The word of a meth head.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.928
We know all about his history.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.598
We're well aware,
but toxicology on Pinkman...

14:52.767 --> 14:55.185
His blood is clean, he's not using.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.438
The kid is even refusing his
doctor-ordered pain meds...

14:58.606 --> 15:00.399
...far as we can tell.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.778
So...

15:06.739 --> 15:08.407
...where do we go from here?

15:08.575 --> 15:11.201
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down...

15:11.369 --> 15:13.245
...probably tomorrow morning.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.581
Janice will give us an exact time.

15:15.748 --> 15:20.752
And you men will be continuing
your investigation, so...

15:21.546 --> 15:24.923
- Thanks for your time.
- Right. We just...

15:25.091 --> 15:26.300
We need one more thing.

15:27.135 --> 15:31.597
A photo of Agent Schrader's hands.
For the record.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.308
Yes, of course.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.810
Bandage off, if you would.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.568
On the table is fine.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.821
Flat on the table. That's fine.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.048
It's all gonna work out.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.927
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

17:34.095 --> 17:39.433
I hope it goes without saying we're not
talking to anybody about this, okay?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.269
Okay.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.939
Marie...

17:46.149 --> 17:47.899
...who?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.477
Hi.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.937
Do you have a minute?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.148
Sure.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.998
I guess crime does pay.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.672
I don't suppose you just came by
to insult me.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.511
No. We need to talk.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.222
You heard about Hank?

19:00.807 --> 19:04.518
About what happened
with this Jesse Pinkman?

19:05.102 --> 19:06.853
Yes, I know.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.356
Whatever Hank was investigating...

19:09.524 --> 19:13.443
...him trying to find an RV...

19:13.611 --> 19:15.362
...is there any danger...

19:15.530 --> 19:17.948
...that could lead back to you?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.325
No.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.202
Why would it?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.874
Is this why you're here?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.378
I'm here to talk about Hank.

19:34.048 --> 19:38.552
You know what's gonna happen to him
if this Pinkman presses charges?

19:40.972 --> 19:43.390
Hank could lose everything.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.395
I thought maybe...

19:50.398 --> 19:52.774
...there's a way you could help him.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.860
How?

19:55.069 --> 19:57.904
Contact Pinkman.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.156
Get him to drop the charges.

20:00.324 --> 20:04.578
I don't know what kind of relationship
you picture me having with this person.

20:04.745 --> 20:09.249
- I'm not asking.
- He was... He's... He's not my friend.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.877
- It's not as if we were even close.
- I'm...

20:12.044 --> 20:14.087
I'm not asking.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.882
But there must be something
you could say.

20:17.592 --> 20:20.093
Isn't it even worth a try?

20:20.928 --> 20:23.305
Hank is your family.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.101
Not currently.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.352
What?

20:29.812 --> 20:32.355
I said, not currently.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.902
I'm late. I have to go.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.477
Hello.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.563
I was starting to get worried.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.983
Car trouble.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.903
Oh, that's a bummer.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.740
You should call me next time.
I'll pick you up.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.622
No sandals today?

21:31.499 --> 21:32.999
I just thought...

21:34.085 --> 21:36.670
A bit more professional.

21:37.171 --> 21:40.298
Well, everything is on track.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.970
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to...

21:45.137 --> 21:47.097
Let's get our trays ready.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.683
- Clean, no moisture.
- Done.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.021
Is our?

21:55.982 --> 21:57.440
Our solvent filtered?

21:57.942 --> 21:59.693
I thought you might ask that.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.902
Done.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.533
That's good.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.953
Hand in glove,
that's what we strive for.

22:11.664 --> 22:16.209
You know, this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

22:48.242 --> 22:50.243
So you the gentlemen?

22:53.914 --> 22:57.584
Lucky you boys caught me,
I got a load to pick up in Memphis.

22:57.752 --> 23:02.088
I can hammer it out in about 15,
but there's this girl, Lolly. Maybe Fran.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.591
She's got this fetish,
she likes to get peed on.

23:04.759 --> 23:08.094
I was hoping to see her tonight
but she wants to sleep before 10...

23:08.262 --> 23:12.766
...so I wanna wrap it up here ASAP
because traffic can be a wild card.

23:13.476 --> 23:17.937
Thing is, women who like to get peed
on tend to be from the warmer climates.

23:18.105 --> 23:21.107
You'd think the ones in colder zones
would be more inclined.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.693
Maybe it's a shock
if the body's not acclimated...

23:23.861 --> 23:27.197
...but, you know, I leave that
for smarter minds than me.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.575
Science is a mystery.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.703
Well, take a gander.
Prices are negotiable.

23:33.871 --> 23:37.957
Buying in bulk gets you a discount.
I'm running a special on these honeys.

23:39.001 --> 23:43.463
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,
known as Black Death. Check it out.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.465
Like that?
So sweet, you wanna lick it.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.967
Nickel-plated brass casing,
Lubalox coat.

23:48.135 --> 23:51.471
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact:

23:51.639 --> 23:54.140
Shred your mama's head
like a cabbage.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.811
Keep it. On the house.
But I been windjamming enough.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.231
Tell me what you're looking for,
what it is you need.

24:01.607 --> 24:02.649
Vests.

24:02.817 --> 24:05.777
Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.654
Right here.

24:11.408 --> 24:14.994
Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded,
non-interwoven Kevlar fiber.

24:15.162 --> 24:18.998
Stop a bullet like a soft wang against
a Quaker girl. Ain't getting through.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.836
And lightweight? So lightweight,
you'll forget you're wearing it.

24:24.505 --> 24:25.839
They work?

24:26.549 --> 24:28.675
Sure as shit, they do.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.969
I don't leave home without it.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.687
What the hell?

24:41.438 --> 24:45.358
You broke my freaking rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.391
You're welcome!

25:36.660 --> 25:37.702
Gale.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.663
What temperature did you set here?

25:40.831 --> 25:42.373
Here?

25:42.708 --> 25:45.251
Station five, 75 C.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.256
I said 85.

25:50.424 --> 25:51.591
Eight-five.

25:55.429 --> 25:58.264
I wrote it down. You said 75.

25:58.432 --> 26:00.600
- I wrote it.
- Well, you wrote it wrong.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.435
That's not what I said.

26:02.603 --> 26:03.895
I said 85.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.273
It's always been 85.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.860
Not 75. Not 95.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.237
Eighty-five.

26:12.529 --> 26:16.074
This is chemistry. Degrees matter.

26:19.703 --> 26:20.954
I'm sorry.

26:21.664 --> 26:23.122
I'm very sorry.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.415
Great.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.125
You're sorry, meanwhile...

26:26.293 --> 26:30.255
...you've just brewed 50 gallons
of useless sludge. Congratulations.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.799
Just dump it. Dump it all.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.926
This batch is ruined.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.961
You look nice.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.007
I look like a TV weatherman.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.844
You want a coffee?

27:20.681 --> 27:22.265
No.

27:24.435 --> 27:27.937
I squeezed some orange juice.
You want a glass of orange juice?

27:28.856 --> 27:30.440
I'm all right.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.866
What are you gonna tell them?

27:44.621 --> 27:46.456
Here's what you'll tell them.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.500
He attacked you.

27:49.960 --> 27:54.213
- He attacked me?
- He swung at you with something.

27:54.381 --> 27:57.383
- Swung at me?
- He attacked you with a pipe.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.218
A pipe.

28:00.554 --> 28:05.183
It happened fast. He resisted arrest
and muscle memory kicked in...

28:05.351 --> 28:07.643
...and you had to disarm him.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.562
Muscle memory.

28:09.730 --> 28:14.859
Happens all the time. Years of training,
your body acted faster than your brain.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.736
You had no choice but to hit him.

28:16.904 --> 28:20.073
- You had to fight back.
- Marie, Marie, Marie.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.700
No.

28:24.078 --> 28:25.828
I'm not gonna go in there and lie.

28:25.996 --> 28:30.416
It's some lowlife degenerate
versus you...

28:31.335 --> 28:34.045
...doing the job you're supposed to.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.924
Why should you be the one
who pays...

28:38.092 --> 28:39.926
...for doing the right thing?

28:40.094 --> 28:42.804
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.099
It's not what the job is.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.519
I'm supposed to be better than that.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.773
And you made one mistake.

28:55.275 --> 28:58.111
No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been...

29:00.572 --> 29:02.532
I've been...

29:04.618 --> 29:08.287
...unraveling, you know?

29:12.042 --> 29:14.585
I don't sleep at night anymore.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.964
I freeze.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.091
I freeze up.

29:21.802 --> 29:25.346
My chest gets all tight.
I can't breathe.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.099
Just...

29:29.059 --> 29:30.893
I panic.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.732
Ever since that Salamanca thing.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.943
I mean, Tuco Salamanca.

29:39.111 --> 29:43.072
If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet
between the eyes...

29:47.828 --> 29:49.996
It changed me.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.170
And I can't seem to control it.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.925
I tried to fight it.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.138
But then...

30:07.431 --> 30:09.098
...El Paso.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.894
And it's just gotten worse.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.524
What I did to Pinkman...

30:21.195 --> 30:24.697
...that's not who I'm supposed to be.
That's not me.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.702
All this...

30:31.163 --> 30:33.539
...everything that's happened, I...

30:34.917 --> 30:38.336
I swear to God, Marie,
I think the universe...

30:39.046 --> 30:41.214
...is trying to tell me something...

30:41.423 --> 30:43.549
...and I'm finally...

30:44.676 --> 30:46.719
...ready to listen.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.730
I'm just not the man I thought I was.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.569
I think I'm done as a cop.

31:14.331 --> 31:19.835
Now, this is not an easy decision,
but it is one that I have to make.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.712
I'm sorry.

31:21.880 --> 31:26.759
This whole Gale situation, he's...

31:26.969 --> 31:29.428
He's just not working out.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.392
Yes, now.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.603
It may sound unorthodox...

31:37.771 --> 31:43.609
...but I think our first best option...

31:45.404 --> 31:47.863
...is Jesse Pinkman.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.119
Hello?

31:59.793 --> 32:04.964
No, look. There's a shorthand
that exists between us...

32:05.132 --> 32:06.924
...experience together...

32:07.092 --> 32:12.638
...at a level that, quite frankly,
I'm just never going to reach with Gale.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.937
Look, Mr. Fring...

32:20.647 --> 32:25.985
...when I accepted your offer,
I was told the lab is mine.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.654
And I know best how to run it.

32:33.994 --> 32:37.330
Thank you.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.416
Yes, I will. I will.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.044
Okay. Goodbye.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.927
Listen, something's come up.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.307
I think it's a good opportunity.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.854
There's been a job opening.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.564
I need a new lab assistant.

33:05.859 --> 33:09.070
I already did my time.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.864
Why don't you just go get yourself
a monkey?

33:13.158 --> 33:14.950
I don't want a monkey.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.203
I want you.

33:17.371 --> 33:19.705
Oh, gee, thanks.

33:19.873 --> 33:22.208
Well, not interested.

33:23.043 --> 33:26.212
I got my own thing going on.

33:26.380 --> 33:30.466
And nice try, saving your asshead
brother-in-law.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.348
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.183
There's more.

33:40.394 --> 33:43.396
It's more than an assistant.

33:44.106 --> 33:45.564
Partners.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.734
We'll be partners again.

33:48.902 --> 33:52.405
Split everything fifty-fifty,
just like before.

33:54.408 --> 33:59.203
One-point-five million dollars each.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.044
No.

34:12.718 --> 34:18.013
- I don't think you heard...
- I heard you fine.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.267
I said no.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.564
Let me understand this.

34:27.232 --> 34:30.901
You're turning down
one and a half million dollars...

34:31.069 --> 34:34.697
I am not turning down the money.

34:34.865 --> 34:38.242
I am turning down you.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.286
You get it?

34:40.579 --> 34:44.457
I want nothing to do with you.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.377
Ever since I met you...

34:48.587 --> 34:52.923
...everything I've ever cared about...

34:53.091 --> 34:55.217
...is gone.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.929
Ruined, turned to shit...

34:59.097 --> 35:04.477
...dead, ever since I hooked up
with the great Heisenberg.

35:05.687 --> 35:08.939
I have never been more alone.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.318
I have nothing!

35:12.486 --> 35:14.570
No one!

35:15.113 --> 35:17.573
All right? It's all gone!

35:17.741 --> 35:19.492
Get it?

35:20.660 --> 35:21.786
No.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.580
No, no. Why...?

35:25.332 --> 35:29.001
Why would you get it?

35:29.169 --> 35:35.633
What do you even care,
as long as you get what you want?

35:35.801 --> 35:37.092
Right?

35:37.260 --> 35:42.264
You don't give a shit about me.

35:44.017 --> 35:46.769
You said I was no good.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.522
I'm nothing!

35:50.148 --> 35:53.192
Why would you want me, huh?

35:53.360 --> 35:58.823
You said my meth is inferior, right?

35:59.366 --> 36:04.620
Right? Hey, you said my cook
was garbage!

36:04.788 --> 36:07.122
Hey, screw you, man!

36:07.290 --> 36:09.667
Screw you.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.550
Your meth is good, Jesse.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.135
As good as mine.

37:18.612 --> 37:20.070
Yeah.

37:21.531 --> 37:23.782
Fifty-fifty.

37:25.118 --> 37:26.785
Yes, fifty-fifty.

37:29.331 --> 37:30.956
Okay.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.626
Partners.

37:39.633 --> 37:41.467
Good.

38:30.183 --> 38:32.977
And this is the statement
you want to give?

38:33.645 --> 38:35.479
Yes, sir.

38:36.439 --> 38:39.400
- Hank, you don't have to do this.
- No, I...

38:40.652 --> 38:42.152
I do.

38:43.363 --> 38:44.947
I'm good.

38:48.201 --> 38:53.038
So we understand
if we write it up like that, you'll sign it.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.001
That's the way it happened.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.962
I accept the consequences.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.886
In the light of these facts...

39:08.972 --> 39:11.432
...as of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

39:11.891 --> 39:15.394
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.438
Yes, sir.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.219
Schrader.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.055
Hold up.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.765
Yes, sir?

39:53.475 --> 39:55.392
I just wanted to tell you something.

39:55.560 --> 39:59.104
And you didn't hear it from me.
Don't want you to get your hopes up...

39:59.272 --> 40:02.941
...but the word in the pipeline is
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.905
- Why not?
- Who the hell knows?

40:08.782 --> 40:11.408
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.265
It went fine.

40:36.142 --> 40:39.561
Well, fine means what it means,
yeah.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.772
I'll...

40:42.565 --> 40:45.109
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.445
Yeah. It's...

40:48.822 --> 40:50.614
Yeah, it's just...

40:50.824 --> 40:52.658
I don't know, baby, I just think...

40:52.826 --> 40:55.994
I think we may be okay. Yeah.

40:56.246 --> 40:58.580
Okay. I love you too.

41:19.686 --> 41:22.938
- Schrader.
- I need you to listen very carefully.

41:23.106 --> 41:25.190
Two men are coming to kill you.

41:25.692 --> 41:26.775
Come again?

41:26.943 --> 41:31.029
They're approaching your car.
You have one minute.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.657
I don't get the gag, jagoff.
Who is this?

41:33.825 --> 41:35.784
They're coming.

41:36.286 --> 41:37.828
Hello?

41:52.719 --> 41:53.844
Hey, li...

41:56.014 --> 42:00.893
Gomey, I don't know what that call was,
but it's dumb even by your standards...

42:01.102 --> 42:03.187
...so call me when you get this.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.934
Finish him.

44:31.461 --> 44:32.753
Jesus.

45:14.921 --> 45:16.713
No.

45:18.508 --> 45:20.300
Too easy.
