00:44.378 --> 00:47.172
- Well, hello there.
- Hi, I hope we're not too late.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.007
- No, no. Perfect timing.
- Okay.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.176
- Stan, this is my husband, Walt.
- Hi.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.345
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.597
- Sandia Laboratories, huh?
- Yeah.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.350
I hear some fascinating stuff
goes on out there.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.143
Yeah, well, you know.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.396
Working on anything
you can talk about?

01:02.604 --> 01:05.440
I'm picturing giant space lasers.
Am I right?

01:05.649 --> 01:08.485
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

01:08.694 --> 01:13.365
Giant space lasers? That sounds cool.
I'll bring it up at our next staff meeting.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.702
- Well, just remember I get a cut.
- All right. It's a deal.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.997
So this is it, honey. What do you say?
Wanna take a tour?

01:20.205 --> 01:22.165
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.211
Look, how about
I give ya'll some privacy?

01:26.420 --> 01:30.924
I'll go out to the car, make a few calls.
Take as much time as you need.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.886
- All right.
- Okay, thanks.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.141
- He's a nice guy. He doesn't push.
- Yeah.

01:39.349 --> 01:43.979
So as you can see,
there's this kind of flow going on here.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.064
- It's a nice big living room.
- Yeah.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.985
And this is the dining area.

01:50.194 --> 01:54.489
- Oh, the dining area. Right.
- Yes. Oh, and...

01:55.282 --> 01:56.617
...it's got a pool.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.494
Pool is nice.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.456
Backyard could be a little bigger.

02:02.664 --> 02:07.669
And... Oh, there's a breakfast bar
kind of dealie here, which is nice.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.797
And, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious...

02:11.006 --> 02:13.842
...and, you know,
got good appliances and...

02:14.051 --> 02:15.761
How many bedrooms?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.846
Three. Told you.

02:18.055 --> 02:22.142
They're all pretty good size and...
Oh, this is the first one here.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.770
And then there's two more
at the back.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.939
Only three bedrooms?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.858
We're gonna need at least five,
don't you think?

02:30.025 --> 02:31.568
- Five?
- Yeah.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.446
What, do I look like
I'm about to drop a litter?

02:34.655 --> 02:39.993
No, no, no.
We'll have three kids total, eventually.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.746
Yeah, but we'll need
a spare room for a study...

02:42.955 --> 02:46.083
...so that I can work at home
and you can write.

02:46.792 --> 02:51.088
Yeah, no.
I don't think this is gonna be... enough.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.217
Okay, what about a wine cellar?

02:55.425 --> 02:59.221
I mean, we certainly cannot be
expected to live without a wine cellar.

02:59.429 --> 03:03.433
Very funny. I just think we need
to set our sights high is all.

03:03.642 --> 03:08.564
- At least, higher than here.
- Walt, this is a good neighbourhood.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.900
It's got a good elementary
and a very good high school...

03:12.109 --> 03:17.072
...and believe me, because I have
definitely looked everywhere.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.992
For our price range,
this is as good as it gets.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.161
Well, then let's stretch our price range.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.038
Truly. I mean, why...?

03:25.247 --> 03:29.418
Why buy a starter house when we'll
have to move out in a year or two?

03:29.626 --> 03:31.962
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

03:32.171 --> 03:33.964
I'm serious.

03:34.173 --> 03:37.593
Come on. Why be cautious?

03:37.801 --> 03:40.679
We've got nowhere to go but up.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.274
- Yeah.
<i>- Walter, you see us?</i>

05:57.482 --> 05:58.984
Yeah. I see you.

05:59.818 --> 06:04.114
<i>I'd like you to exit your vehicle
and start walking toward us.</i>

06:04.323 --> 06:08.160
And then what?
I'm gonna need some...

06:08.744 --> 06:11.455
Some kind of assurance.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.625
<i>I assure you,
I could kill you from way over here...</i>

06:14.833 --> 06:17.503
<i>...if it makes you feel any better.</i>

07:11.390 --> 07:15.310
Walter, you've been busy.

07:15.602 --> 07:19.314
You wanna put your arms out
to your sides for me, if you would?

07:35.330 --> 07:38.125
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

07:38.333 --> 07:41.295
I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.297
I need my sleep.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.551
You said no half measures.

07:47.759 --> 07:53.390
Yeah. Funny how words can be so open
to interpretation.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.561
- You get your car fixed?
- Not yet.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.063
You're gonna wanna
get your car fixed.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.150
Let's see how this goes first.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.020
Has your condition worsened?

08:40.395 --> 08:43.065
- Excuse me?
- Your medical condition.

08:43.232 --> 08:46.151
- Has it grown worse?
- Not that I know of, no.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.946
Is there a ringing in your ears?

08:49.154 --> 08:51.657
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

08:53.242 --> 08:57.621
- I'm quite well, thank you.
- No. Clearly, you are not.

08:57.788 --> 09:01.166
No rational person would do
as you have done.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.212
Explain yourself.

09:07.714 --> 09:11.218
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.886
I intervened.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.514
Some worthless junkie.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.809
For him, you intervened
and put us all at risk.

09:19.017 --> 09:22.813
Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
keep the peace for eight hours.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.440
That's right. He couldn't.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.151
He was angry because those
two dealers of yours...

09:28.360 --> 09:30.487
...had just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.531
I heard about it.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.492
He should have
let me take care of them.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.411
Maybe.

09:37.786 --> 09:41.748
Then again, maybe he thought
it was you who gave the order.

09:44.334 --> 09:50.340
Are you asking me
if I ordered the murder of a child?

09:51.967 --> 09:54.636
I would never ask you that.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.060
Where is Pinkman now?

10:04.146 --> 10:06.273
I wouldn't know.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.985
Couple of time zones away, at least.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.572
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.

10:13.780 --> 10:18.202
He has enough money to last forever,
he knows he needs to keep moving.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.953
You'll never find him.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.039
I don't know, Walt...

10:22.706 --> 10:25.417
...it's what I do, after all.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.421
He's out of the picture.

10:29.630 --> 10:33.675
I saved his life, I owed him that,
but now he and I are done.

10:33.842 --> 10:37.054
Which is exactly what you wanted,
isn't it?

10:41.934 --> 10:45.020
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man.

10:45.187 --> 10:48.690
So if I may,
I would like to review options with you.

10:48.899 --> 10:52.778
Of which, it seems to me,
you have two.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.947
Option A:

10:55.322 --> 10:56.990
You kill me right here and now.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.118
Apparently,
I have made that very easy for you.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.913
You can kill me, no witnesses...

11:03.121 --> 11:06.917
...and then spend the next few weeks
or months...

11:07.084 --> 11:09.920
...tracking down Jesse Pinkman
and you kill him too.

11:10.337 --> 11:14.508
A pointless exercise, it seems to me,
but that is option A.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.343
What is option B?

11:16.552 --> 11:17.928
I continue cooking.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.973
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.433
We forget this ever happened.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.311
We consider this a lone hiccup...

11:26.478 --> 11:31.275
...in an otherwise long
and fruitful business arrangement.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.404
I prefer option B.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.246
You'd need a new assistant.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.666
- I could get right on that.
- No.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.085
This time, I choose.

12:06.185 --> 12:07.936
Your car...

12:08.145 --> 12:09.813
...get it fixed.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.565
Yeah.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.814
Really?

13:20.467 --> 13:21.927
It's good to see you.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.389
Thanks.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.600
It's good to be back.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.478
Well, shall we?

13:31.687 --> 13:35.649
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

13:45.075 --> 13:48.245
What about that rhinoceros?
You think he'd make a good pet?

13:48.453 --> 13:50.038
- No.
- No?

13:50.247 --> 13:52.916
Don't you think if you called,
he'd come running?

13:53.083 --> 13:56.086
I bet he would.
I bet he'd come running:

13:56.920 --> 13:58.088
You're silly, Pop-Pop.

13:58.297 --> 14:01.341
Well, a little. But he'd probably
knock everything over.

14:01.550 --> 14:06.138
- Plus, there's that big nose of his.
- That's not a nose, that's a horn.

14:06.346 --> 14:10.517
- Is that so?
- His real nose is little.

14:11.643 --> 14:15.022
I learn all kinds of things
being with you.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.235
Okay, June bug, these are for you.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.738
- What about the rest?
- The rest are for me.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.449
No, they're not.
You're too old for balloons.

14:27.159 --> 14:31.079
You're never too old for balloons.
Give me a hug.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.540
I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.

14:33.749 --> 14:36.210
- Bye, Pop-Pop.
- Bye, baby.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.546
Hi, sweetie.
Did you have fun with Pop-Pop?

15:29.700 --> 15:31.100
What do you think?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.400
There is only one way
to find out...

16:03.600 --> 16:05.600
- What is that?
- I don't know.

16:42.002 --> 16:45.047
Please. Please, no.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.669
Chow, you have anything
you wanna tell me?

18:05.878 --> 18:08.589
Thank God you're here.
They keep me prisoner.

18:08.797 --> 18:12.676
- They keep you prisoner.
- I don't do nothing for them ever.

18:12.843 --> 18:16.013
They try and make me. I say, no.

18:16.221 --> 18:21.310
They steal my chemicals.
I can't stop them. I am businessman.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.021
You're a business...
The lady out front...

18:24.229 --> 18:27.774
Hey, lady, are you still there?
Ask her if she's still there.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.124
She says, yes.

18:45.626 --> 18:49.046
How's her driving? Driving.
Is she good behind the wheel?

18:49.254 --> 18:51.673
Good. She's good driver.

18:51.882 --> 18:54.551
Licensed? Dependable?

18:54.760 --> 18:56.053
She has a Camry.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.804
Good.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.853
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

19:05.062 --> 19:08.857
I strongly recommend
that you return our calls next time.

19:09.066 --> 19:11.235
So have her drive you to the hospital.

19:15.405 --> 19:18.492
She's gonna need her shoe.

19:28.961 --> 19:32.214
- Where'd they cross?
- Laredo, looks like.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.092
They didn't exactly send
their A players.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.262
But like you said, it's cartel, all right.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.391
Probing for weakness.

19:43.809 --> 19:46.186
Well, they didn't find any.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.066
What about Pinkman?

19:51.900 --> 19:54.570
I'm making inquiries.

20:10.502 --> 20:14.214
Yeah, that's two.
All right, let's close it up.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.640
All right, bring it down.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.393
You ready?

20:30.898 --> 20:33.192
Okay, we're good.

20:38.697 --> 20:41.366
You can take your mask off now.

20:51.335 --> 20:53.253
Does that guy ever leave?

20:56.507 --> 20:59.134
When exactly did that start?

20:59.635 --> 21:01.553
It's new.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.223
We had a...

21:05.224 --> 21:08.977
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.439
- Sorry to hear that.
- No, it'll be fine.

21:12.648 --> 21:15.859
Things will continue
to smooth out and...

21:16.318 --> 21:18.403
Yeah, it'll be fine.

21:20.781 --> 21:25.410
By the way, if you're at all worried
about working with me...

21:25.619 --> 21:27.496
No, I'm not.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.748
Whatever my shortcomings
last time...

21:29.915 --> 21:33.210
...I intend for things to go perfectly
from here on out.

21:33.418 --> 21:37.005
- So if there is...?
- Gale, you're great.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.883
- Seriously.
- I just...

21:40.050 --> 21:45.180
However you like things to be done
is exactly how we're gonna do them.

21:45.389 --> 21:47.224
Period.

21:47.808 --> 21:50.936
From here on out, so...

21:53.063 --> 21:54.606
Please, teach me.

22:01.196 --> 22:02.990
Okay.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.324
Gale. It's good to see you.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.159
Mr. Fring.

23:29.368 --> 23:30.953
Wow, this is...

23:31.161 --> 23:34.414
I should have called.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

23:35.207 --> 23:38.627
No. No, no, not at all.
Please, come in.

23:40.671 --> 23:43.090
Can I offer you something?
A crème de menthe?

23:43.298 --> 23:45.968
No. No, thank you.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.679
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

23:48.887 --> 23:53.058
Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.

23:54.476 --> 23:57.062
I need to talk to you
about something.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.690
Something rather pressing.

24:03.151 --> 24:06.572
If push came to shove,
I was wondering...

24:06.780 --> 24:10.659
...how soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

24:10.868 --> 24:13.036
You and an assistant.

24:13.704 --> 24:15.455
Why would...?

24:16.748 --> 24:20.878
- Why would push come to shove?
- Has Walter ever talked to you...

24:21.086 --> 24:24.673
...about why he got into
this particular line of work?

24:26.592 --> 24:29.261
I guess I assumed
it was because it pays so well.

24:29.428 --> 24:32.097
It is, but specifically...

24:32.264 --> 24:35.225
...has he... ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

24:38.061 --> 24:42.274
I'm not surprised.
He's a very private person.

24:42.774 --> 24:45.777
What exactly
are his health problems?

24:45.986 --> 24:48.197
He's dying of cancer.

24:48.739 --> 24:53.660
It is why he does this, to provide for
his family, which he's accomplished.

24:54.203 --> 24:58.040
They will never want for anything,
he's seen to that.

25:02.503 --> 25:03.795
How long does he have?

25:05.422 --> 25:08.091
That is very much the question.

25:08.509 --> 25:12.638
He does not wanna talk about it.
And every time I bring it up with him...

25:14.139 --> 25:19.353
I don't know that he's fully accepted
the reality of it.

25:20.521 --> 25:24.316
And not to sound cold-blooded,
but I am running a business here.

25:24.983 --> 25:29.530
- No, I understand.
- I have a very large investment in this.

25:29.738 --> 25:32.866
There's so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down.

25:33.075 --> 25:34.451
Not even for a week.

25:34.660 --> 25:38.038
So you understand my concern.

25:38.247 --> 25:41.291
And my desire for continuity.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.918
I do. Absolutely.

25:43.126 --> 25:47.339
Now, I intend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants...

25:47.548 --> 25:51.426
...assuming that
he's physically up to it.

25:51.635 --> 25:57.349
But as he cannot or will not tell me
how long that might be...

25:57.558 --> 26:02.396
...I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.691
Well, worst-case scenario...

26:12.197 --> 26:14.950
I suppose if we had...

26:15.617 --> 26:18.412
...at least a few more cooks together.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.748
You don't think you're ready now?

26:22.124 --> 26:24.126
Well, I mean...

26:24.334 --> 26:26.837
...he is such a...

26:28.046 --> 26:29.214
A master.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.676
There's always more for me to learn.

26:34.845 --> 26:39.683
But I'm thinking that if we had...

26:39.892 --> 26:41.602
...say...

26:42.269 --> 26:44.062
...one or two more cooks.

26:49.067 --> 26:50.903
One more...

26:51.612 --> 26:53.947
...I guess would do it. I suppose.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.618
I believe in you, Gale.

26:59.286 --> 27:03.373
I know that when the time comes,
you will be ready.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.014
What's up?

27:26.188 --> 27:28.315
Walt, is there...?

27:33.737 --> 27:37.866
Any particular trick
to purging the catalyst bed?

27:40.202 --> 27:44.915
No, it's pretty straightforward.
I'll show you when we get there.

28:10.816 --> 28:12.484
Yeah?

28:12.901 --> 28:14.945
Tell him I'm in conference.

28:22.953 --> 28:26.164
- I'm in conference.
- I'm looking to find a client of yours.

28:26.373 --> 28:29.084
I was hoping you could help me out
with an address.

28:29.293 --> 28:32.421
- Which client?
- Jesse Pinkman.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.716
Jesse-Pinkman-in-the-phone-book
Jesse Pinkman.

28:35.924 --> 28:39.428
How would one track him down,
I wonder.

28:42.472 --> 28:45.475
- You're still here.
- I need your full attention, Saul.

28:45.976 --> 28:47.811
Jesse Pinkman.
Current whereabouts.

28:48.020 --> 28:51.690
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you get back to whatever this is.

28:51.899 --> 28:55.152
What am I, an 8th-grade hall monitor?
Current whereabouts.

28:55.360 --> 29:00.490
- Let me tell you something, Mike, you...
- Whoa, you are good right there.

29:00.908 --> 29:03.827
Now, let's both get comfortable.

29:07.623 --> 29:09.917
Now, when I say,
I'm looking for Pinkman...

29:10.125 --> 29:12.419
...we both know why, don't we?

29:12.628 --> 29:18.050
You pretending otherwise only wastes
my time and serves to annoy me.

29:18.342 --> 29:19.718
Look, Mike...

29:19.927 --> 29:22.638
...there are rules to this lawyer thing.

29:22.846 --> 29:24.890
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

29:25.098 --> 29:27.434
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

29:27.643 --> 29:29.770
That's something I provide for you.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.813
So if I give up Pinkman...

29:32.022 --> 29:35.484
...then you're gonna be asking,
"Saul gives them up pretty easy.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.237
What's to keep him
from giving me up?" You see?

29:38.445 --> 29:40.364
So then, where's the trust?

29:41.323 --> 29:44.993
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

29:46.537 --> 29:49.665
Yeah, that's an argument.

29:49.998 --> 29:51.834
Saul...

29:52.167 --> 29:56.296
...don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

29:56.755 --> 30:00.801
Now tell me where to find him.
You know it's the right thing.

30:05.514 --> 30:09.351
I can't tell you, Mike, all right? I...

30:10.394 --> 30:15.524
Look, if I was to tell you, well, I just...
I couldn't live with myself.

30:15.732 --> 30:17.401
I'm sorry.

30:19.736 --> 30:23.365
But who's to say I didn't write
the address down in my day planner?

30:23.574 --> 30:27.035
Or on a scratch piece of paper
somewhere?

30:27.578 --> 30:30.163
Who's to say
I didn't write down a location...

30:30.372 --> 30:33.667
...strictly for
my own professional use?

30:35.252 --> 30:38.964
Do not touch anything on my desk.

30:39.173 --> 30:43.135
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a Nescafé.

30:59.985 --> 31:04.072
I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
Like a mother hen.

31:05.115 --> 31:09.411
Money-laundering ain't what it used
to be. God, do I miss the... 80s.

31:09.995 --> 31:13.874
You're wasting your time.
I'm buying the car wash, end of story.

31:14.082 --> 31:17.836
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so...

31:34.102 --> 31:38.398
Was I right? Where... else you gonna find
a cash-only business that's this fun?

31:38.607 --> 31:43.612
Unless we're talking massage parlors,
and, I don't see it. Shall we?

31:51.078 --> 31:53.830
You ever actually play laser tag?

31:54.414 --> 31:58.085
You know, it's good cardio.
Plus, you get to shoot at kids.

32:06.885 --> 32:09.555
You got your bumper cars over there
down that way.

32:09.763 --> 32:12.432
Got your arcade here,
all the latest video games.

32:12.599 --> 32:16.562
Snack bar's there. Nothing stopping
you from selling beer to the parents.

32:16.770 --> 32:21.900
- That's a whole new revenue stream...
- All right, already. We're good.

32:23.235 --> 32:24.778
Holy Christ.

32:24.987 --> 32:28.031
We're good? This constitutes good
where you're from?

32:28.240 --> 32:31.034
- My car is bugged?
- I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.

32:31.243 --> 32:34.413
I'm being followed?
What the hell have you gotten me into?

32:34.621 --> 32:38.458
My own PI is threatening to break
my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum...

32:38.667 --> 32:41.837
...threatening that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

32:42.045 --> 32:45.382
Over and above.
Service-wise, this is over and above.

32:45.591 --> 32:47.509
You and I survive this...

32:47.718 --> 32:50.179
...I'm seriously rethinking
my pricing, yeah.

32:50.387 --> 32:53.515
And that goes double for you,
Hip-Hop.

32:53.891 --> 32:55.559
Okay, my guy's no dummy, right?

32:55.767 --> 33:00.105
I give us maybe 24 hours before he
figures out that address goes nowhere.

33:00.314 --> 33:02.983
You guys do your thing,
make it snappy.

33:03.192 --> 33:06.570
I'll go see if they have "Tetris"
or something.

33:14.119 --> 33:16.288
So how you holding up?

33:19.166 --> 33:20.792
You?

33:21.418 --> 33:23.337
I got my old job back.

33:23.545 --> 33:26.840
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

33:27.049 --> 33:31.678
- So he's their boy, huh?
- He's their boy.

33:31.887 --> 33:34.264
How long you think you've got?

33:35.599 --> 33:39.603
Well, he asks a lot of questions
about the cooking process.

33:39.811 --> 33:43.941
I try to be as vague as possible,
but I got that guy Victor watching me...

33:44.149 --> 33:46.693
...listening to every word I say.

33:47.277 --> 33:52.199
You know, maybe that the only thing
saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.

33:52.407 --> 33:57.329
And once he feels confident
that he knows my entire method...

34:02.876 --> 34:04.795
So, what do we do?

34:08.590 --> 34:10.801
You know what we do.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.937
There's got to be some other way.

34:23.605 --> 34:27.276
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

34:27.484 --> 34:32.698
All right? I mean,
I can't believe I'm saying that and all...

34:32.906 --> 34:34.867
...but for your family.

34:35.075 --> 34:39.121
The DEA would love you,
all the shit you could tell them.

34:39.329 --> 34:42.332
Federal witness protection,
that's a good deal.

34:42.541 --> 34:47.462
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.
I mean, I'll make it.

34:49.047 --> 34:52.134
We had a good run.

34:53.302 --> 34:55.345
But it's over.

34:58.140 --> 35:00.559
Never the DEA.

35:02.936 --> 35:04.646
The cook can't stop.

35:04.855 --> 35:09.151
That's the one thing I'm certain of,
production cannot stop.

35:09.359 --> 35:11.612
Gus can't afford to.

35:12.070 --> 35:15.365
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got...

35:16.783 --> 35:19.828
...then I've got leverage,
and leverage keeps me alive.

35:20.037 --> 35:23.415
It keeps you alive too.
I think I can see to that.

35:24.833 --> 35:29.129
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.

35:37.054 --> 35:42.643
I can't do it, Mr. White.

35:44.144 --> 35:46.271
Like you said, I'm...

35:47.314 --> 35:49.358
I'm not a...

35:50.901 --> 35:52.986
I can't do it.

35:58.742 --> 36:00.577
I'll do it.

36:03.288 --> 36:06.708
I'm gonna need your help.

36:06.917 --> 36:09.127
I mean,
they're watching me day and night.

36:09.336 --> 36:12.548
They never leave me alone with Gale,
not for a moment.

36:12.756 --> 36:15.342
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

36:15.926 --> 36:19.304
He's not in the phone book,
I can't find him on the Internet...

36:19.471 --> 36:23.225
...and I can't do it in the lab,
Victor's always there.

36:25.143 --> 36:27.312
But if I could just...

36:27.688 --> 36:30.482
...shake Victor,
for even an hour one night...

36:30.691 --> 36:33.068
...I think then that...

36:33.485 --> 36:35.863
I may be able...

36:38.866 --> 36:41.285
...to make it look like an accident.

36:43.620 --> 36:46.832
There's got to be some other way.

36:47.749 --> 36:49.877
I'm all ears.

36:50.210 --> 36:54.965
But when it comes down to you and me
versus him, I'm sorry.

36:55.424 --> 36:57.718
I'm truly sorry...

36:58.719 --> 37:00.971
...but it's gonna be him.

37:01.972 --> 37:05.642
Now, you are the only edge
that I've got...

37:05.809 --> 37:08.729
...as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

37:08.937 --> 37:12.274
But I need you to track him,
get me his address.

37:12.482 --> 37:14.610
And I'll do the rest.

37:21.200 --> 37:25.329
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

37:29.917 --> 37:32.252
Are you gonna save mine?

38:44.700 --> 38:45.826
<i>Yeah?</i>

38:46.034 --> 38:47.703
Please, tell me you found him.

38:47.911 --> 38:53.542
<i>6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard.
Apartment 6.</i>

38:56.795 --> 38:59.590
<i>- You there?</i>
- Yeah.

39:00.007 --> 39:04.052
6353 Juan Tabo. Number 6. Got it.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.933
- He's home?
<i>- Yep.</i>

39:10.184 --> 39:12.436
Anyone watching the place?

39:12.644 --> 39:16.148
<i>No. Looks pretty much wide-open.</i>

39:16.607 --> 39:18.609
<i>When are you gonna do it?</i>

39:22.863 --> 39:24.615
Tonight.

39:24.823 --> 39:26.950
Once it gets dark.

39:30.037 --> 39:33.248
<i>Don't do this, Mr. White.</i>

39:33.415 --> 39:37.586
<i>Please. Go to the cops.</i>

40:09.535 --> 40:10.869
We got a problem.

40:11.078 --> 40:13.789
Some kind of chemical leaking
in your lab.

40:13.997 --> 40:15.666
Better come with me.

40:19.169 --> 40:21.171
I'll follow you.

40:21.338 --> 40:25.425
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
Come on, get in the car.

41:31.450 --> 41:33.535
I don't know if it's a barrel leak...

41:33.744 --> 41:36.997
...but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

41:40.584 --> 41:42.669
After you.

41:44.713 --> 41:50.093
Walter, the sooner you figure out what
this is, the sooner we all go home.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.850
Please, don't do this.

41:57.184 --> 41:59.061
Mike...

41:59.353 --> 42:01.855
...you don't have to do this.

42:03.023 --> 42:06.026
Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter.

42:06.235 --> 42:07.819
Downstairs.

42:08.028 --> 42:12.282
I'll cook. I'll cook for free. There won't
be any more trouble, I promise you.

42:12.491 --> 42:14.117
- No.
- If I could talk to Gus...

42:14.326 --> 42:16.161
- No.
- ...I can make him understand.

42:16.370 --> 42:18.664
If I could talk to Gus,
I can convince him.

42:18.872 --> 42:20.707
Just let me, please... Please.

42:20.916 --> 42:24.670
- Please, let me talk to him.
- Shut up! Shut up.

42:25.921 --> 42:29.675
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

42:33.053 --> 42:34.930
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

42:35.138 --> 42:38.600
Like you said, he's the problem.
He's always been the problem.

42:38.809 --> 42:42.563
And without him, we would...
And he's in town, all right?

42:42.771 --> 42:45.482
He's not in Virginia
or wherever you're looking.

42:45.691 --> 42:48.944
He's right here in Albuquerque
and I could take you to him.

42:49.152 --> 42:51.488
I'll take you right to him.

42:54.533 --> 42:56.159
- What do you say?
- Where is he?

42:56.368 --> 43:00.330
- Right now, you give me an address.
- I don't... He moves. He moves around.

43:00.539 --> 43:03.250
But if you let me call him...
No, no, please.

43:03.458 --> 43:06.128
No, I just... My phone. I'll just...

43:06.336 --> 43:10.465
It's just my phone. I'll call him
and I'll have him meet me.

43:10.674 --> 43:12.843
All right? Okay?

43:13.051 --> 43:14.678
Okay?

43:54.301 --> 43:55.427
Did you do it?

43:58.222 --> 44:00.057
<i>Mr. White?</i>

44:00.307 --> 44:02.392
<i>Did you do it?</i>

44:03.018 --> 44:04.853
No, I didn't do it.

44:05.354 --> 44:07.898
<i>I can't now.</i>

44:08.690 --> 44:12.194
<i>- It's gonna have to be you.</i>
- What? No way, man.

44:12.402 --> 44:15.531
You're closer than we are.
You'll have a 20-minute lead.

44:15.739 --> 44:18.408
<i>They've got me,
they're going to kill me.</i>

44:18.534 --> 44:20.786
- Jesse, do it now! Do it!
- Son of a bitch!

44:20.994 --> 44:22.246
<i>Do it, Jesse! Do it!</i>

44:30.921 --> 44:33.173
Just what the hell was that exactly?

44:33.382 --> 44:35.133
You might wanna hold off.

44:35.342 --> 44:36.760
Yeah?

44:37.135 --> 44:40.848
