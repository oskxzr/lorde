2
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,172
- Well, hello there.
- Hi, I hope we're not too late.

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,007
- No, no. Perfect timing.
- Okay.

4
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,176
- Stan, this is my husband, Walt.
- Hi.

5
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,345
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,597
- Sandia Laboratories, huh?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,350
I hear some fascinating stuff
goes on out there.

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,143
Yeah, well, you know.

9
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,396
Working on anything
you can talk about?

10
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm picturing giant space lasers.
Am I right?

11
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,485
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

12
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:13,365
Giant space lasers? That sounds cool.
I'll bring it up at our next staff meeting.

13
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,702
- Well, just remember I get a cut.
- All right. It's a deal.

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,997
So this is it, honey. What do you say?
Wanna take a tour?

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,165
- Sure.
- Okay.

16
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,211
Look, how about
I give ya'll some privacy?

17
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,924
I'll go out to the car, make a few calls.
Take as much time as you need.

18
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,886
- All right.
- Okay, thanks.

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,141
- He's a nice guy. He doesn't push.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:43,979
So as you can see,
there's this kind of flow going on here.

21
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,064
- It's a nice big living room.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,985
And this is the dining area.

23
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:54,489
- Oh, the dining area. Right.
- Yes. Oh, and...

24
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,617
...it's got a pool.

25
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,494
Pool is nice.

26
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,456
Backyard could be a little bigger.

27
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:07,669
And... Oh, there's a breakfast bar
kind of dealie here, which is nice.

28
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,797
And, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious...

29
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,842
...and, you know,
got good appliances and...

30
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,761
How many bedrooms?

31
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,846
Three. Told you.

32
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:22,142
They're all pretty good size and...
Oh, this is the first one here.

33
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,770
And then there's two more
at the back.

34
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,939
Only three bedrooms?

35
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,858
We're gonna need at least five,
don't you think?

36
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,568
- Five?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,446
What, do I look like
I'm about to drop a litter?

38
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:39,993
No, no, no.
We'll have three kids total, eventually.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,746
Yeah, but we'll need
a spare room for a study...

40
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,083
...so that I can work at home
and you can write.

41
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:51,088
Yeah, no.
I don't think this is gonna be... enough.

42
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,217
Okay, what about a wine cellar?

43
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,221
I mean, we certainly cannot be
expected to live without a wine cellar.

44
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,433
Very funny. I just think we need
to set our sights high is all.

45
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:08,564
- At least, higher than here.
- Walt, this is a good neighbourhood.

46
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,900
It's got a good elementary
and a very good high school...

47
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:17,072
...and believe me, because I have
definitely looked everywhere.

48
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,992
For our price range,
this is as good as it gets.

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,161
Well, then let's stretch our price range.

50
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,038
Truly. I mean, why...?

51
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:29,418
Why buy a starter house when we'll
have to move out in a year or two?

52
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,962
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

53
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,964
I'm serious.

54
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,593
Come on. Why be cautious?

55
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,679
We've got nowhere to go but up.

56
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,274
- Yeah.
<i>- Walter, you see us?</i>

57
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,984
Yeah. I see you.

58
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:04,114
<i>I'd like you to exit your vehicle
and start walking toward us.</i>

59
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:08,160
And then what?
I'm gonna need some...

60
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,455
Some kind of assurance.

61
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,625
<i>I assure you,
I could kill you from way over here...</i>

62
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,503
<i>...if it makes you feel any better.</i>

63
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,310
Walter, you've been busy.

64
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,314
You wanna put your arms out
to your sides for me, if you would?

65
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,125
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

66
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,295
I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

67
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,297
I need my sleep.

68
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,551
You said no half measures.

69
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,390
Yeah. Funny how words can be so open
to interpretation.

70
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,561
- You get your car fixed?
- Not yet.

71
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,063
You're gonna wanna
get your car fixed.

72
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,150
Let's see how this goes first.

73
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,020
Has your condition worsened?

74
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,065
- Excuse me?
- Your medical condition.

75
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:46,151
- Has it grown worse?
- Not that I know of, no.

76
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,946
Is there a ringing in your ears?

77
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,657
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

78
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:57,621
- I'm quite well, thank you.
- No. Clearly, you are not.

79
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:01,166
No rational person would do
as you have done.

80
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,212
Explain yourself.

81
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,218
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

82
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,886
I intervened.

83
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,514
Some worthless junkie.

84
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,809
For him, you intervened
and put us all at risk.

85
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,813
Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
keep the peace for eight hours.

86
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,440
That's right. He couldn't.

87
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,151
He was angry because those
two dealers of yours...

88
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,487
...had just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

89
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,531
I heard about it.

90
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,492
He should have
let me take care of them.

91
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,411
Maybe.

92
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,748
Then again, maybe he thought
it was you who gave the order.

93
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:50,340
Are you asking me
if I ordered the murder of a child?

94
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,636
I would never ask you that.

95
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,060
Where is Pinkman now?

96
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,273
I wouldn't know.

97
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,985
Couple of time zones away, at least.

98
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,572
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.

99
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,202
He has enough money to last forever,
he knows he needs to keep moving.

100
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,953
You'll never find him.

101
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,039
I don't know, Walt...

102
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,417
...it's what I do, after all.

103
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,421
He's out of the picture.

104
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,675
I saved his life, I owed him that,
but now he and I are done.

105
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,054
Which is exactly what you wanted,
isn't it?

106
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,020
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man.

107
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:48,690
So if I may,
I would like to review options with you.

108
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,778
Of which, it seems to me,
you have two.

109
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,947
Option A:

110
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,990
You kill me right here and now.

111
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,118
Apparently,
I have made that very easy for you.

112
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,913
You can kill me, no witnesses...

113
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,917
...and then spend the next few weeks
or months...

114
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,920
...tracking down Jesse Pinkman
and you kill him too.

115
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,508
A pointless exercise, it seems to me,
but that is option A.

116
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,343
What is option B?

117
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,928
I continue cooking.

118
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,973
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

119
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,433
We forget this ever happened.

120
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,311
We consider this a lone hiccup...

121
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:31,275
...in an otherwise long
and fruitful business arrangement.

122
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,404
I prefer option B.

123
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,246
You'd need a new assistant.

124
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,666
- I could get right on that.
- No.

125
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,085
This time, I choose.

126
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,936
Your car...

127
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,813
...get it fixed.

128
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,565
Yeah.

129
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,814
Really?

130
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,927
It's good to see you.

131
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,389
Thanks.

132
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,600
It's good to be back.

133
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,478
Well, shall we?

134
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:35,649
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

135
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,245
What about that rhinoceros?
You think he'd make a good pet?

136
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,038
- No.
- No?

137
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,916
Don't you think if you called,
he'd come running?

138
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,086
I bet he would.
I bet he'd come running:

139
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,088
You're silly, Pop-Pop.

140
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:01,341
Well, a little. But he'd probably
knock everything over.

141
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,138
- Plus, there's that big nose of his.
- That's not a nose, that's a horn.

142
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,517
- Is that so?
- His real nose is little.

143
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,022
I learn all kinds of things
being with you.

144
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,235
Okay, June bug, these are for you.

145
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,738
- What about the rest?
- The rest are for me.

146
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,449
No, they're not.
You're too old for balloons.

147
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,079
You're never too old for balloons.
Give me a hug.

148
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,540
I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.

149
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,210
- Bye, Pop-Pop.
- Bye, baby.

150
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,546
Hi, sweetie.
Did you have fun with Pop-Pop?

151
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,100
What do you think?

152
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
There is only one way
to find out...

153
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
- What is that?
- I don't know.

154
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,047
Please. Please, no.

155
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,669
Chow, you have anything
you wanna tell me?

156
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,589
Thank God you're here.
They keep me prisoner.

157
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,676
- They keep you prisoner.
- I don't do nothing for them ever.

158
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:16,013
They try and make me. I say, no.

159
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:21,310
They steal my chemicals.
I can't stop them. I am businessman.

160
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,021
You're a business...
The lady out front...

161
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,774
Hey, lady, are you still there?
Ask her if she's still there.

162
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,124
She says, yes.

163
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,046
How's her driving? Driving.
Is she good behind the wheel?

164
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,673
Good. She's good driver.

165
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,551
Licensed? Dependable?

166
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,053
She has a Camry.

167
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,804
Good.

168
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,853
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

169
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:08,857
I strongly recommend
that you return our calls next time.

170
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,235
So have her drive you to the hospital.

171
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,492
She's gonna need her shoe.

172
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:32,214
- Where'd they cross?
- Laredo, looks like.

173
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,092
They didn't exactly send
their A players.

174
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:38,262
But like you said, it's cartel, all right.

175
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,391
Probing for weakness.

176
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,186
Well, they didn't find any.

177
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,066
What about Pinkman?

178
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,570
I'm making inquiries.

179
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:14,214
Yeah, that's two.
All right, let's close it up.

180
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,640
All right, bring it down.

181
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,393
You ready?

182
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,192
Okay, we're good.

183
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,366
You can take your mask off now.

184
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,253
Does that guy ever leave?

185
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:59,134
When exactly did that start?

186
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,553
It's new.

187
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,223
We had a...

188
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:08,977
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

189
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,439
- Sorry to hear that.
- No, it'll be fine.

190
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:15,859
Things will continue
to smooth out and...

191
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,403
Yeah, it'll be fine.

192
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:25,410
By the way, if you're at all worried
about working with me...

193
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,496
No, I'm not.

194
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,748
Whatever my shortcomings
last time...

195
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:33,210
...I intend for things to go perfectly
from here on out.

196
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:37,005
- So if there is...?
- Gale, you're great.

197
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,883
- Seriously.
- I just...

198
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:45,180
However you like things to be done
is exactly how we're gonna do them.

199
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,224
Period.

200
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,936
From here on out, so...

201
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,606
Please, teach me.

202
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,990
Okay.

203
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,324
Gale. It's good to see you.

204
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,159
Mr. Fring.

205
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,953
Wow, this is...

206
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,414
I should have called.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

207
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:38,627
No. No, no, not at all.
Please, come in.

208
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,090
Can I offer you something?
A crème de menthe?

209
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,968
No. No, thank you.

210
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,679
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

211
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:53,058
Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.

212
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,062
I need to talk to you
about something.

213
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,690
Something rather pressing.

214
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,572
If push came to shove,
I was wondering...

215
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,659
...how soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

216
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:13,036
You and an assistant.

217
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,455
Why would...?

218
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:20,878
- Why would push come to shove?
- Has Walter ever talked to you...

219
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:24,673
...about why he got into
this particular line of work?

220
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:29,261
I guess I assumed
it was because it pays so well.

221
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:32,097
It is, but specifically...

222
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:35,225
...has he... ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

223
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:42,274
I'm not surprised.
He's a very private person.

224
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,777
What exactly
are his health problems?

225
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,197
He's dying of cancer.

226
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:53,660
It is why he does this, to provide for
his family, which he's accomplished.

227
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:58,040
They will never want for anything,
he's seen to that.

228
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:03,795
How long does he have?

229
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:08,091
That is very much the question.

230
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:12,638
He does not wanna talk about it.
And every time I bring it up with him...

231
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:19,353
I don't know that he's fully accepted
the reality of it.

232
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:24,316
And not to sound cold-blooded,
but I am running a business here.

233
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:29,530
- No, I understand.
- I have a very large investment in this.

234
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:32,866
There's so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down.

235
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:34,451
Not even for a week.

236
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,038
So you understand my concern.

237
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:41,291
And my desire for continuity.

238
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,918
I do. Absolutely.

239
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:47,339
Now, I intend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants...

240
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:51,426
...assuming that
he's physically up to it.

241
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:57,349
But as he cannot or will not tell me
how long that might be...

242
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:02,396
...I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

243
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,691
Well, worst-case scenario...

244
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,950
I suppose if we had...

245
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,412
...at least a few more cooks together.

246
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,748
You don't think you're ready now?

247
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,126
Well, I mean...

248
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,837
...he is such a...

249
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,214
A master.

250
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,676
There's always more for me to learn.

251
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:39,683
But I'm thinking that if we had...

252
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,602
...say...

253
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,062
...one or two more cooks.

254
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,903
One more...

255
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,947
...I guess would do it. I suppose.

256
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,618
I believe in you, Gale.

257
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:03,373
I know that when the time comes,
you will be ready.

258
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,014
What's up?

259
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:28,315
Walt, is there...?

260
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:37,866
Any particular trick
to purging the catalyst bed?

261
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:44,915
No, it's pretty straightforward.
I'll show you when we get there.

262
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,484
Yeah?

263
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,945
Tell him I'm in conference.

264
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:26,164
- I'm in conference.
- I'm looking to find a client of yours.

265
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:29,084
I was hoping you could help me out
with an address.

266
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:32,421
- Which client?
- Jesse Pinkman.

267
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,716
Jesse-Pinkman-in-the-phone-book
Jesse Pinkman.

268
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:39,428
How would one track him down,
I wonder.

269
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,475
- You're still here.
- I need your full attention, Saul.

270
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:47,811
Jesse Pinkman.
Current whereabouts.

271
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,690
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you get back to whatever this is.

272
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:55,152
What am I, an 8th-grade hall monitor?
Current whereabouts.

273
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,490
- Let me tell you something, Mike, you...
- Whoa, you are good right there.

274
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:03,827
Now, let's both get comfortable.

275
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,917
Now, when I say,
I'm looking for Pinkman...

276
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,419
...we both know why, don't we?

277
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:18,050
You pretending otherwise only wastes
my time and serves to annoy me.

278
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:19,718
Look, Mike...

279
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,638
...there are rules to this lawyer thing.

280
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,890
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

281
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,434
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

282
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,770
That's something I provide for you.

283
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:31,813
So if I give up Pinkman...

284
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:35,484
...then you're gonna be asking,
"Saul gives them up pretty easy.

285
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,237
What's to keep him
from giving me up?" You see?

286
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,364
So then, where's the trust?

287
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:44,993
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

288
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:49,665
Yeah, that's an argument.

289
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,834
Saul...

290
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:56,296
...don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

291
00:29:56,755 --> 00:30:00,801
Now tell me where to find him.
You know it's the right thing.

292
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:09,351
I can't tell you, Mike, all right? I...

293
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:15,524
Look, if I was to tell you, well, I just...
I couldn't live with myself.

294
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,401
I'm sorry.

295
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:23,365
But who's to say I didn't write
the address down in my day planner?

296
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:27,035
Or on a scratch piece of paper
somewhere?

297
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:30,163
Who's to say
I didn't write down a location...

298
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,667
...strictly for
my own professional use?

299
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:38,964
Do not touch anything on my desk.

300
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:43,135
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a Nescafé.

301
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:04,072
I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
Like a mother hen.

302
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:09,411
Money-laundering ain't what it used
to be. God, do I miss the... 80s.

303
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:13,874
You're wasting your time.
I'm buying the car wash, end of story.

304
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:17,836
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so...

305
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:38,398
Was I right? Where... else you gonna find
a cash-only business that's this fun?

306
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:43,612
Unless we're talking massage parlors,
and, I don't see it. Shall we?

307
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,830
You ever actually play laser tag?

308
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:58,085
You know, it's good cardio.
Plus, you get to shoot at kids.

309
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:09,555
You got your bumper cars over there
down that way.

310
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:12,432
Got your arcade here,
all the latest video games.

311
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,562
Snack bar's there. Nothing stopping
you from selling beer to the parents.

312
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:21,900
- That's a whole new revenue stream...
- All right, already. We're good.

313
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:24,778
Holy Christ.

314
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:28,031
We're good? This constitutes good
where you're from?

315
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,034
- My car is bugged?
- I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.

316
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:34,413
I'm being followed?
What the hell have you gotten me into?

317
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:38,458
My own PI is threatening to break
my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum...

318
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,837
...threatening that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

319
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:45,382
Over and above.
Service-wise, this is over and above.

320
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:47,509
You and I survive this...

321
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:50,179
...I'm seriously rethinking
my pricing, yeah.

322
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,515
And that goes double for you,
Hip-Hop.

323
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:55,559
Okay, my guy's no dummy, right?

324
00:32:55,767 --> 00:33:00,105
I give us maybe 24 hours before he
figures out that address goes nowhere.

325
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:02,983
You guys do your thing,
make it snappy.

326
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:06,570
I'll go see if they have "Tetris"
or something.

327
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,288
So how you holding up?

328
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,792
You?

329
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:23,337
I got my old job back.

330
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:26,840
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

331
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:31,678
- So he's their boy, huh?
- He's their boy.

332
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,264
How long you think you've got?

333
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,603
Well, he asks a lot of questions
about the cooking process.

334
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:43,941
I try to be as vague as possible,
but I got that guy Victor watching me...

335
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:46,693
...listening to every word I say.

336
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:52,199
You know, maybe that the only thing
saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.

337
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:57,329
And once he feels confident
that he knows my entire method...

338
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,795
So, what do we do?

339
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,801
You know what we do.

340
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:21,937
There's got to be some other way.

341
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:27,276
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

342
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:32,698
All right? I mean,
I can't believe I'm saying that and all...

343
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,867
...but for your family.

344
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:39,121
The DEA would love you,
all the shit you could tell them.

345
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:42,332
Federal witness protection,
that's a good deal.

346
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:47,462
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.
I mean, I'll make it.

347
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:52,134
We had a good run.

348
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:55,345
But it's over.

349
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,559
Never the DEA.

350
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,646
The cook can't stop.

351
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:09,151
That's the one thing I'm certain of,
production cannot stop.

352
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,612
Gus can't afford to.

353
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,365
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got...

354
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,828
...then I've got leverage,
and leverage keeps me alive.

355
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:23,415
It keeps you alive too.
I think I can see to that.

356
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:29,129
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.

357
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:42,643
I can't do it, Mr. White.

358
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,271
Like you said, I'm...

359
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,358
I'm not a...

360
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:52,986
I can't do it.

361
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:00,577
I'll do it.

362
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:06,708
I'm gonna need your help.

363
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,127
I mean,
they're watching me day and night.

364
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:12,548
They never leave me alone with Gale,
not for a moment.

365
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:15,342
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

366
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:19,304
He's not in the phone book,
I can't find him on the Internet...

367
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:23,225
...and I can't do it in the lab,
Victor's always there.

368
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,312
But if I could just...

369
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:30,482
...shake Victor,
for even an hour one night...

370
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,068
...I think then that...

371
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,863
I may be able...

372
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:41,285
...to make it look like an accident.

373
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,832
There's got to be some other way.

374
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,877
I'm all ears.

375
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:54,965
But when it comes down to you and me
versus him, I'm sorry.

376
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,718
I'm truly sorry...

377
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,971
...but it's gonna be him.

378
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:05,642
Now, you are the only edge
that I've got...

379
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,729
...as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

380
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:12,274
But I need you to track him,
get me his address.

381
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,610
And I'll do the rest.

382
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,329
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

383
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,252
Are you gonna save mine?

384
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,826
<i>Yeah?</i>

385
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,703
Please, tell me you found him.

386
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:53,542
<i>6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard.
Apartment 6.</i>

387
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,590
<i>- You there?</i>
- Yeah.

388
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:04,052
6353 Juan Tabo. Number 6. Got it.

389
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,933
- He's home?
<i>- Yep.</i>

390
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,436
Anyone watching the place?

391
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:16,148
<i>No. Looks pretty much wide-open.</i>

392
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,609
<i>When are you gonna do it?</i>

393
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:24,615
Tonight.

394
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:26,950
Once it gets dark.

395
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,248
<i>Don't do this, Mr. White.</i>

396
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:37,586
<i>Please. Go to the cops.</i>

397
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:10,869
We got a problem.

398
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,789
Some kind of chemical leaking
in your lab.

399
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,666
Better come with me.

400
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:21,171
I'll follow you.

401
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:25,425
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
Come on, get in the car.

402
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,535
I don't know if it's a barrel leak...

403
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:36,997
...but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

404
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,669
After you.

405
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:50,093
Walter, the sooner you figure out what
this is, the sooner we all go home.

406
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,850
Please, don't do this.

407
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:59,061
Mike...

408
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:01,855
...you don't have to do this.

409
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:06,026
Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter.

410
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,819
Downstairs.

411
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:12,282
I'll cook. I'll cook for free. There won't
be any more trouble, I promise you.

412
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,117
- No.
- If I could talk to Gus...

413
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:16,161
- No.
- ...I can make him understand.

414
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,664
If I could talk to Gus,
I can convince him.

415
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,707
Just let me, please... Please.

416
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:24,670
- Please, let me talk to him.
- Shut up! Shut up.

417
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:29,675
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

418
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:34,930
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

419
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:38,600
Like you said, he's the problem.
He's always been the problem.

420
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:42,563
And without him, we would...
And he's in town, all right?

421
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,482
He's not in Virginia
or wherever you're looking.

422
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,944
He's right here in Albuquerque
and I could take you to him.

423
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,488
I'll take you right to him.

424
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,159
- What do you say?
- Where is he?

425
00:42:56,368 --> 00:43:00,330
- Right now, you give me an address.
- I don't... He moves. He moves around.

426
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:03,250
But if you let me call him...
No, no, please.

427
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,128
No, I just... My phone. I'll just...

428
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:10,465
It's just my phone. I'll call him
and I'll have him meet me.

429
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,843
All right? Okay?

430
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,678
Okay?

431
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,427
Did you do it?

432
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:00,057
<i>Mr. White?</i>

433
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,392
<i>Did you do it?</i>

434
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,853
No, I didn't do it.

435
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:07,898
<i>I can't now.</i>

436
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,194
<i>- It's gonna have to be you.</i>
- What? No way, man.

437
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:15,531
You're closer than we are.
You'll have a 20-minute lead.

438
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:18,408
<i>They've got me,
they're going to kill me.</i>

439
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,786
- Jesse, do it now! Do it!
- Son of a bitch!

440
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:22,246
<i>Do it, Jesse! Do it!</i>

441
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:33,173
Just what the hell was that exactly?

442
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,133
You might wanna hold off.

443
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:36,760
Yeah?

444
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:40,848
- Why?
- Because your boss is gonna need me.

445
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:47,688
6353 Juan Tabo, Apartment 6.

446
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:52,317
Yeah.

447
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,283
Hi. How can I help you?

448
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:50,125
Take whatever you want.

449
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,754
I have money. I have...

450
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:56,548
I got a lot of money.

451
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:59,176
I have...

452
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,895
Please, don't do this.

453
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,649
You don't... You...

454
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:20,322
You... You don't have to do this.
