00:13.072 --> 00:14.103
More.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.154
Another.

00:28.211 --> 00:30.287
Hot day like today...

00:30.463 --> 00:32.622
...too much oil in the machine...

00:33.425 --> 00:35.334
...can cause it to blow a gasket.

00:37.095 --> 00:40.380
There are two kinds of men
in this world.

00:41.098 --> 00:42.213
Those who drink...

00:42.391 --> 00:44.300
...and those who pour.

00:45.519 --> 00:47.476
Shut up and fill my glass.

00:57.531 --> 00:59.903
Hey, you two.

01:00.492 --> 01:01.523
Yes, you.

01:02.494 --> 01:04.285
I used to be just like you.

01:04.621 --> 01:07.824
Worked dirt for the man
till my hands bled.

01:08.583 --> 01:09.698
But no more.

01:10.251 --> 01:14.331
Because I learned that a man
can never drink his fill...

01:14.922 --> 01:16.582
...by waiting in line for the tap.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.331
Listen to him.

01:19.885 --> 01:21.261
He can teach you something!

01:24.473 --> 01:26.929
Hey, how you doing, boss?

01:30.020 --> 01:33.104
Good to see you, my friend.

01:33.815 --> 01:37.480
You know, I never pegged you
for such a deep thinker.

01:37.944 --> 01:39.771
I keep thinking I should write a book.

01:39.946 --> 01:42.022
Maybe, maybe...

01:44.909 --> 01:49.286
So, what brings you to this
burro's asshole of a town?

01:49.622 --> 01:51.745
I knew I would find you here.

01:54.377 --> 01:56.702
Don't you have something to deliver?

01:57.379 --> 01:58.874
Cutting it close, aren't you?

02:00.424 --> 02:02.630
Lots of time.

02:03.302 --> 02:08.129
Tortuga may be slow out of the gate,
but he always...

02:08.348 --> 02:09.593
Finishes first.

02:09.933 --> 02:12.056
Yes, I know.
Just like your namesake.

02:12.477 --> 02:15.561
I like the way you talk, Tortuga.

02:15.730 --> 02:17.474
Yeah?

02:17.649 --> 02:20.140
You've got such a way with words.

02:20.568 --> 02:24.518
They flow like a waterfall.

02:25.072 --> 02:26.401
I like that about you.

02:31.954 --> 02:36.616
I'm so stupid.
I missed your birthday.

02:37.292 --> 02:38.751
No, I feel terrible.

02:38.919 --> 02:42.454
So bad I came all the way here
to this burro's asshole...

02:42.673 --> 02:44.250
...to give you your present.

02:44.466 --> 02:45.497
Present?

02:45.675 --> 02:48.593
Come on, boss.
No need to go through the trouble.

02:48.803 --> 02:51.010
Forget it, I wanted to.

02:52.557 --> 02:54.099
I have it for you in the back.

02:56.686 --> 02:59.011
- Back there?
- Yes. Come. Follow me.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.118
It's perfect!

03:15.662 --> 03:17.038
Do you really like it?

03:19.124 --> 03:20.998
I love it!

03:21.168 --> 03:23.374
What a great pet it will make.

03:23.587 --> 03:24.915
Thank you, boss!

03:25.130 --> 03:26.505
Excellent.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.129
Let me sign it for you.

03:29.717 --> 03:30.832
Let me sign it...

03:33.054 --> 03:38.048
..."For the big talker."

04:38.032 --> 04:40.191
He's still breathing.

04:40.743 --> 04:43.910
Well, by the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

04:45.331 --> 04:48.914
I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

04:49.919 --> 04:52.125
Mum's the word.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.205
Son of a bitch.

05:48.558 --> 05:50.432
Hang on, baby.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.613
<i>Hello.</i>

06:03.989 --> 06:05.733
Walt? Are you in the house?

06:08.035 --> 06:11.285
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.661
What? What the hell
are you doing in there?

06:16.293 --> 06:17.372
I'm back.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.165
No, no, you're not back, Walt.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.090
You're not back.
Get... Get out of there.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.499
- Well, it's my house too, Skyler.
- No...

06:25.677 --> 06:28.594
I'm staying. End of story.

06:29.013 --> 06:32.180
- We had an agreement.
- I didn't agree to anything.

06:32.350 --> 06:35.516
Now, look, just come on inside
and we'll talk this through, okay?

06:35.686 --> 06:38.603
No. No. There's nothing to talk about.

06:38.772 --> 06:43.233
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

06:44.111 --> 06:47.859
Well, suit yourself.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.734
Walt.

06:49.908 --> 06:51.402
Walt?

07:16.100 --> 07:18.591
What is wrong with you?

07:18.769 --> 07:23.181
- Skyler, I have... every right to be here.
- No, you don't.

07:23.357 --> 07:26.642
You don't live here anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

07:26.818 --> 07:29.523
- I don't agree to a divorce.
- Well, it's not up to you.

07:32.282 --> 07:35.900
If you don't get out of here right now,
I'm gonna call the police...

07:36.077 --> 07:39.695
...and I'm going to tell them
everything.

07:39.872 --> 07:42.541
I mean it, Walt.

07:45.711 --> 07:47.668
There's the phone.

08:06.106 --> 08:07.849
It's ringing.

08:12.528 --> 08:14.070
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.</i>

08:14.238 --> 08:17.488
<i>Operator number 314.
How may I help you?</i>

08:18.993 --> 08:22.658
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.
How may I help you?</i>

08:23.038 --> 08:27.499
Yes, I want to report a disturbance,
please.

08:28.460 --> 08:32.540
No, no, it's not...
It's not exactly, it's...

08:33.632 --> 08:36.419
It's a domestic issue.

08:37.052 --> 08:38.546
Okay.

08:42.182 --> 08:43.724
They're connecting me.

08:45.685 --> 08:48.258
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

08:48.438 --> 08:50.975
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

08:52.024 --> 08:55.523
This family is everything to me.

08:55.778 --> 09:00.404
- Without it, I have nothing to lose.
- Fine.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.699
Yes. My name is Skyler White.

09:05.871 --> 09:08.872
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

09:09.040 --> 09:14.710
My soon-to-be... ex-husband
broke into my house...

09:14.879 --> 09:18.497
...and I need an officer to come
and remove him.

09:20.218 --> 09:23.503
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

09:25.097 --> 09:28.715
Okay. Okay.

09:30.895 --> 09:32.555
Thank you.

09:38.235 --> 09:39.978
They're coming.

10:29.617 --> 10:31.159
- Dad's here?
- Great, he's home.

10:31.327 --> 10:33.485
- Dad.
- Hey, son.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.407
How are you?

10:35.915 --> 10:38.584
Are you back for good?

10:38.751 --> 10:43.413
- Why are you home so soon?
- I'm not.

10:44.798 --> 10:47.550
Hey, I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

10:47.718 --> 10:48.998
- Sure.
- You want one too?

10:49.177 --> 10:52.344
Walter, your dad and I
have something we need to discuss.

10:52.514 --> 10:56.013
When your sandwich is ready,
I'll bring it to your room.

10:56.226 --> 11:01.351
Mom, can't it wait?
I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever.

11:01.523 --> 11:03.065
- Walter?
- How was school?

11:03.233 --> 11:05.024
- It was good.
- Yeah? Homework?

11:05.193 --> 11:08.443
- No, not really.
- Not really? What does that mean?

11:18.247 --> 11:20.619
So are you gonna be
at work tomorrow?

11:20.791 --> 11:23.033
Yeah, that's the plan.

11:37.307 --> 11:39.632
Hello, ma'am.
We were called about a disturbance?

11:39.809 --> 11:44.020
It's more of a trespassing situation,
really, but...

11:45.147 --> 11:46.642
Yeah, that was me.

11:47.608 --> 11:51.273
You called the cops on Dad?

11:55.991 --> 11:58.233
I came home from work
and he was back.

11:58.410 --> 12:00.735
He had just moved back
into the house.

12:00.912 --> 12:07.164
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen. I just...

12:07.544 --> 12:11.244
I want him out.
I want him out of the house.

12:11.422 --> 12:14.874
Okay, Mrs. White, there's a couple
questions I need to ask you.

12:15.051 --> 12:16.925
It's very important
you answer honestly.

12:17.136 --> 12:20.054
- Did he strike you?
- No.

12:20.223 --> 12:24.386
- Has he... ever hit you?
- No. This is not about violence.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.718
This is about trespassing.

12:26.896 --> 12:31.688
- About him being here against my will.
- Okay. Trespassing.

12:31.859 --> 12:35.477
- You're divorced, then?
- No, working on it.

12:36.279 --> 12:39.316
- Right now, were separated.
- Legally separated?

12:39.491 --> 12:41.946
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean.

12:42.118 --> 12:45.986
But we've been living apart
for almost two weeks, give or take.

12:46.164 --> 12:49.746
I changed the locks.
Isn't that breaking and entering?

12:49.917 --> 12:51.791
Whose name is on the title
to the house?

12:51.961 --> 12:55.294
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

12:55.464 --> 12:58.038
We can't arrest a man for breaking
into his own house.

12:58.217 --> 13:00.708
Not without a court order
requiring he stays away.

13:00.886 --> 13:02.795
Unless he's threatened you
or the kids.

13:02.972 --> 13:08.926
No. Not physically.
But having him in the house is just...

13:09.603 --> 13:14.015
It's not a good thing. Excuse me.

13:15.609 --> 13:20.650
I got her, honey.
Come here. Here we go.

13:20.822 --> 13:25.448
You hungry? You hungry?
Here we go.

13:26.744 --> 13:28.025
That was it.

13:28.830 --> 13:32.744
- I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?
- Disagreements.

13:32.917 --> 13:36.582
Yes, well, we've had our share of that.

13:37.546 --> 13:42.124
I haven't... I haven't been
the most attentive husband lately.

13:44.678 --> 13:49.090
Mrs. White, would this be... easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

13:51.893 --> 13:58.774
No. Nope. I'm fine right here.

13:58.942 --> 14:00.484
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

14:00.651 --> 14:03.356
If you want him out of the house,
you'll have to help me.

14:04.197 --> 14:07.114
Is it possible maybe
he's broken any laws that you know of?

14:07.283 --> 14:11.530
Anything at all. Anything that
we could work with here, just tell me.

14:11.704 --> 14:14.242
Even if it's just a suspicion,
I can work with that.

14:14.415 --> 14:16.656
I'll get him out of the house for you.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.874
What's your take on all this?

14:19.044 --> 14:21.879
It's my mom's fault.

14:23.590 --> 14:29.675
She won't even say what my dad did
and it's because he didn't do anything.

14:29.846 --> 14:32.337
I don't know why
she's being this way.

14:32.515 --> 14:37.806
My dad, he is a great guy.

14:37.979 --> 14:41.727
Son, it's not your mom's fault.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.976
Mrs. White.

14:46.904 --> 14:49.477
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no legal basis...

14:49.656 --> 14:52.444
...for us to remove your husband
from the house.

14:53.952 --> 14:56.573
Next time you feel things
are getting out of control...

14:56.747 --> 15:00.281
...you should call this number.
It's the family hotline.

15:00.458 --> 15:02.747
I'd really look into
some counseling.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.963
Best of luck to you folks.

15:06.130 --> 15:08.800
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.428
Why you gotta...?
Why you gotta do this to Dad?

15:19.602 --> 15:23.646
Junior, wait, come on.
Don't blame your mother for this.

15:28.110 --> 15:29.652
Sorry.

15:47.003 --> 15:48.912
Welcome home.

16:32.212 --> 16:35.996
He lives. Happy housewarming, kid.

16:36.175 --> 16:38.547
- Don't look so glad to see me.
- Thanks.

16:39.344 --> 16:42.594
Interesting decor. It's subtle.

16:42.764 --> 16:46.098
The whole minimalist thing never
really blew my hair back, but hey.

16:47.143 --> 16:51.805
So how are you doing?
Staying clean?

16:53.358 --> 16:56.691
Good. I was kind of worried
that you were back to old habits...

16:56.861 --> 16:59.103
...since I didn't hear from you,
you know.

16:59.530 --> 17:02.697
You realize how stupid it is
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

17:02.867 --> 17:04.527
What if I was trying to warn you...

17:04.702 --> 17:08.153
...that the DEA was gonna kick down
your door? What then?

17:08.330 --> 17:11.414
Why don't you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

17:11.583 --> 17:13.706
Fair enough.
Remember the other day...

17:13.877 --> 17:17.875
...when I brought up the idea of you
getting back in touch with your partner?

17:18.048 --> 17:20.503
Well, I kind of wanted to
re-float that boat.

17:20.675 --> 17:23.249
I'm not suggesting you
yourself get back to cooking.

17:23.428 --> 17:25.255
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

17:25.430 --> 17:29.130
I only want you to convince
the master chef to do his thing.

17:29.308 --> 17:32.345
So, what do you say?

17:33.104 --> 17:35.808
- Sure, man. Whatever.
- Okay. Whatever what?

17:35.982 --> 17:38.437
I mean, you gonna call him?

17:38.609 --> 17:42.772
I said I'll handle it.
Now, bounce, will you? Please?

17:42.946 --> 17:44.820
Final thought.

17:46.033 --> 17:49.781
Look at this place. You're house-poor,
you got no bankroll.

17:49.953 --> 17:54.200
If you get the maestro cooking again,
I'll make it worth your while.

17:55.750 --> 17:56.782
Call him.

18:43.504 --> 18:46.707
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

18:46.882 --> 18:47.962
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

18:48.134 --> 18:50.707
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

19:13.491 --> 19:15.033
Schrader.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.526
Yes, sir. Yeah, what's up?

19:19.747 --> 19:21.206
Yeah?

19:25.044 --> 19:27.451
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

19:28.088 --> 19:31.089
Yeah, yeah, absolutely,
you can bet on that.

19:31.466 --> 19:33.091
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir...

19:33.260 --> 19:36.593
...I really appreciate you stepping
to the plate. Thank you.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.100
So you gonna keep me in suspense
or what? What's the good news?

19:43.269 --> 19:47.563
Merkert called in a couple of favors.
El Paso wants me back.

19:47.732 --> 19:50.899
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

19:51.068 --> 19:52.527
Thank you.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.272
Hello.

22:07.949 --> 22:10.784
Gentlemen. Welcome.

22:11.536 --> 22:13.113
Thank you for coming.

22:13.788 --> 22:15.661
Any difficulty at the border?

22:15.831 --> 22:19.165
The day I can't get across the border
is the day I retire.

22:20.544 --> 22:22.038
Please, come in.

22:22.212 --> 22:25.961
I apologize that it's not
wheelchair accessible.

22:37.852 --> 22:38.931
My apologies, Gustavo.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.394
Of course,
you should have been advised.

22:42.565 --> 22:45.685
It's your territory,
you had a right to bless the order.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.140
But...

22:47.320 --> 22:51.269
We had no reason to believe
the man was of concern to you.

22:51.490 --> 22:53.946
Indeed, he is.

22:54.660 --> 22:57.329
So you're in business with
this Heisenberg.

22:57.746 --> 23:00.202
I don't know him by that name, but yes.

23:00.457 --> 23:02.366
I've made no secret of the fact that...

23:02.542 --> 23:06.872
...I have always done business
with certain local manufacturers.

23:07.130 --> 23:11.756
You and I,
we still make money together.

23:12.761 --> 23:17.007
It's never affected our relationship.

23:18.474 --> 23:21.511
Don Salamanca had a
nephew named Tuco.

23:21.727 --> 23:24.135
Yes, I knew of him.

23:24.438 --> 23:28.436
Then perhaps you know Don Salamanca
mentored him in the business.

23:29.109 --> 23:31.731
Thought of Tuco as a son.

23:32.071 --> 23:37.147
When Don Salamanca was no longer
able, Tuco took over for his uncle.

23:37.367 --> 23:40.534
He was a key man in our
organization north of the border.

23:41.496 --> 23:42.871
He was loyal.

23:43.707 --> 23:45.699
This Heisenberg, Walter White...

23:45.959 --> 23:48.450
...he was one of Tuco's local suppliers.

23:48.878 --> 23:50.752
Until he betrayed Tuco.

23:51.631 --> 23:56.127
So now you see,
blood must be repaid by blood.

23:57.345 --> 23:59.053
Tuco's cousins here...

23:59.221 --> 24:00.929
...they have the right
to exact vengeance.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.714
The Salamanca family, the cartel...

24:03.893 --> 24:06.810
...everyone stands shoulder
to shoulder on this.

24:09.815 --> 24:10.846
Don Salamanca.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.025
Gentlemen.

24:13.193 --> 24:15.518
I feel your loss deeply.

24:15.987 --> 24:19.273
Please accept my condolences.

24:21.034 --> 24:25.743
I have no issue with
your right to vengeance.

24:26.497 --> 24:31.704
But I am presently engaged in
business with this man.

24:32.336 --> 24:35.088
When our business is done...

24:35.548 --> 24:40.126
...he will no longer be
of any concern to me.

24:42.471 --> 24:43.882
Until then...

24:46.725 --> 24:49.132
...I need him alive.

24:54.941 --> 24:56.898
Excuse us.

25:12.416 --> 25:14.954
I don't tell you how to
fry your chickens, Gustavo.

25:15.252 --> 25:18.668
You should really leave matters
of my organization's politics to me.

25:18.881 --> 25:22.249
Do I not run my own territory?

25:22.426 --> 25:23.836
Of course you do.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.052
And I will advise them to be patient.

25:26.221 --> 25:29.554
But I recommend you finish your
business with the man quickly.

25:29.849 --> 25:32.554
Or you risk losing the
good graces of the cartel.

25:33.061 --> 25:34.852
That would not be wise.

25:38.024 --> 25:40.431
And those boys inside...

25:40.985 --> 25:43.227
...I cannot guarantee
that they will listen.

25:44.113 --> 25:46.865
They are not like you and I.

26:11.597 --> 26:14.801
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

26:14.976 --> 26:16.007
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

26:16.185 --> 26:18.641
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

26:30.199 --> 26:33.402
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

26:33.577 --> 26:34.608
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

26:34.786 --> 26:37.491
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

26:40.083 --> 26:42.835
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you...</i>

27:24.292 --> 27:27.874
Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:28.045 --> 27:32.422
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

27:32.591 --> 27:37.882
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.
Mama's got you.

27:38.722 --> 27:43.633
I've got you. Yes. Yes.

27:45.937 --> 27:48.345
Skyler? Want some help?

27:59.367 --> 28:02.652
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

28:15.757 --> 28:17.382
God...

28:35.860 --> 28:38.433
- What do you mean? Against your will?
- Yes.

28:38.612 --> 28:42.361
Very much against my will.
He just... He showed right back up.

28:42.533 --> 28:46.661
And he doesn't want a divorce.
Won't even consider it.

28:47.162 --> 28:50.780
I called the police on him.

28:50.958 --> 28:53.330
I was so clo...

28:54.711 --> 28:57.878
- So close to what?
- Nothing. Never mind.

28:59.174 --> 29:03.467
Skyler, I can't advise you properly
if you don't give me all the facts.

29:04.137 --> 29:07.007
Understand, I'm bound
by the attorney-client privilege...

29:07.181 --> 29:09.340
...to keep everything you tell me
a secret.

29:09.517 --> 29:12.802
I can't tell a soul
unless you authorize me to.

29:13.187 --> 29:15.595
Even if it's something illegal?

29:16.190 --> 29:18.479
Especially if it's illegal.

29:18.651 --> 29:23.229
I'm your lawyer, not the police.
My job is to protect you.

29:32.747 --> 29:35.321
My husband makes meth.

29:37.252 --> 29:39.458
Methamphetamine.

29:42.340 --> 29:45.459
- Your husband's a drug dealer?
- A manufacturer, technically.

29:45.635 --> 29:50.629
They... They call them cooks.

29:51.265 --> 29:53.139
I looked it up on the Internet.

29:53.726 --> 29:57.177
This is my advice,
and you should take it:

29:57.354 --> 30:00.106
Sue your husband for divorce
immediately.

30:00.274 --> 30:03.856
Let me go to the police
and tell them what you just told me.

30:04.027 --> 30:07.478
I'll go in ex parte to get a
restraining order from the court today.

30:07.656 --> 30:11.274
If he comes anywhere near you and
your children, he'll go straight to jail.

30:11.451 --> 30:14.156
No questions asked.
This is a no-brainer.

30:14.329 --> 30:17.448
It's the best thing for you
and your family.

30:19.917 --> 30:21.577
I can't.

30:24.255 --> 30:25.286
I can't do it.

30:26.757 --> 30:32.297
I don't want my son to find out
that his father is a criminal.

30:32.971 --> 30:34.964
I just...

30:35.182 --> 30:40.686
- I can't do that to him.
- In the... end, it may not be up to you.

30:41.605 --> 30:43.727
Drug dealers have a way
of getting caught.

30:46.401 --> 30:48.892
Walt has lung cancer.

30:49.988 --> 30:51.647
His treatment bought him some time.

30:51.823 --> 30:54.989
But the doctors,
they all say that sooner or later...

30:56.410 --> 31:01.701
I can't see why
I should lay all this on my family...

31:02.082 --> 31:04.039
...when things may...

31:05.961 --> 31:10.124
...resolve themselves on their own...

31:10.757 --> 31:14.707
...without anyone... else knowing.

31:20.642 --> 31:23.180
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

31:24.771 --> 31:27.522
- What are we doing in this shithole?
- Relax, will you?

31:27.690 --> 31:30.015
Relax? This is the kind of place
you get knifed.

31:30.193 --> 31:33.644
- We should have went to Chili's, man.
- All right, already. Jesus.

31:33.821 --> 31:38.233
Outback Steakhouse. It's not too late.
They got that Blooming Onion.

31:38.659 --> 31:40.817
What's wrong with spicing things
up a little?

31:40.994 --> 31:45.039
This spice looks like it's been through
a couple of guys already.

31:45.749 --> 31:48.418
So when you headed back down
to El Paso?

31:48.794 --> 31:52.838
You know. Between all the packing,
errands, getting the ducks in a row...

31:53.006 --> 31:56.457
- ...maybe a week or two.
- Week or two?

31:56.634 --> 31:59.125
Come on, man.
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

31:59.304 --> 32:01.545
It's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

32:01.723 --> 32:03.051
What are you talking about?

32:03.224 --> 32:07.304
Ain't jack going on up here.
It's quiet as hell.

32:08.062 --> 32:09.936
I'm gonna hit the head.

32:41.677 --> 32:46.006
Those two over there.
I think they're holding.

32:47.850 --> 32:51.219
Man, in this place,
the bartender's probably holding.

32:55.899 --> 32:57.726
- All right.
- What you doing?

32:57.901 --> 32:59.609
Calling A.P.D., what do you think?

32:59.778 --> 33:02.020
Since when can't we handle
a couple dirtballs?

33:02.197 --> 33:03.607
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

33:03.948 --> 33:06.439
What if Vice is running
some kind of undercover op?

33:10.413 --> 33:13.663
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.

33:48.741 --> 33:50.532
- Where you going?
- Gotta take a leak.

33:50.701 --> 33:53.239
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

34:04.631 --> 34:06.042
Stand up.

34:13.848 --> 34:17.300
You got a problem with us, bitch?

34:17.644 --> 34:19.470
Your move.

34:47.213 --> 34:49.336
DEA. Don't move.

34:55.680 --> 34:58.681
Go out and tell my partner
to get his ass in here.

35:33.508 --> 35:36.711
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

35:36.886 --> 35:37.917
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

35:38.095 --> 35:40.467
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

35:51.983 --> 35:55.186
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

35:55.362 --> 35:57.022
<i>"Do Not Call..."</i>

36:09.292 --> 36:13.159
<i>The number you have reached,
149-4985...</i>

36:13.337 --> 36:17.121
<i>...in area code 505 is no longer...</i>

37:56.560 --> 37:58.268
Skyler.

38:00.606 --> 38:02.729
Can we talk?

38:18.081 --> 38:20.370
ASAC wants to see you.

38:22.210 --> 38:23.752
And?

38:23.920 --> 38:26.327
We were hanging back,
saw a deal go down.

38:26.506 --> 38:28.249
I went outside to call it in.

38:28.424 --> 38:30.417
You stayed to keep an eye
on the suspects.

38:30.593 --> 38:32.799
That's when they attacked you.

38:38.892 --> 38:42.059
What I didn't tell him is that
you left your gun under the seat...

38:42.229 --> 38:44.898
...before you went back inside.

39:00.705 --> 39:05.829
I've done a terrible thing.
But I did it for a good reason.

39:07.711 --> 39:09.787
I did it for us.

39:11.840 --> 39:17.676
That is college tuition
for Walter Jr...

39:17.846 --> 39:22.057
...and Holly 18 years
down the road.

39:25.186 --> 39:28.353
That is health insurance
for you and the kids.

39:29.357 --> 39:35.312
For Junior's physical therapy,
his SAT tutor.

39:36.948 --> 39:39.189
It's money for groceries...

39:40.534 --> 39:42.242
...for gas...

39:42.745 --> 39:47.407
...for birthdays
and graduation parties.

39:50.627 --> 39:54.577
Skyler, that money is for this roof
over your head...

39:54.756 --> 39:57.247
...the mortgage you aren't
gonna be able to afford...

39:57.425 --> 40:00.177
...on a part-time bookkeeper's salary
when I'm gone.

40:00.345 --> 40:04.212
- Walt, I...
- Please. Please.

40:09.520 --> 40:14.147
This money, I didn't steal it.

40:14.317 --> 40:17.234
It doesn't belong to anyone... else.

40:18.070 --> 40:19.481
I earned it.

40:21.156 --> 40:25.652
The things I've done to earn it...

40:33.293 --> 40:37.373
...the things that I've had to do...

40:38.381 --> 40:42.710
...I've got to live with them.

40:48.808 --> 40:50.385
Skyler...

40:53.479 --> 40:55.685
...all that I've done...

40:55.856 --> 41:01.312
...all the sacrifices that I have
made for this family...

41:01.486 --> 41:07.441
...all of it will be for nothing
if you don't accept what I've... earned.

41:08.702 --> 41:10.445
Please.

41:14.624 --> 41:17.459
I'll be here
when you get home from work.

41:19.587 --> 41:22.043
You can give me your answer then.

41:44.319 --> 41:45.979
Hey, Sky.

42:44.293 --> 42:48.871
- Hey, some coffee?
- Yeah.

42:49.464 --> 42:53.296
That report's looking real good.
I like how it looks.

42:53.468 --> 42:55.010
Good.

43:03.269 --> 43:05.427
Are your kids home?

43:45.768 --> 43:49.267
<i>It's here! It's here!
Everybody, come on in! Look!</i>

43:51.273 --> 43:53.313
Hey, Mrs. White.

43:55.277 --> 43:56.308
Hey, Louis.

43:56.486 --> 43:59.571
Hey, thanks for having me
over for dinner.

44:00.741 --> 44:01.939
Sure.

44:02.117 --> 44:07.656
Hey, Skyler. I'm cooking dinner.

44:08.081 --> 44:12.659
Pot roast. Could you...?

44:31.812 --> 44:34.978
So how was your day?

44:36.358 --> 44:39.394
- Good.
- Good.

44:39.569 --> 44:40.600
Excellent.

44:41.154 --> 44:46.231
I hope you don't mind, I invited Louis
to stay for dinner tonight.

44:46.409 --> 44:50.822
You know, as a thank-you for driving
Walter Jr. To school for us.

44:51.247 --> 44:53.916
We've been kind of absent...

44:54.083 --> 44:58.875
...but, I tell you,
Louis really pitched in.

45:04.968 --> 45:09.926
Look, I just wanna say that I feel good
about our talk this morning...

45:10.098 --> 45:13.549
...and I'm very eager
to hear what you're thinking about...

45:13.727 --> 45:15.636
...about what we talked about.

45:15.812 --> 45:18.564
But, you know,
whenever you're ready, of course.

45:24.904 --> 45:30.064
Honesty is good. Don't you think?

45:52.722 --> 45:54.880
I fucked Ted.

46:03.691 --> 46:05.980
Boys, dinner.

46:08.237 --> 46:09.696
- Iced tea?
- Yeah.

46:09.863 --> 46:11.239
- Okay.
- Thank you.

46:11.407 --> 46:12.817
- Louis?
- Yes, please.

46:12.991 --> 46:14.534
All right.

46:16.620 --> 46:19.455
I want you boys both
to eat your salad, okay?

46:19.623 --> 46:23.751
- Okay.
- I know nobody likes salad...

46:24.294 --> 46:25.669
...but it's good for you.

46:25.837 --> 46:27.830
- Thanks, darling.
- Thank you.
