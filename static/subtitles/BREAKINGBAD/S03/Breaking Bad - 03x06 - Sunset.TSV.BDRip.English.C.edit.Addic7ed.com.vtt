00:07.299 --> 00:08.841
KDK-12, come in.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.177
- KDK-12.
- KDK-12.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.764
Hey, Bobby, need you to look in
on Mrs. Peyketewa.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.892
- She all right?
- Her daughter called from California.

00:18.060 --> 00:21.229
She hasn't heard from her in a while,
kind of worried.

00:21.397 --> 00:23.106
Will do.

01:15.451 --> 01:18.161
Miss Peyketewa, hello.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.656
Miss Peyketewa.

01:32.782 --> 01:36.048
Miss Peyketewa.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.864
KDK-12 here.
Janet, Jesus, we got a homicide.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.991
- Come again?
- Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.

03:20.158 --> 03:23.327
- I need some backup out here.
- Okay. On their way.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.752
Whoever's in there,
show yourself right now!

03:42.472 --> 03:43.556
Hold it right there.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.057
Let me see your hands.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.267
Hands!

03:49.730 --> 03:50.813
All right, down.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.315
On your knees.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.400
You understand me?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.944
Do you speak English?

03:59.865 --> 04:02.033
I said, down. On your knees.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.784
Down!

04:06.663 --> 04:08.372
Damn it, get down.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.790
On your knees.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.250
Do it.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.755
On your knees or I'll fire!

04:59.299 --> 05:01.550
- Yeah?
- I found the papers.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.012
Right where you left them,
in the crib.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.098
Yeah, well...

05:08.475 --> 05:10.643
You know best, right?

05:11.228 --> 05:12.603
Anything else?

05:12.771 --> 05:14.397
Do you have any thought...

05:14.564 --> 05:20.194
...about how we're going
to approach this with Walter Jr?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.071
Well, he's still my son.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.281
- I mean, he will remain...
- Of course.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.660
My point being...

05:28.036 --> 05:30.121
...the divorce.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.709
Well, I...

05:35.002 --> 05:37.837
I think he gets it, don't you?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.965
I mean, I...

05:41.133 --> 05:43.551
I think he saw it coming.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.845
He sees your unhappiness and...

05:46.013 --> 05:47.847
My unhappiness?

05:48.015 --> 05:51.142
My completely out-of-the-clear...

05:51.309 --> 05:55.438
...blue-sky unhappiness?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.273
Really?

05:57.733 --> 06:00.568
Look, as you said, for the best.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.111
Yeah.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.946
Okay.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.575
Last thing and then I'll let you go.

06:08.243 --> 06:12.788
In the child support worksheet,
you list medical, dental...

06:13.457 --> 06:19.170
...child care, transportation, housing,
education, food, clothing.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.838
That's right, all of it.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.425
Walt.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.971
- No.
- Skyler, you wanted me out...

06:29.139 --> 06:31.974
...I'm out,
but I will provide for my family.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.226
Not with that money.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.480
You'd be making us accessories
after the fact.

06:37.647 --> 06:41.358
How do you think we've been paying
our bills these last six months?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.323
I have to go.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.575
Yep, I was right.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.244
Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.289
I can call over, get you in
to see any of the others.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.124
No, no, this one's fine.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.460
I'll take it.

07:01.838 --> 07:05.966
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the model, so...

07:06.134 --> 07:07.635
Yeah, I like it.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.637
I like everything about it.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.807
I'll take it as-is.

07:15.560 --> 07:19.355
Name one thing in this world
that is not negotiable.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.156
- You have to clean the fryer.
- Yes, sir.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.453
We try to clean them every night...

07:34.621 --> 07:38.499
...but make sure it's off
before you open the intake valve.

07:38.667 --> 07:42.837
Good. Now, I suggest that you add this
to your Monday maintenance schedule.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.506
Yes, sir. Now, select freezing mode...

07:45.674 --> 07:49.718
...clock button off, press and hold
auto-control until it beeps.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.720
Main valve on, main switch on.

07:51.888 --> 07:55.307
Give the compressor time
for the needle to enter the green.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.487
You're for real?

08:08.655 --> 08:11.073
- This is all you?
- All me.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.409
Heisenberg who? That's what I say.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.578
My man Jesse can cook.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.539
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.041
- Just the right shade of blue.
- Good shade.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.211
Check out that crystal size.
If that bitch was any bigger...

08:24.379 --> 08:27.381
- ...it would be a Jolly Rancher.
- Be my guest.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.553
You sure?

08:32.721 --> 08:35.931
I feel kind of dickish
with you being in rehab and all.

08:36.391 --> 08:39.560
No. I can watch, yo.

08:39.728 --> 08:43.022
- I can cook and I can watch.
- Go for it.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.357
I tried it last week.
I'm still coming down.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.735
Go easy.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.404
Okay.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.215
Riverdance.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.426
Hey, hey, stop marking up my floor,
dumb-ass. Come on.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.557
Bow before me.

09:19.184 --> 09:22.436
I am Lord of the Dance.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.939
Shit.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.607
I gotta try that again.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.692
Yeah, no, I think you're good.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.445
That is awesome, Jesse.

09:31.613 --> 09:36.825
I feel like somebody took my brain out
and boiled it in, like, boiling hot...

09:36.993 --> 09:39.119
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.455
Like anthrax.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.958
Good.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.918
So...

09:46.294 --> 09:48.254
...you ready to talk some business?

09:50.090 --> 09:53.425
You mean this is not, like,
just recreational?

09:55.136 --> 09:57.096
I know...

09:57.264 --> 09:59.181
...what you're thinking.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.643
Trust me,
it's not gonna be like it was.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.437
All right, never gonna be like it was.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.982
- How's that?
- We sell it safe.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.359
All right? We sell it smart.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.821
We don't get greedy, like before.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.490
I don't know, man.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.492
Combo and all.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.335
Still...

10:28.503 --> 10:31.005
...man's gotta make his living.

10:31.548 --> 10:36.051
If it's like Jesse says
and we're not greedy...

10:36.261 --> 10:37.845
I mean...

10:38.013 --> 10:39.888
...I guess I can see it.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.225
Had a good thing going
before we started pushing our luck.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.812
- If it can go back to being like that...
- Hey, it will be.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.398
Step one, we build inventory.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.025
Badger, go see Clovis.

10:51.192 --> 10:55.696
Get the RV in shape, tune-up,
oil change, brake lights, and whatnot.

10:55.864 --> 10:59.575
Cops always pull you over
for brake lights. Not us.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.868
Cautious.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.161
- Right on.
- You got it.

11:02.329 --> 11:06.874
You know that buzzer thing?
Leave the key in the ignition, it buzzes?

11:07.042 --> 11:10.044
Just have him put in
one of those too.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.546
Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.757
I'll get you a list.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.425
Right on.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.385
Yeah?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.888
- Yeah.
- All right.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.516
So...

11:24.684 --> 11:26.268
- ...we good?
- Yeah.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.519
Good?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.064
- All right.
- Let's do this thing.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.247
Brandon Mayhew.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.458
I know you.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.587
Small world, Albuquerque.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.609
Wanna talk about it?

12:58.153 --> 13:01.029
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.825
You know, ironically...

13:04.993 --> 13:09.204
...I think you're gonna see
much more of me from now on.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.456
Sure.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.167
Well, just as much of me at least.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.211
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.839
What, I don't get a vote in this
either?

13:19.007 --> 13:23.010
I gotta stop going with Louis
just because you're feeling guilty?

13:25.346 --> 13:27.639
I do feel guilty.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.439
I am the man that I am, son...

13:36.566 --> 13:39.943
...and there's plenty
that I would change about that, but...

13:41.029 --> 13:47.201
Here we are,
and this is just what it is.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.500
You know what? Call me crazy...

13:54.667 --> 13:59.379
...but I'm actually feeling very good
about the future.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.415
Morning.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.084
They're back.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.756
I'm wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.383
Why?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.718
They're doing nothing wrong.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.810
Okay, let's put this on Table 33,
okay?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.021
Hello there.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.191
Mr. White, I presume?

16:25.026 --> 16:26.401
Oh, yes. Hi.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.028
I...

16:28.196 --> 16:31.323
Sorry. I'll be right down.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.835
- Hi. Gale Boetticher.
- Hi.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.548
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

16:48.716 --> 16:49.716
Yes, I am.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.386
I suppose you'll wanna hear
my qualifications.

16:52.553 --> 16:55.180
I have my resumÃ© here for you.

16:57.392 --> 17:00.227
I received my bachelor's degree
from UNM.

17:00.395 --> 17:03.063
My master's
from the University of Colorado.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.692
Organic chemistry
with a specialty in...

17:06.943 --> 17:08.568
It's all right there.

17:08.736 --> 17:12.030
"X-ray crystallography."

17:12.198 --> 17:13.240
Really?

17:15.868 --> 17:18.078
I could talk about that for hours.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.579
I would love to.

17:19.747 --> 17:23.375
But first, I'm curious about this.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.381
That's a little pet project of mine.

17:29.882 --> 17:34.469
See, in my opinion,
it's all about the quinic acid level.

17:34.679 --> 17:38.598
You want just north of 4800 milligrams
per liter...

17:38.766 --> 17:42.310
...but if you over-boil to get there,
you'll leach your tannins.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.730
Bitterness, yuck.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.274
So I pull a mild vacuum.

17:47.442 --> 17:52.738
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C and...

17:57.118 --> 17:59.911
Judge for yourself.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.801
Oh, my God.

18:21.601 --> 18:26.146
My God, that is the best coffee
I've ever tasted.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.649
Sumatran beans...

18:29.817 --> 18:33.111
...and I also have to give credit
to the grind...

18:33.446 --> 18:35.989
- ...but thank you, Mr. White.
- Walt.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.241
Please, call me Walt.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.745
Why the hell are we making meth?

19:50.898 --> 19:52.858
Hey.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.568
Tell me...

19:54.735 --> 19:57.279
...with the phenylacetic acid
solution...

19:57.446 --> 20:02.075
...you said 150 drops per minute
for the first 10 minutes...

20:02.243 --> 20:05.912
...and then 90 for the remainder.
Why is that?

20:06.080 --> 20:10.959
Well, my thinking is,
by tapering the phenyl...

20:11.127 --> 20:14.754
...you get an oilier aqueous layer,
and hence...

20:14.922 --> 20:16.590
Better benzene extraction.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.426
Exactly.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.970
But actually, I prefer ether.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.930
Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.733
Gale, I'm wondering how you...

20:34.901 --> 20:36.776
Ended up here.

20:36.944 --> 20:43.283
Well, actually, I'm still wondering
how I ended up here, but, yes.

20:43.451 --> 20:48.455
I mean, I can't imagine
we strike each other as criminals.

20:48.623 --> 20:54.628
Well, there's crime
and then there's crime...

20:54.962 --> 20:56.796
...I suppose.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.798
I'm definitely a libertarian.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.843
Consenting adults want
what they want...

21:02.011 --> 21:05.513
...and if I'm not supplying it,
they will get it somewhere else.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.475
With me, they're getting exactly
what they pay for.

21:08.643 --> 21:12.437
No added toxins or adulterants.

21:13.648 --> 21:17.442
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to...

21:17.610 --> 21:21.488
...pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,
NSF research grant.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.366
I was on my way,
jumping through hoops...

21:24.533 --> 21:26.451
...kissing the proper behinds...

21:26.619 --> 21:31.998
...attending to all the non-chemistry
that one finds oneself occupied by.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.667
You know that world.

21:33.834 --> 21:37.712
That is not what I signed on for.

21:40.174 --> 21:43.843
I love the lab.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.472
Because it's all still magic.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.682
You know?

21:50.685 --> 21:52.519
Chemistry?

21:53.521 --> 21:55.188
I mean...

21:55.564 --> 21:57.524
...once you lose that...

21:57.692 --> 21:58.858
It is.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.528
It is magic.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.863
It still is.

22:05.866 --> 22:09.744
And all the while, I kept thinking
about that great old Whitman poem:

22:11.038 --> 22:13.873
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

22:14.875 --> 22:16.376
I don't know it.

22:16.752 --> 22:17.877
Anyway...

22:18.045 --> 22:20.380
Well, can you recite it?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.927
Pathetically enough, I could.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.221
All right, well...

22:28.389 --> 22:30.849
No, no, come on. Come on.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.100
Yeah?

22:37.398 --> 22:39.983
When I heard the learn'd astronomer

22:40.526 --> 22:45.864
When the proofs, the figures
Were ranged in columns before me

22:46.032 --> 22:48.742
When I was shown the charts
And the diagrams

22:48.909 --> 22:51.578
To add, divide, and measure them

22:51.746 --> 22:53.955
When I, sitting,
Heard the astronomer

22:54.123 --> 22:59.044
Where he lectured with much
applause In the lecture-room

22:59.754 --> 23:04.924
How soon, unaccountable
I became tired and sick

23:05.092 --> 23:07.385
Till rising and gliding out

23:07.553 --> 23:09.596
I wander'd off by myself

23:09.764 --> 23:13.600
In the mystical moist night-air

23:13.934 --> 23:15.518
And from time to time

23:15.936 --> 23:20.273
Look'd up in perfect silence
At the stars

23:27.073 --> 23:28.782
Yes.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.617
I am a nerd.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.331
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

23:39.293 --> 23:40.794
Come on, Pinkman.

23:41.796 --> 23:43.004
You little rat bastard.

23:43.172 --> 23:46.466
Get off your lazy ass
and go break the law.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.879
- Hey, baby.
- Are you ever coming home?

24:25.089 --> 24:26.381
Marie, I'm working.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.341
Did you find it? The RV?

24:28.509 --> 24:30.218
No. Working on it, so...

24:32.138 --> 24:35.515
Why can't you just arrest him,
make him tell you?

24:35.683 --> 24:38.560
It's not simple. There's a thing
called the Constitution.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.896
Constitution, blah, blah, blah.

24:44.692 --> 24:48.403
This kid, I swear to God,
I wish I just could...

24:48.904 --> 24:51.698
This is that Pinkman character?

24:51.866 --> 24:53.032
That's the one.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.410
Positive the little bastard's
got an RV.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.829
I just don't know where he keeps it.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.583
Until he actually leads me to it
or does something...

25:01.750 --> 25:05.587
...I'm stuck here, Marie, so sorry.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.549
Well, not to bring up
ancient history...

25:09.717 --> 25:14.637
...but I, for one, can think of someone
who might know something.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.890
Possibly.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.433
It's worth a shot.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.393
Yeah?

25:21.770 --> 25:23.396
Who?

25:27.568 --> 25:29.068
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, buddy.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.445
Hey, how you doing?

25:30.654 --> 25:32.363
Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.449
Listen, I hate to bother you.

25:34.658 --> 25:37.577
- I just had a quick question.
- Shoot.

25:37.745 --> 25:41.915
I only ask this because I'm at a,
you know, dead end here, potentially.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.417
I'm working a case and...

25:46.754 --> 25:50.882
You know that I would never put you
on the spot or make you uncomfortable.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.718
Hank, you could just cut
to the chase.

25:53.886 --> 25:58.598
Back when we lost you
and I was trying to track you down...

25:58.766 --> 26:00.808
...through your student,
Jesse Pinkman.

26:00.976 --> 26:04.896
Now, you know that I know
that once upon a time...

26:05.064 --> 26:07.315
...he may have dealt you
a little weed.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.775
- Hank...
- Just a little.

26:08.943 --> 26:11.569
And I so do not care about that.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.947
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.782
Like you said, cut to the chase.

26:15.950 --> 26:21.329
Do you remember
if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV?

26:24.458 --> 26:26.584
You know, a recreational vehicle...

26:26.752 --> 26:31.256
...you know, like a Winnebago-type
deal, brown and beige?

26:34.134 --> 26:35.134
Why?

26:35.302 --> 26:39.264
Long story, but I'm personally of the
opinion he's moved on from weed...

26:39.431 --> 26:45.311
...and graduated to selling
crystal meth, using it as a rolling lab.

26:50.484 --> 26:51.943
Walt?

27:08.836 --> 27:10.044
Yo.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.676
What, Mr. White?

27:33.068 --> 27:35.028
How's my favorite genius?

27:35.195 --> 27:36.904
Is this a secure line?

27:37.072 --> 27:39.824
Is this a secure...?
Yes, what's with the...?

27:39.992 --> 27:41.326
Hey, hello to you too.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.037
Listen, we've got a problem,
a DEA problem.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.913
- I'm listening.
- My brother-in-law...

27:46.081 --> 27:48.041
...he knows about the RV.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.250
What RV?

27:49.418 --> 27:50.668
Our RV...

27:50.836 --> 27:55.089
...the one which contains a meth lab,
which is covered with my fingerprints.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.885
What does "knows about" mean?
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

27:59.053 --> 28:01.846
No, he knows it exists
and he's trying to find it.

28:02.014 --> 28:06.059
He has linked it to Jesse. It's a matter
of time before he tracks it down.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.895
So get rid of it!
What are you doing sitting there?

28:09.063 --> 28:12.607
Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it.
Right? You don't go near it.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.693
My brother-in-law,
he is surveilling Jesse's house.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.197
So he might have tapped the phones
or bugged his house.

28:19.365 --> 28:22.700
Jesus. Plan A, then.
Go. Get to it before the feds do.

28:22.868 --> 28:26.037
And do what exactly?

28:26.205 --> 28:27.747
I mean, what...?

28:27.915 --> 28:32.126
The thing is the size of a...

28:32.336 --> 28:33.628
It's RV-size.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.422
I mean, where do I go
to make an RV disappear?

28:36.590 --> 28:38.049
I'm not David Copperfield.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.927
What do I look like,
the RV disposal people?

28:41.095 --> 28:43.429
- Did you not plan for this contingency?
- No.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.932
Well, next time, plan for it,
would you?

28:46.100 --> 28:48.810
The Starship Enterprise
had a self-destruct button.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.104
Okay. Shut up.

28:51.271 --> 28:54.273
I'm just saying,
you're good with tools and all.

28:54.441 --> 28:59.779
Why don't you invent
a water-powered car, you know?

28:59.947 --> 29:02.990
You did that,
you would be rolling in it.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.451
Socket wrench.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.453
The big one.

29:08.914 --> 29:12.583
What? You scared of the Arabs?

29:18.590 --> 29:20.842
You out of your minds?
Why is this in the open?

29:21.009 --> 29:23.177
- Who the hell are you?
- He's Heisenberg.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.680
- Is this drivable?
- Yeah. I was changing the oil.

29:25.889 --> 29:29.142
Finish it. We'll wipe it clean,
take it out to the desert.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.643
Come on, help me.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.979
Hold up. What's this about?

29:33.397 --> 29:36.482
The DEA,
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.818
You've heard of them, right?
I know you have.

29:38.986 --> 29:43.197
They know all about this RV
and they're trying to find it right now.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.825
I want this off my property now.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.369
No, no, we have got
to destroy the evidence.

29:48.537 --> 29:52.165
- We've gotta rig this thing to burn.
- Not here. Get it out of here.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.625
Now, listen to me.
I need your help, okay?

29:54.793 --> 29:58.045
If I go down, we all go down.
Do you understand?

29:59.339 --> 30:01.048
All right, just...

30:01.341 --> 30:05.052
I know a way. I know a guy that'll
wipe this off the planet, no questions.

30:05.471 --> 30:06.512
Call him.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.228
Hey, what about Jesse?

30:14.438 --> 30:15.521
What about him?

30:26.200 --> 30:29.202
Hey, it's me.
Wanna hear something weird?

30:29.536 --> 30:32.371
Now, listen to me.
You get that address.

30:32.539 --> 30:36.876
Now, Badger, I don't care how.
You find out where he's taking it.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.507
Oh, yeah.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.611
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

31:18.085 --> 31:21.295
Excuse me, gentlemen, these booths
are for paying customers only.

31:21.505 --> 31:25.758
Cynthia, it's okay. I'll handle this.

31:30.264 --> 31:32.139
What can I do for you?

31:35.227 --> 31:36.519
You know.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.649
Sunset.

32:01.253 --> 32:05.756
Ninety-six, 97, 98, 99, 100.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.967
Beyond recovery, right?

32:08.135 --> 32:11.304
- Beyond recovery means...
- I got it. Beyond recovery.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.931
- Obliterated, no evidence.
- Hey, don't worry.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.143
When we're through with it,
it's gonna be about yay big.

32:17.311 --> 32:20.980
Then we flatbed it over to Long Beach,
ship it across the Pacific.

32:21.148 --> 32:24.483
Chinese turn it into patio furniture...

32:25.277 --> 32:26.986
...so mind at ease.

32:27.154 --> 32:30.656
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm obviously gonna need a ride.

32:30.824 --> 32:33.784
- Could you call a cab?
- You got it. Pleasure doing business.

32:33.952 --> 32:37.330
Thank you. I'll be right behind you.
I just need to...

33:16.203 --> 33:17.995
- The hell you think you're doing?
- Me?

33:18.163 --> 33:21.332
This is mine just as much as yours.
You don't get to just...

33:21.500 --> 33:23.542
- Oh, God.
- What?

33:28.882 --> 33:30.841
What?

33:31.635 --> 33:33.010
He's here.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.929
Who's here?

33:39.434 --> 33:41.394
Oh, no.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.401
Oh, God.

33:48.568 --> 33:51.070
You led him right to us.

35:04.227 --> 35:04.827
Shit.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.197
Mr. Pinkman,
you wanna add resisting arrest?

35:16.364 --> 35:19.366
We'll add it. No skin off my ass.

35:19.993 --> 35:23.120
Last chance to do it the easy way.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.829
Got a warrant?

36:05.872 --> 36:09.416
Who are you, huh? Who are you
and what do you know about this RV?

36:09.876 --> 36:11.710
Well, I'm the owner of this lot...

36:11.878 --> 36:15.256
...which means you're trespassing
on private property.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.259
As far as the RV goes,
seems to me it's locked...

36:18.426 --> 36:23.305
...which means you're trying to break
and enter, so again, you got a warrant?

36:24.391 --> 36:28.102
Well, I don't need one
if I've got probable cause, counselor.

36:28.562 --> 36:32.106
Probable cause usually relates
to vehicles, is my understanding.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.733
You know, traffic stops and whatnot.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.570
See these round rubber things?

36:37.737 --> 36:39.071
Those are wheels.

36:39.239 --> 36:40.739
This is a vehicle.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.577
This is a domicile, a residence...

36:45.120 --> 36:49.707
...protected by the Fourth Amendment
from unlawful search and seizure.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.918
- Why don't you just go out...?
- Did you see this drive?

36:53.086 --> 36:54.420
How do you know it runs?

36:54.588 --> 36:57.464
Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

36:57.632 --> 37:01.594
It seems to me
you're just out here fishing.

37:03.263 --> 37:06.432
Don't see that holding up
in a court of law.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.977
Oh, yeah?

37:10.896 --> 37:12.646
Look at these.

37:15.442 --> 37:20.070
What do those look like to you?
They sure look like bullet holes to me.

37:20.488 --> 37:24.658
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this domicile.

37:24.868 --> 37:28.746
There's a judge or two out there
who'd see that as probable cause.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.414
Call the Albuquerque police...

37:30.582 --> 37:35.836
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

37:36.004 --> 37:37.087
What?

37:37.255 --> 37:41.258
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

37:41.426 --> 37:43.344
Say it. Say it.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.972
- DEA operation, there's 20 guys
rushing in here like the wrath of God.

37:47.140 --> 37:50.809
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

37:50.977 --> 37:52.269
That's right.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.147
Probable cause
needs to be readily apparent.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.944
There's somebody in there.

38:00.111 --> 38:04.490
"Private domicile
and I won't be harassed."

38:04.658 --> 38:09.328
I'll give you three seconds
to get your ass out here. One, two...

38:09.496 --> 38:13.499
This is my own private domicile
and I will not be harassed.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.626
Bitch.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.471
Fine. You want your warrant?

38:29.516 --> 38:34.228
I'll have my guys bring it and deliver it
on a little satin pillow. How's that?

38:35.063 --> 38:38.857
I waited this long.
I'll wait a little longer.

38:59.713 --> 39:00.921
Hey, Vicky.

39:01.089 --> 39:03.674
Yeah, Schrader.
Get me Merkert, will you?

39:13.268 --> 39:16.395
You know, I say...

39:16.730 --> 39:18.522
I say we just ram him.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.190
All right?

39:20.358 --> 39:23.027
I mean, we... We...

39:23.486 --> 39:27.573
We start her up
and just ram the shit out of his truck.

39:27.741 --> 39:30.367
We make our escape. Right?

39:35.540 --> 39:43.540
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.092
So, what do we do, man, huh?

39:47.260 --> 39:49.887
What do we...? What?

39:51.931 --> 39:56.018
Please tell me you got something.

40:01.274 --> 40:03.609
Yeah, I got something.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.164
It's me.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.958
We need your help.

40:42.357 --> 40:43.482
Yeah.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.360
Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?

40:46.778 --> 40:47.945
Yeah. Who's this?

40:48.113 --> 40:51.532
Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner
with the Albuquerque police.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.450
Is your wife Marie Schrader?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.494
Yes, why?

40:55.662 --> 40:58.872
I'm sorry to inform you your wife's
been in an automobile accident.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.667
She's being airlifted
to Los Ranchos Medical Center...

41:01.835 --> 41:04.211
...and should be arriving there
shortly.

41:06.005 --> 41:11.635
- How is she? What's her condition?
- I don't have the current information.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.805
But I think you might wanna get there
as soon as possible.

41:16.516 --> 41:18.809
You're gonna have to
start paying me more.

42:16.409 --> 42:18.035
- Marie?
- I'm just checking in.

42:18.203 --> 42:21.955
I'd love to have some idea of whether
I should cook dinner or not.

42:22.457 --> 42:25.417
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.169
Why?

42:30.048 --> 42:31.673
Hank?

42:32.300 --> 42:34.051
What's up?

44:58.696 --> 45:00.405
I told you before.

45:00.907 --> 45:03.742
You will not kill Walter White.

45:04.452 --> 45:08.080
Not until my business
with him has concluded.

45:08.748 --> 45:10.749
We've waited long enough.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.460
We won't wait any longer.

45:14.712 --> 45:16.755
You'll have to.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.632
The decision...

45:19.258 --> 45:20.926
...is not yours to make.

45:23.930 --> 45:28.934
Explain to me, why this man White?

45:32.230 --> 45:35.440
He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes.

45:35.900 --> 45:39.486
But he's not the one
who murdered him.

45:41.114 --> 45:42.739
Was there not another man...

45:42.949 --> 45:45.283
...who pulled the trigger?

45:46.077 --> 45:47.911
A DEA agent.

45:48.621 --> 45:51.123
Bolsa says the DEA is off-limits.

45:52.625 --> 45:55.460
North of the border is my territory.

45:55.962 --> 45:57.379
My say.

45:59.966 --> 46:01.800
As a show of respect...

46:02.677 --> 46:04.136
...I say yes.

46:13.938 --> 46:17.190
The agent's name is...

46:17.692 --> 46:19.276
...Hank Schrader.

46:22.822 --> 46:26.783
May his death satisfy you.
