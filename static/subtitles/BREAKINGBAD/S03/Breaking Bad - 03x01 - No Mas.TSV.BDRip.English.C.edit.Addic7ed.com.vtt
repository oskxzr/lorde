04:14.338 --> 04:17.715
We interrupt scheduled programming
to bring you this breaking news.

04:17.883 --> 04:20.051
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes...

04:20.218 --> 04:22.303
...KOB has received
dozens of reports...

04:22.471 --> 04:25.973
...of what appears to be a crashed
aircraft, possibly two aircraft...

04:26.141 --> 04:27.975
...on Albuquerque's east side.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.769
As of yet details are scarce...

04:29.937 --> 04:32.980
...but callers describe witnessing
an explosion overhead...

04:33.148 --> 04:35.232
...followed by falling debris.
Visible now...

04:35.400 --> 04:38.778
- crash investigators with the
National Transportation Safety Board...

04:38.946 --> 04:41.781
...are expected on site
as early as this evening.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.949
But officials warn...

04:43.116 --> 04:45.993
...that with a debris field
of this magnitude, the investigation...

04:46.161 --> 04:48.788
Officials are now saying
that the Boeing 737...

04:48.956 --> 04:52.291
...was being re-routed,
or vectored, through the airspace...

04:52.459 --> 04:55.753
...which is standard procedure
according to a spokesman for the FAA.

04:55.921 --> 04:59.256
The eight-seat King Air 350
was a charter flight...

04:59.424 --> 05:03.678
...operating out of St. George, Utah,
bound for Amarillo, Texas.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.931
It sounded like hail,
like heavy hailstones.

05:07.099 --> 05:12.019
It was just bump-bump-bump,
all over the neighborhood...

05:12.187 --> 05:16.899
- indicating that the final death toll
now stands at 167.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.861
- One hundred and sixty-seven.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.364
This mid-air collision
has left many wondering...

05:23.532 --> 05:25.491
...how such an accident
could take place...

05:25.659 --> 05:27.326
...in a system
with so many safeguards.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.996
- That the collision
which brought down Flight 515...

05:30.163 --> 05:33.624
...was caused
by improper air traffic control.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.669
We have the bombshell confirmation
out of Oklahoma City...

05:36.837 --> 05:38.045
...as the FAA confirmed...

05:38.213 --> 05:42.174
...it was indeed a lone
air traffic controller's fateful mistake...

05:42.342 --> 05:43.968
...which brought about the crash.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.847
- Is Donald Margolis,
a 19-year veteran...

05:48.015 --> 05:52.143
...of the FAA's Air Route Traffic
Control Center in Albuquerque...

05:52.310 --> 05:56.022
- Margolis recently returned to work
after a five-week absence...

05:56.189 --> 05:58.482
...which was due to, quote,
"a personal loss".

05:58.650 --> 06:02.570
While it's now known that Margolis
had recently lost a daughter to a...

06:02.738 --> 06:04.238
- drug overdose a month before.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.241
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis,
aged 26...

06:07.409 --> 06:10.411
...apparently had a long history
of substance abuse.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.912
Friends of the family say...

06:12.080 --> 06:15.082
...the death of his only child
hit Margolis particularly hard.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.086
Coming as it did
little more than a month before...

06:19.254 --> 06:22.089
...many are questioning
the timing of his return to work...

06:22.257 --> 06:24.592
...and are wondering
how much blame truly lies...

06:24.760 --> 06:27.053
...with those
who let this grieving father...

08:19.875 --> 08:22.710
I usually open with
"So sorry you're here."

08:22.878 --> 08:25.004
Where would you like to begin?

08:25.172 --> 08:28.215
I really just need this quick and easy,
you know?

08:28.383 --> 08:33.220
As quick as something like this
can be. So...

08:33.388 --> 08:38.893
Okay. Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?

08:40.103 --> 08:41.312
Does he know?

08:41.479 --> 08:45.232
Well, I mean, he certainly knows
we're separated, so...

08:45.400 --> 08:46.901
Has he moved out?

08:47.068 --> 08:49.195
We're in the process
of moving him out.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.571
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

08:50.739 --> 08:54.742
And in the meantime,
my son and my daughter...

08:54.910 --> 08:56.660
...and I are staying with my sister.

08:56.828 --> 09:00.539
- So you've moved out?
- Well, yes, just temporarily.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.000
Only so he could
get his things and...

09:03.168 --> 09:07.087
That was supposed to happen last
week, but then came the crash and...

09:07.255 --> 09:09.173
Oh, God, you weren't one of the...?

09:09.341 --> 09:12.259
Right, yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.

09:12.427 --> 09:18.766
And we had debris land in our yard,
and all over our neighborhood, so...

09:18.934 --> 09:21.769
- Terrible.
- Yeah. Apparently, even...

09:21.937 --> 09:24.939
...you know, parts of bodies.

09:25.106 --> 09:29.777
So I certainly couldn't
bring myself to...

09:29.945 --> 09:31.946
- So awful.
- I know.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.449
Anyway, I was certainly not ready
to move back. But it's time.

09:35.617 --> 09:40.537
And I'm sure we're driving
my sister and her husband up a wall.

09:40.705 --> 09:44.291
Well, you definitely wanna maintain
residency in your actual home.

09:44.459 --> 09:48.212
It just puts you in a better position
in regards to custody.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.630
Two children, you said?

09:49.798 --> 09:56.595
Yes. Holly here, and then I have a son
in high school, Walter Jr.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.934
- They need to stay with me.
- Okay.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.145
- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.065
And it's not an apartment,
it's a house that you live in?

10:08.984 --> 10:11.485
Do you own outright,
do you have a mortgage?

10:11.653 --> 10:16.615
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on it.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.660
What about other debts or assets?

10:19.828 --> 10:21.912
Do you feel
you have a good understanding...

10:22.080 --> 10:24.415
...of you and your husband's
financial situation?

10:28.336 --> 10:30.754
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.

10:30.922 --> 10:35.175
I'm really not looking
for any sort of loopholes...

10:35.343 --> 10:39.680
- ...or I don't know, just...
- No, no loopholes.

10:39.848 --> 10:44.184
I just intend that every one of my clients
get a full and honest accounting...

10:44.352 --> 10:48.522
...of what it is they owe
and what it is they own.

10:48.690 --> 10:52.693
To that end,
I say let's leave no stone unturned.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.949
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.190
Walt?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.192
Hey, buddy?

11:45.580 --> 11:46.997
Hey, Walt?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.375
- Hey.
- There you are.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.419
Listen, I... You know, well...

11:53.088 --> 11:54.922
It's...

11:55.382 --> 11:56.924
It's time.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.349
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?
Bar none.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.434
This is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.852
I speak with authority...

12:09.020 --> 12:11.730
...because we had some shitty weeks
the past few months.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.107
But this here? I mean...

12:13.316 --> 12:16.443
...call freaking Guinness Book
of World Records, call freaking...

12:16.611 --> 12:18.946
Am I talking too much?
I am, right? I am, I know.

12:19.114 --> 12:23.117
But this situation between you and...
You know, I don't know.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.786
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.080
I do not wanna get
in the middle of you two.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.082
I'm just saying, listen, okay?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.626
You beat a little tactical retreat...

12:32.794 --> 12:36.213
...you regroup, and then:

12:36.381 --> 12:41.593
You know, absence makes the...
Yeah.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.809
I'm pulling for you, man.
I'm pulling for you.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.443
- No heavy lifting. I got it.
- No, it's okay.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.486
I got it.

12:59.654 --> 13:03.574
Jesus. What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

13:06.828 --> 13:09.246
Half a million in cash.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.795
That's the spirit.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.301
I got it, I got it.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.616
Who's here for self-improvement?

13:47.327 --> 13:50.037
Come on, give me a show of hands.

13:50.663 --> 13:57.211
Who among you is here hoping they
can actively improve who they are?

14:01.508 --> 14:06.220
All right. See, that's your first mistake.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.890
You should be here
to learn self-acceptance.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.733
Hey, honey,
you want another waffle?

14:20.527 --> 14:25.697
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.

14:27.075 --> 14:31.954
Hi, you've reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn
and Holly. Please leave us a message.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.374
Hey. Hello, everybody.
Good morning.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.917
I was just checking in...

14:37.085 --> 14:40.712
...and thought I'd pass along
the current contact information.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.173
You certainly
can always reach me on my cell...

14:43.341 --> 14:47.511
...I've always got that on me,
but in terms of a mailing address...

14:47.679 --> 14:49.763
...I'm here at the Beachcomber...

14:49.931 --> 14:53.433
...and you know what,
it's actually very nice, very pleasant.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.186
Not as high-end as the Oakwood,
but not as corporate...

14:56.354 --> 15:00.857
- Oh, hey, would you please just...?
- Hey, Dad, it's me.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.193
No, I'm not okay.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.028
I don't know what's going on.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.114
Nobody's telling me jackshit
around here.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.408
- Hey, Flynn.
- Whatever.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.368
I don't even care anymore.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.954
Can you just give me
a ride to school?

15:14.122 --> 15:19.376
- I'll take you to school.
- Yeah. No, I'm ready now.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.713
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

15:23.631 --> 15:28.051
All right, I'm here. See you soon.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.082
Okay.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.967
May I have your attention, please?

16:51.135 --> 16:54.888
As all of you know, last week
our city suffered a terrible tragedy.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.890
One that none of us will ever forget.

16:57.058 --> 17:00.727
Which is why today we're going to
take a little time out of our schedule...

17:00.895 --> 17:03.563
...to gather in the gym and talk.

17:04.399 --> 17:11.238
I just find it, you know,
really, really hard to concentrate.

17:12.073 --> 17:17.077
Because of all the horrors, you know,
we perceived.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.123
It just really
gets inside your brain and...

17:21.749 --> 17:26.378
In college, they have this thing
where if your roommate kills himself...

17:26.546 --> 17:30.257
...like, if you come home and find him
hanging in the closet or whatever...

17:30.425 --> 17:34.386
...it's basically an automatic A
for you.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.098
And I just think
that that kind of compassion is...

17:38.266 --> 17:40.934
- Is something to...
- Okay. Thank you, Barry.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.728
Who wants to go next?

17:45.773 --> 17:48.358
No judgments, guys. Just feelings.

17:48.776 --> 17:54.156
You can say anything and everything
that's on your mind. Anyone?

17:57.952 --> 17:59.202
There you go, honey.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.540
I just keep asking myself...

18:03.708 --> 18:06.793
Honey, could you please stand up?

18:08.463 --> 18:09.588
Thank you.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.258
I just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

18:14.927 --> 18:16.762
I mean, if there's a God and all...

18:16.929 --> 18:20.474
...why does he allow all those
innocent people to die for no reason?

18:20.683 --> 18:23.977
Okay, can we just keep it secular,
honey?

18:24.145 --> 18:27.773
Anyhow, I haven't
really been sleeping much.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.233
Does anyone else have that?

18:32.737 --> 18:36.281
I just keep hearing that sound.

18:37.325 --> 18:40.327
That boom.

18:41.162 --> 18:45.582
It just plays over and over in my head
like it won't ever stop.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.838
Thank you, sweetheart.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.967
- Is there anyone else?
- Over here.

19:00.515 --> 19:04.768
My neighbor, he heard the crash...

19:04.977 --> 19:09.022
...and he ran outside,
and he found, like, this seat.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.316
Like an airline seat.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.193
Like what you have on an airliner?

19:13.361 --> 19:18.031
Well, anyway, the seat was standing
perfectly upright in his front yard...

19:18.241 --> 19:22.869
...right next to his Sea-Doos,
because, like, he has Sea-Doos.

19:23.037 --> 19:27.499
But there was still a pair of legs
buckled into them.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.960
Human legs.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.630
Jesus H. Christ.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.678
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry. I'm...

19:40.721 --> 19:43.014
I was just moved.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.142
Maybe we should hear
from the faculty.

19:46.310 --> 19:51.523
Certainly this tragedy
didn't only affect our students.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.651
Mr. White,
would you like to say something?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.822
And by the way, welcome back.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.667
It's so good to have you back.

20:26.934 --> 20:31.354
I guess what I would... Sorry, sorry.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.736
I guess what I would wanna say is...

20:38.863 --> 20:42.741
...to look on the bright side.

20:45.453 --> 20:48.622
First of all,
nobody on the ground was killed.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.248
And that...

20:50.416 --> 20:54.920
I mean, an incident like this,
over a populated urban center?

20:55.087 --> 21:00.884
That right there, that's just gotta be
some minor miracle. So...

21:01.052 --> 21:04.304
Plus, neither plane was full.

21:04.472 --> 21:10.977
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe
two-thirds full, I believe? Right, yes?

21:11.145 --> 21:13.563
Or maybe even three-quarters full?

21:13.731 --> 21:18.276
Well, at any rate,
what you're left with casualty-wise...

21:18.444 --> 21:22.489
...is just the 50th-worst air disaster.

21:22.657 --> 21:25.659
Actually, tied for 50th.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.662
There are, in truth...

21:29.288 --> 21:34.167
...53 crashes throughout history...

21:34.335 --> 21:38.630
...that are just as bad or worse.
Tenerife.

21:38.798 --> 21:42.801
Has anybody?
Anybody hear of Tenerife? No?

21:43.469 --> 21:48.139
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s...

21:48.307 --> 21:50.850
...crashed into each other on Tenerife.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.021
Does anybody know how big
a 747 is?

21:55.189 --> 21:59.442
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737,
and we're talking about two of them.

21:59.610 --> 22:03.947
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.

22:04.115 --> 22:09.703
But do any of you even remember it
at all? Any of you? I doubt it.

22:09.912 --> 22:16.042
You know why?
It's because people move on.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.378
They just move on.

22:18.546 --> 22:22.132
And we will too. We will move on,
and we will get past this.

22:22.299 --> 22:29.055
Because that is what
human beings do, we survive, and...

22:29.932 --> 22:34.811
We survive and we overcome. Yeah.

22:35.521 --> 22:39.190
We survive. We survive and...

22:39.358 --> 22:42.819
- Okay?
- Thank you.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.238
Good.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.649
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?

25:28.319 --> 25:30.987
Fine. I guess.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.741
You make sure you say hello to her
for me, will you?

25:34.909 --> 25:38.912
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.

25:39.914 --> 25:41.873
No, I...

26:17.076 --> 26:18.451
He's gone.

26:22.373 --> 26:24.582
Hey, Flynn. How's tricks?

26:24.750 --> 26:27.794
- How's what?
- Tricks. It's an expression.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.712
How are you?

26:29.880 --> 26:33.091
Why you gotta treat him like this?

26:33.259 --> 26:34.759
Why you gotta be like this?

26:34.927 --> 26:39.472
- Why can't you just talk even?
- Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay?

26:51.652 --> 26:54.195
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

26:58.909 --> 27:01.119
You know, try not to hold it
against him.

27:01.287 --> 27:06.958
You know, I mean, the poor kid,
he's probably just dying of curiosity.

27:07.126 --> 27:12.463
You know, and I guess
it would be natural for him to wonder.

27:12.631 --> 27:16.259
He's probably wondering, "What is it
that could have gone so wrong...

27:16.427 --> 27:19.137
- Marie. Marie.
- ...that my mother would leave...?"

27:19.305 --> 27:21.097
I can't help you get through this...

27:21.265 --> 27:24.350
...you know, if you won't tell me
what it is that Walt did?

27:24.518 --> 27:28.021
Well, you know what, I don't remember
asking you, all right?

27:28.230 --> 27:31.691
So if you wanna be supportive,
you could be supportive without prying.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.818
- That would be really great...
- "Prying."

27:33.986 --> 27:38.031
- ...and so helpful.
- Well, prying's a strong word.

27:44.621 --> 27:48.791
It's that voice inside your head.

27:50.544 --> 27:54.839
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard,
24/7 voice.

27:56.050 --> 27:57.550
You know what I'm talking about.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.553
That voice that tells you
you're not good enough.

28:00.846 --> 28:04.724
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what...

28:04.892 --> 28:07.143
...president of the United States?

28:08.479 --> 28:10.646
Well, okay,
so maybe you're not that good.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.523
But now...

28:12.691 --> 28:17.528
...are you good enough to deserve
your share of basic human happiness?

28:18.322 --> 28:22.700
Are you good enough to be okay
with who and what you are?

28:22.868 --> 28:25.078
I say yes.

28:29.291 --> 28:31.417
But it doesn't matter what I say.

28:31.919 --> 28:34.754
It's your voice, which means
you're the one that hears it.

28:34.922 --> 28:38.925
Which means you're the only one
that can fight it, right?

28:39.093 --> 28:42.929
Jesse, we never hear from you.

28:44.056 --> 28:48.935
What's going on? You can tell me
I'm full of shit. It's okay, I don't mind.

28:49.103 --> 28:52.605
Just come on. Let us in on it.

28:59.446 --> 29:03.741
So, like, what makes you the expert?

29:04.785 --> 29:06.619
I don't think I ever said I was that.

29:06.787 --> 29:09.455
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

29:09.623 --> 29:16.462
Telling us "thus" and "so," "be happy,"
"forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.049
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

29:20.926 --> 29:25.430
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever...

29:25.597 --> 29:31.477
...but did you ever really
hurt someone?

29:34.314 --> 29:36.983
I killed my daughter.

29:41.989 --> 29:47.452
It was July 18th,
which is my birthday.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.998
July 18th, 1992.

29:52.166 --> 29:55.835
I was high on cocaine
and I was drunk.

29:56.003 --> 30:00.298
Cocaine wasn't an issue. I had bought
myself two grams as a birthday present.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.966
I had plenty left.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.760
But I was out of vodka.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.846
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia...

30:07.014 --> 30:10.308
...where instead of selling liquor
in the supermarkets...

30:10.476 --> 30:12.268
...they have these ABC stores...

30:12.436 --> 30:18.399
...which close at 5 p.m.,
and right then it was like 4:42.

30:19.026 --> 30:22.487
So I'm arguing with my wife.

30:22.654 --> 30:26.491
"Come on. Go to the ABC for me,
it's my birthday.

30:26.658 --> 30:31.204
Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."

30:31.997 --> 30:34.624
And she's saying "No, no."

30:35.709 --> 30:40.671
So I'm pissed. And the clock is ticking,
so I jump in my truck.

30:41.632 --> 30:45.343
She's my 6-year-old daughter.

30:46.553 --> 30:49.680
She's playing
at the end of the driveway.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.392
So...

30:59.483 --> 31:02.151
How do you not hate yourself?

31:02.986 --> 31:06.405
I did hate myself for a long time.

31:07.491 --> 31:11.536
But it didn't stop me
from drinking and getting high.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.413
It just made it that much worse.

31:16.500 --> 31:21.087
Self-hatred, guilt,
it accomplishes nothing.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.923
It just stands in the way.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.218
Stands in the way of what?

31:27.970 --> 31:29.762
True change.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.003
Skyler.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.380
Is this a good time to talk?

32:05.549 --> 32:08.134
Yeah. Come in. Please.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.766
Skyler.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.247
Do you wanna start?

32:47.841 --> 32:49.508
Okay.

33:09.613 --> 33:13.783
Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?

33:13.950 --> 33:18.037
- Is it to punish me?
- I am not punishing you, Walt.

33:18.205 --> 33:23.501
This is punitive, is what this is.
We are happily married.

33:24.211 --> 33:29.674
I am happily married. I am happy.
We're just...

33:35.639 --> 33:41.727
I love you, Skyler.
And I would do anything for you.

33:43.730 --> 33:49.235
Would you even consider?
I mean, Jesus!

33:49.403 --> 33:52.905
You come in here and you wave
these papers in my face...

33:53.073 --> 33:58.077
...when there's a whole other,
entire side to this thing.

33:58.245 --> 34:02.248
There's your side and there's my side,
and you haven't heard my side yet.

34:02.416 --> 34:04.208
You haven't heard any of it at all.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.544
You're a drug dealer.

34:10.507 --> 34:14.760
No. What...? How? What?

34:24.229 --> 34:26.063
Yeah.

34:27.774 --> 34:31.444
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

34:35.240 --> 34:40.411
Marijuana. That Pinkman kid.

34:48.128 --> 34:49.628
No?

34:52.132 --> 34:54.800
Oh, my God, Walt.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.721
Cocaine?

35:02.726 --> 35:04.560
It's methamphetamine.

35:07.314 --> 35:11.901
But I'm a manufacturer,
I'm not a dealer...

35:13.987 --> 35:16.322
...per se.

35:16.490 --> 35:20.117
It doesn't mean... No, Skyler!

35:20.786 --> 35:22.828
- Listen to me. Skyler, listen...
- No, no!

35:22.996 --> 35:26.457
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?

35:26.625 --> 35:31.629
So please, let's... Please, let's just
sit back down and talk it through.

35:32.172 --> 35:34.590
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

35:34.758 --> 35:39.512
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell
your children or anybody else.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.597
Nobody will hear it from me.

35:41.765 --> 35:45.518
But only if you grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

35:45.727 --> 35:48.270
- No, Skyler...
- I mean it.

35:48.855 --> 35:51.982
Now let me the hell out of here
before I throw up.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.001
Bye, Jesse.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.855
Your windshield's broken.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.025
Yeah.

36:41.241 --> 36:44.743
Little friction
in the marriage right now.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.913
Strictly temporary. We're just...

36:48.081 --> 36:50.332
We're just taking a little break.

36:52.502 --> 36:55.087
That's you, over there.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.925
Listen, money.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.554
Saul has got it for you,
so as soon as you're feeling better...

37:03.722 --> 37:05.598
I'm better.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.935
You're better? Really?

37:10.312 --> 37:16.442
- What, the rehab? It helped?
- Yeah. I'm done using.

37:18.528 --> 37:20.738
That's excellent. That's...

37:21.948 --> 37:26.744
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.

37:27.913 --> 37:33.709
You know,
in spite of how bad things got...

37:33.877 --> 37:38.464
...it really could be looked at
like a wake-up call for both of us.

37:38.632 --> 37:43.636
I mean, you know, just to get our lives
back together again...

37:43.803 --> 37:47.973
...and on the straight and narrow.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.729
You been following
this airplane crash?

37:55.482 --> 37:56.982
Yeah.

37:57.776 --> 38:01.946
You know it was Jane's dad who
accidentally crashed them together...

38:02.489 --> 38:04.156
...because he was so torn up?

38:04.366 --> 38:07.576
Okay, look, let me stop you
right there, all right?

38:08.161 --> 38:10.287
You are not responsible for this.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.624
Not in any way, shape or form,
all right?

38:13.792 --> 38:18.170
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing,
probably far more than you are...

38:18.380 --> 38:22.299
...and there are many factors
at play there.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.926
Yeah?

38:24.094 --> 38:29.306
For instance, there's some sort of
collision radar on the jet...

38:29.474 --> 38:31.183
...that may not have been working.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.519
That's public record.
You can look that up.

38:33.687 --> 38:37.356
And the whole system
is run on 1960s technology.

38:37.524 --> 38:38.816
No.

38:39.609 --> 38:44.029
No, really, I blame the government.

38:45.782 --> 38:50.703
You either run from things
or you face them, Mr. White.

38:50.870 --> 38:54.790
- What exactly does that mean?
- I learned it in rehab.

38:56.418 --> 38:59.545
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

39:00.714 --> 39:02.673
I accept who I am.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.133
And who are you?

39:05.927 --> 39:07.970
I'm the bad guy.

39:25.947 --> 39:27.948
Here's some napkins for you.

39:28.658 --> 39:30.075
Enjoy.

39:33.955 --> 39:37.499
- Is the food to your satisfaction?
- Very much.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.210
It's good to see you again.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.466
- May I?
- Please.

39:51.181 --> 39:54.600
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

39:56.770 --> 40:01.482
I actually am not here to...

40:03.902 --> 40:09.782
I'm here because I owe you
the courtesy and respect...

40:09.991 --> 40:12.534
...to tell you this personally.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.413
I'm done.

40:18.291 --> 40:21.502
It has nothing to do
with you personally.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.797
I find you
extraordinarily professional...

40:24.964 --> 40:27.299
...and I appreciate
the way you do business.

40:27.801 --> 40:32.971
I'm just making a change in my life,
is what it is.

40:33.139 --> 40:38.769
And I'm...
I'm at something of a crossroads...

40:39.771 --> 40:44.650
...and it's brought me
to a realization.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.530
I am not a criminal.

40:51.908 --> 40:54.451
No offense to any people who are...

40:59.249 --> 41:01.333
...but this is not me.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.630
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.843
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.

41:11.052 --> 41:15.305
Three million dollars
for three months of your time.

41:18.143 --> 41:21.436
Three months, then out.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.319
Three million?

41:31.364 --> 41:34.700
May I take this as a "yes"?

41:43.293 --> 41:48.130
I have money. I have more money
than I know how to spend.

41:49.132 --> 41:52.885
What I don't have is my family.

41:54.387 --> 41:57.181
The answer is still no.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.230
Enjoy your meal.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.821
Thank you.

42:45.939 --> 42:47.147
That's it!

42:47.857 --> 42:49.191
Did you feel it?

42:50.526 --> 42:51.860
Texas!

42:52.654 --> 42:54.279
I've made this trip three times...

42:55.031 --> 42:57.407
...and every time
there's three big bumps...

42:57.575 --> 42:59.201
...and that's how you know!

42:59.369 --> 43:01.787
We are officially in Texas!

43:08.962 --> 43:11.129
This time I got a job waiting for me.

43:11.297 --> 43:15.425
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.

43:15.635 --> 43:17.052
Yo, that's for me, homes!

43:18.471 --> 43:22.182
They call me "Olive Oil" because
I paint them slick.

43:22.392 --> 43:28.063
I do pearlescent, color-shift,
you name it.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.817
I painted cars for some of...

43:31.985 --> 43:34.319
...the biggest gangsters in Michoacán.

43:37.198 --> 43:38.699
Wow, those are beautiful boots!

43:40.827 --> 43:43.120
Not much good for working, but...

43:43.705 --> 43:46.748
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver...

44:17.530 --> 44:20.115
What the hell's going on in there?
