00:02.169 --> 00:07.382
In the little village where I was born,
life moved at a slower pace...

00:07.549 --> 00:11.386
...yet felt all the richer for it.

00:11.553 --> 00:17.558
There, my two uncles were known far
and wide for their delicious cooking.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.727
They seasoned their zesty chicken...

00:19.895 --> 00:23.398
...using only the freshest herbs
and spices.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.859
People called them
Los Pollos Hermanos...

00:27.027 --> 00:28.653
..."The Chicken Brothers."

00:28.779 --> 00:31.572
Today, we carry on their tradition...

00:31.740 --> 00:34.784
...in a manner that would make
my uncles proud.

00:34.952 --> 00:38.746
The finest ingredients are brought
together with loving care...

00:38.914 --> 00:42.375
...then slow-cooked to perfection.

00:42.543 --> 00:47.880
Yes, the old ways are still best
at Los Pollos Hermanos.

00:48.048 --> 00:53.469
But don't take my word for it.
One taste and you'll know.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.998
Two-oh-one-point-six.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.292
Jesus, seriously.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.711
Better over than under.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.047
Over by a pound and a half.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.800
I thought you were all, like, precise.

02:56.218 --> 02:59.345
Whatever.
We'll just save it out till next week.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.389
We ship it as is.

03:01.557 --> 03:05.601
What, are we running a charity?
Come on, man. We're gonna take it out.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.312
Leave it. One batch, one ship.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.065
Stop complicating things.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.366
Why are you purposely giving him
free meth?

03:20.534 --> 03:23.870
These bitches are bleeding us
enough already.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.539
You are paid extraordinarily well.

03:26.707 --> 03:30.585
- Why can't you just appreciate that?
- Yeah. Hey, I been crunching numbers.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.087
- Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
- Yeah.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.756
And I don't gotta be a mathematician
to figure out...

03:35.924 --> 03:37.967
...that this deal you made is bullshit.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.636
- We both earn...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.973
A million and a half each.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.144
What's he getting, huh?

03:49.438 --> 03:52.356
Say he's wholesaling at
40 large a pound.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.108
That's probably high.

03:54.276 --> 03:57.778
High. What, for our stuff?
That's what I was getting.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.448
All right, look,
say he's getting 40 a pound.

04:00.616 --> 04:03.743
All right, 200 pounds a week
for three months.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.788
And, like, what happens at the end
of the three months? Look, whatever.

04:07.956 --> 04:11.959
Two hundred pounds a week
for three months. That's 2400 pounds.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.128
Twenty-four hundred
times 40,000 is...

04:14.296 --> 04:17.381
And I swear to God,
I double-checked this like 10 times.

04:17.507 --> 04:23.387
Ninety-six million dollars.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.474
All right? Ninety-six million.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.477
Ninety-six to our three.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.479
That is messed up, yo.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.648
That is so messed up.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.400
- Fairness-wise, I can't even...
- Jesse.

04:37.319 --> 04:42.156
You are now a millionaire
and you're complaining?

04:42.991 --> 04:45.326
What world do you live in?

04:45.494 --> 04:50.414
One where the dudes who are actually
doing all the work ain't getting fisted.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.500
What is going on with you lately?

04:52.668 --> 04:54.794
What's happened to you?

04:55.045 --> 04:57.505
Hang on, can't we just...?

04:58.048 --> 05:00.675
Hey, we gotta hash this out.

05:00.842 --> 05:05.054
Hey, what's more important
than money?

05:06.640 --> 05:10.518
These things they laughingly
call pillows...

05:10.686 --> 05:13.562
...I would not give them
to prison inmates.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.690
You want me to go ask for another?

05:15.857 --> 05:18.985
No, just remind me to bring his
from home.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.698
They're not moving his legs enough.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.032
Hey, everybody.

05:28.036 --> 05:33.582
Hi, Marie. Is it okay if I visit?

05:37.546 --> 05:39.005
Yeah.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.600
His color looks good.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.897
Gomey, is that you?

05:57.065 --> 05:59.025
Buddy, yeah, it's me.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.986
That's you, Gomey?

06:02.112 --> 06:05.031
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.700
Come here. Closer.

06:08.994 --> 06:12.872
- What is it?
- Closer.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.918
Asshole.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.298
Man, he got you good.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.592
Yeah, yeah.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.596
I'm glad to see you still have
your twisted sense of humor.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.932
God.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.938
Hey, check this out.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.317
I got something
that'll make you feel better.

06:41.526 --> 06:45.821
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth
of yours. Six, seven weeks, nothing.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.824
Then all of a sudden, boom,
it's popping up everywhere.

06:49.034 --> 06:54.747
Look at the new locations.
Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.540
Even right here in town.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.086
A teener here and there, you know,
strictly street-level amounts.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.837
Man, it's crazy.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.925
How exactly is that supposed
to make me feel better?

07:06.551 --> 07:08.052
Because you were right.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.346
You're the only one that
saw this coming.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.972
Well, three cheers for me.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.937
This thing doesn't do a damn thing.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.481
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.149
It's been an hour, right?

07:22.484 --> 07:25.778
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.614
I'll go find somebody.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.576
Hey, no more shop talk.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.328
Sorry.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.835
I didn't see it coming.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.088
What? Damn right, you did.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.465
No, I didn't see shit.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.010
Day late and dollar short, as usual.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.393
The only reason I'm even breathing...

07:59.187 --> 08:01.355
...is I got a warning call.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.734
A warning call? What do you mean?

08:05.902 --> 08:10.364
One minute
before they attacked me...

08:10.532 --> 08:14.702
...somebody called my cell
and told me to expect it.

08:14.870 --> 08:18.205
A voice scrambler.
Could have been anybody.

08:18.415 --> 08:23.169
Marie's got my phone somewhere,
if you want to run the incoming.

08:23.879 --> 08:27.339
Not that you're gonna learn anything
worth knowing.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.925
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

08:30.135 --> 08:33.888
- Who would have called to warn you?
- I don't know.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.682
Oh, Jesus.

08:37.058 --> 08:40.060
- Come on already.
- Okay.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.772
Skyler, I had nothing to do...

09:29.903 --> 09:32.112
Are we safe?

09:34.115 --> 09:35.616
Yes.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.003
Are you safe?

09:52.133 --> 09:54.093
Absolutely.

10:20.745 --> 10:21.345
Jesse?

10:26.751 --> 10:28.460
What about you?

10:28.962 --> 10:31.130
Face looks better.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.508
How's it all going?
Anything you wanna tell us about?

10:35.885 --> 10:39.179
What, like my interesting life?

10:40.473 --> 10:43.809
One day pretty much bleeds
into the next.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.270
Been working a lot.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.648
- Got a job.
- Job is good.

10:49.816 --> 10:53.694
It's in a Laundromat.
It's totally corporate.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.029
Corporate Laundromat.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.657
It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape.
My boss is a dick.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.368
The owner, super dick.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.205
I'm not worthy to meet him,
but everybody's scared of the dude.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.875
The place is full
of dead-eyed douche bags...

11:08.043 --> 11:12.212
...the hours suck and nobody knows
what's going on, so...

11:12.380 --> 11:15.174
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.093
Yeah.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.722
Totally Kafkaesque.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.560
Majorly.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.731
From the U.S. Attorney in Santa Fe.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.067
Very nice.

11:33.234 --> 11:36.111
You've got all these nice tulips
and baby's breath.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.740
Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.742
- Yeah.
- Look at these, Hank.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.827
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Beautiful.

11:43.953 --> 11:48.248
Wow, look at the size of this basket.
It's got so many goodies in it.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.960
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels
and cheese sticks...

11:52.128 --> 11:54.755
...and some fancy designer olives.

11:54.923 --> 11:58.550
You had me at cheese sticks. You're
gonna have to fight me for those, Hank.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.261
"Get well and best wishes
from Ted Beneke...

12:01.429 --> 12:04.056
...and all the folks
at Beneke Fabricators."

12:04.224 --> 12:07.351
Wow, he gives you all this time off
and now this.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.396
- Get me a job there.
- I know. He's great.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.774
Boss hall of fame. I don't see anything
here from Kleinman.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.360
They're gonna have to get
on the stick.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.572
- How's everybody doing today?
- Good. We're good.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.617
- How are you?
- I'm very good.

12:23.785 --> 12:27.579
Hi, Hank. Just gonna do
a quick peripheral response, all right?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.624
- See where we're at.
- Moment of truth?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.793
Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.

12:32.961 --> 12:36.171
All right, let's just take a look here.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.925
All right.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.470
All right, now I want you to tell me
if you can feel this.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.643
All right.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.812
How about this?

12:54.649 --> 12:56.483
Okay.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.611
How about now?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.614
Do that one again, would you?

13:03.783 --> 13:04.908
Right there?

13:06.536 --> 13:09.997
- Yeah, yeah, I feel a tingle.
- Okay, on a scale of one to ten...

13:10.165 --> 13:13.792
...ten being your normal level of feeling
and one being no feeling at all.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.461
Oh, I don't know.

13:16.713 --> 13:20.132
- Four?
- Okay, four. Okay.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.803
And how about there?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.931
Yeah. A six.

13:28.057 --> 13:33.729
Okay, good. And here.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.857
Yeah, still there. A little less.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.359
- A three.
- Okay.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.737
All right, good.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.198
Thank you very much, Hank.
Did good.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.993
So this is good news, right?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.536
Oh, yeah, definitely.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.079
Gosh.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.833
It looks like some nerve function
is returning.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.877
Oh, thank God.

13:57.045 --> 14:00.714
All right, so when do we get him
walking again?

14:05.678 --> 14:11.391
Marie, it's important
that we manage our expectations.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.061
We're talking about months
of very hard work.

14:14.229 --> 14:17.356
And even then,
the odds, they're not great.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.566
But you can't know for sure.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.402
- No.
- When does he start physical therapy?

14:22.570 --> 14:24.738
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.

14:24.906 --> 14:28.909
It's high-priority. We should have
pre-authorization in the next few days.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.744
Certainly by early next week.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.371
Next week?

14:32.747 --> 14:34.998
No, that's not gonna do it.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.625
I've looked into this.

14:36.793 --> 14:40.587
And the sooner physical therapy
begins, the better his chances are.

14:40.755 --> 14:44.091
He needs daily sessions.
Isn't that right?

14:44.259 --> 14:45.259
- Well...
- Actually...

14:45.426 --> 14:48.595
...your plan's treatment program
covers four sessions a week.

14:48.763 --> 14:52.766
Actually, she asked the doctor.

14:53.768 --> 14:58.272
Plan-wise, four treatments a week
is fairly typical.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.525
And the therapists in your network
are mostly fine.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.444
Mostly fine. Okay, well,
there's a ringing endorsement.

15:05.321 --> 15:12.327
Look, if Hank had more physical
therapy with better therapists...

15:12.537 --> 15:15.247
...wouldn't it be more likely
he would walk?

15:17.125 --> 15:20.294
It's very hard to say, Marie.

15:20.461 --> 15:24.798
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.259
Is it absolutely optimal?

15:27.427 --> 15:30.345
You know, screw it.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.057
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.
They can reimburse me.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.436
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
Really, I do.

15:37.604 --> 15:41.815
But my best advice is stay
in the network. Don't go out of pocket.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.984
Physical therapy is just
the beginning.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.821
We're talking nursing care,
modifications to your home...

15:47.989 --> 15:50.490
...occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.994
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.787
So what?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.290
We're just supposed to compromise
on his care?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.710
Well, if you don't follow
the insurance company's procedures...

16:01.878 --> 16:03.503
...they may never pay you back.

16:03.671 --> 16:07.841
I've seen patients and their families
go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.178
Who is the best physical therapist
that you know?

16:11.596 --> 16:13.513
I can give you some names.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.849
But they're not likely to be
on your plan.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.309
To hell with the plan.

16:36.746 --> 16:40.332
There he is. Finally.
I went ahead and started without you.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.543
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.545
Hey, kick off your shoes. Lay back.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.256
- Exfoliate.
- Maybe later.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.634
Where's the maestro,
out parking the minivan?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.219
Do I look like his shadow?

16:52.387 --> 16:55.055
Who cares where he's at?
What am I doing here?

16:55.640 --> 16:58.183
Well, I was gonna have you two
flip a coin.

16:58.351 --> 17:03.647
But since the genius can't be bothered,
today's your lucky day.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.233
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.901
What?

17:09.445 --> 17:11.238
- This?
- Yeah.

17:11.406 --> 17:14.741
You are now the owner
of this fine establishment.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.535
- For free?
- Free?

17:16.703 --> 17:21.164
Oh, ladies, cover your ears.
No, not free.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.459
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,
highly profitable...

17:24.669 --> 17:25.961
At least potentially.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.715
- Local institution looked upon with
favor by the Chamber of Commerce...

17:29.882 --> 17:34.052
...Better Business Bureau.
At $312,000, it's a steal.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.596
Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?

17:36.764 --> 17:40.434
Don't you get it? On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

17:40.601 --> 17:46.064
On the inside, it's the best money
laundry a growing boy could ask for.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.569
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.572
Ladies, thank you. Thank you.
Good job. Come back here.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.200
Sit. Come on, come on.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.953
Humor me here for a second.

18:00.121 --> 18:03.749
Now, you know you need to launder
your money, right?

18:04.250 --> 18:07.794
Do you understand the basics of it,
placement, layering, integration?

18:07.962 --> 18:10.922
I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.758
Don't you want to stay out of jail?

18:12.925 --> 18:15.343
I mean, you wanna keep your money
and your freedom.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.138
Because I got three little letters
for you: IRS.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.807
If they can get Capone,
they can get you.

18:20.975 --> 18:25.270
Hey, look. Here's you, right?
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.147
Okay, here's your cash.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.317
You're out on the town.
Yeah, you're partying hearty.

18:30.485 --> 18:34.279
You're knocking boots
with the chicky babes. Oh, who's this?

18:34.447 --> 18:37.115
It's the tax man.
And he's looking at you.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.658
Now, what does he see?

18:38.826 --> 18:41.495
He sees a young fellow
with a big fancy house...

18:41.662 --> 18:44.331
...unlimited cash supply and no job.

18:44.499 --> 18:47.793
Now, what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

18:48.336 --> 18:51.129
- I'm a drug dealer.
- Wrong.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.674
Million times worse.
You're a tax cheat.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.177
What do they do?
They take every penny...

18:57.345 --> 19:00.555
...and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.350
What was your mistake?

19:03.518 --> 19:05.977
You didn't launder your money.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.773
Now, you give me your money, okay?
That's called placement.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.818
Hand me that little thing... Bin.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.154
This is the nail salon, right?

19:16.322 --> 19:22.285
I take your dirty money and I slip it
into the salon's nice clean cash flow.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.204
That's called layering.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.039
Final step, integration.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.709
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner. That's you.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.921
Your filthy drug money
has been transformed...

19:33.089 --> 19:35.799
...into nice, clean, taxable income...

19:35.925 --> 19:40.053
...brought to you by a savvy investment
in a thriving business.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.559
So you want me to buy this place
so I can pay taxes.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.185
I'm a criminal, yo.

19:47.687 --> 19:52.899
Yeah, and if you wanna stay a criminal
and not become, say, a convict...

19:53.067 --> 19:55.694
...maybe you should grow up
and listen to your lawyer.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.947
Right, so you can get your 5 percent.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.199
No, that's 17 percent.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.578
I heard you say 5.
You said it right in front of me.

20:04.745 --> 20:08.081
Yeah, that was for your partner.
It's privileges of seniority and all.

20:08.249 --> 20:11.918
But for you, it's the usual,
17 percent and that's a bargain.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.879
Hey, what? You... Hey, listen...

20:14.630 --> 20:19.050
Come on, I'm talking to you about
your future here. Listen to reason.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.135
How is your brother-in-law?

21:04.472 --> 21:06.306
He'll live.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.769
Good. I'm glad.

21:13.147 --> 21:16.024
Walter, you seem troubled.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.151
How can I help you?

21:20.821 --> 21:26.660
I asked to see you in order
to clear the air.

21:28.162 --> 21:35.460
There are some issues that could cause
a misunderstanding between us...

21:35.628 --> 21:42.842
...and I think it's in our best interests
to just lay the cards on the table.

21:44.679 --> 21:47.430
That's the best way to do business.

21:50.017 --> 21:53.853
My brother-in-law,
moments before he was attacked...

21:54.021 --> 21:56.523
...someone called to warn him.

21:58.025 --> 22:02.195
I believe that same person
was protecting me.

22:03.322 --> 22:07.367
Those two men, the assassins...

22:07.660 --> 22:10.745
...I believe I was their prime target.

22:11.080 --> 22:16.543
But that somehow, they were steered
away from me to my brother-in-law.

22:20.381 --> 22:23.883
Because of this intervention...

22:24.510 --> 22:26.553
...I am alive.

22:26.971 --> 22:31.725
And yet I think that this person...

22:32.059 --> 22:35.270
...was playing a much deeper game.

22:37.565 --> 22:41.067
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout...

22:41.235 --> 22:44.195
...not a silent assassination.

22:44.572 --> 22:49.242
In one stroke,
he bloodied both sides...

22:49.577 --> 22:54.789
...set the American and Mexican
governments against the cartel...

22:54.999 --> 22:59.377
...and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine to the Southwest.

23:01.422 --> 23:07.761
If this man had his own source
of product on this side of the border...

23:10.097 --> 23:13.266
...he would have the market
to himself.

23:15.269 --> 23:20.523
The rewards would be enormous.

23:28.616 --> 23:29.908
We're both adults.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.287
I can't pretend I don't know
that person is you.

23:38.042 --> 23:42.087
I want there to be no confusion.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.466
I know I owe you my life.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.473
And more than that...

23:54.558 --> 23:57.185
...I respect the strategy.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.439
In your position...

24:02.441 --> 24:05.068
...I would have done the same.

24:11.492 --> 24:16.287
One issue which troubles me...

24:18.624 --> 24:23.837
...I don't know what happens
when our three-month contract ends.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.715
What would you like to happen?

24:29.093 --> 24:31.803
You know why I do this.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.682
I want security for my family.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.183
Then you have it.

24:37.643 --> 24:41.020
Three million for three months.
That was our agreement.

24:41.188 --> 24:45.358
Extended annually, 12 million a year.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.903
Call it 15.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.989
Open-ended.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.158
Would that be agreeable?

26:37.513 --> 26:41.766
Part of the reason we talk about what
gets us riled up in our daily lives...

26:41.934 --> 26:46.771
...is to help each other put a finger
on what our relapse triggers might be...

26:47.439 --> 26:50.817
...head off our disease before
it comes back.

26:51.777 --> 26:54.988
So, anyone?

26:56.740 --> 27:00.451
Free license to bitch and moan.
How often do you get that?

27:02.830 --> 27:06.165
Jesse, last time, you seemed down
about your job at the Laundromat.

27:06.333 --> 27:10.378
Let me ask something. If you had the
chance to do anything you wanted...

27:10.546 --> 27:12.171
...what would you do?

27:12.464 --> 27:15.174
Make more green, man. A lot more.

27:15.342 --> 27:18.386
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.768
I don't know.

27:26.353 --> 27:30.690
I guess I would make something.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.775
Like what?

27:35.779 --> 27:38.364
I don't know if it even matters...

27:39.783 --> 27:42.493
...but work with my hands, I guess.

27:42.661 --> 27:48.374
Building things, like carpentry
or bricklaying or something?

27:48.542 --> 27:54.047
I took this vo-tech class in high school,
woodworking.

27:54.214 --> 27:58.926
I took a lot of vo-tech classes,
because it was just a big jerk-off.

27:59.094 --> 28:03.848
But this one time, I had this teacher
by the name of...

28:05.059 --> 28:07.894
...Mr. Pike.

28:09.855 --> 28:13.066
I guess he was like a Marine
or something before he got old.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.400
He was hard of hearing.

28:14.943 --> 28:18.905
My project for his class...

28:19.073 --> 28:23.034
...was to make this wooden box.

28:23.202 --> 28:27.038
You know, like a small...

28:27.748 --> 28:31.834
Just like a...
Like a box, you know, to put stuff in.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.755
So I wanted to get the thing done
as fast as possible.

28:35.964 --> 28:39.050
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester...

28:39.218 --> 28:44.764
...and he couldn't flunk me as long as I,
you know, made the thing.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.767
So I finished it in a couple days.

28:48.060 --> 28:52.230
And it looked pretty lame,
but it worked...

28:52.398 --> 28:55.608
...you know,
for putting stuff in or whatnot.

28:56.443 --> 29:00.738
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike...

29:01.281 --> 29:03.157
...for my grade...

29:03.367 --> 29:08.121
...he looked at it and said:

29:08.622 --> 29:11.791
"Is that the best you can do?"

29:12.584 --> 29:14.919
At first I thought to myself,
"Hell yeah, bitch.

29:15.087 --> 29:20.800
Now give me a D and shut up
so I can go blaze one with my boys."

29:24.596 --> 29:28.683
I don't know.
Maybe it was the way he said it, but...

29:29.935 --> 29:32.270
It was like he wasn't exactly
saying it sucked.

29:32.438 --> 29:37.817
He was just asking me honestly,
"Is that all you got?"

29:38.694 --> 29:42.488
And for some reason,
I thought to myself:

29:42.990 --> 29:47.827
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"
so I started from scratch.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.997
I made another, then another.

29:51.165 --> 29:55.042
And by the end of the semester,
by like box number five...

29:55.502 --> 29:58.045
...I had built this thing.

29:59.548 --> 30:03.176
You should have seen it.
It was insane.

30:04.219 --> 30:09.348
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut
with inlaid zebrawood.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.184
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

30:11.351 --> 30:15.438
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

30:15.689 --> 30:21.486
Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil
so it was rich and dark.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.237
It even smelled good.

30:23.447 --> 30:27.700
You know, you put nose in it
and breathed in, it was...

30:31.330 --> 30:32.955
It was perfect.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.374
What happened to the box?

30:37.961 --> 30:42.215
I gave it to my mom.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.051
Nice.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.554
You know what I'm gonna say,
don't you?

30:48.722 --> 30:50.765
It's never too late.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.228
They have art co-ops
that offer classes...

30:55.562 --> 30:57.897
...adult extension program
at the university.

30:58.065 --> 31:01.984
You know,
I didn't give the box to my mom.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.615
I traded it for an ounce of weed.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.042
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage to a hero.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.127
They'll say they're not denying
coverage.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.754
No, no, I'm agreeing with you.

31:21.922 --> 31:24.590
But I went through all this with Walt.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.802
You'll burn through your savings,
and then what?

31:28.011 --> 31:30.054
Well, you two managed, right?

31:30.222 --> 31:31.389
You said yourself...

31:31.557 --> 31:34.934
...that Elliot and Gretchen's money
didn't cover everything.

31:36.645 --> 31:40.439
- Jesus, I gotta get back.
- What? No.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.024
No, no, no, you should rest.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.152
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath?

31:45.320 --> 31:49.031
- I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
- I wanna be there in case he wakes up.

31:49.157 --> 31:52.243
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.248
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey.

31:58.792 --> 32:01.127
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd stop by...

32:01.295 --> 32:03.796
...to see how you're holding up.
Is this a bad time?

32:03.964 --> 32:06.549
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:06.675 --> 32:10.052
Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.554
Oh, you're Ted.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.806
I've heard so much about you.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.641
Thank you for your gift basket.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.477
- That was really thoughtful.
- It was nice. Thank you.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.479
- Cheese sticks.
- Cheese sticks.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.190
You're welcome.
We care about Skyler so much...

32:23.358 --> 32:26.152
...that naturally that extends
to the whole family.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.363
Are you coming in?

32:30.782 --> 32:32.074
Oh, yeah, you should.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.328
- I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted.
- Thanks. Okay.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.997
We were having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

32:38.165 --> 32:41.000
No, no, thanks.
I'm just on my way home.

32:41.168 --> 32:42.335
I just thought I'd...

32:42.502 --> 32:47.173
You know, I am really beat.
I think I'm gonna take that bath.

32:47.341 --> 32:49.800
It was nice to meet you, Ted,
and thank you again.

32:50.886 --> 32:54.347
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
Give my best wishes to your husband.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.223
I will.

33:00.020 --> 33:02.229
Thanks for stopping by...

33:02.397 --> 33:06.859
...but it's actually not the best time
for a visit, so...

33:07.027 --> 33:10.613
Can we just talk for a minute?

33:10.739 --> 33:12.698
I know you need to be
with your family...

33:12.866 --> 33:16.035
...but I haven't heard from you
in days...

33:16.203 --> 33:18.037
- ...and I left messages...
- I'm so sorry.

33:18.205 --> 33:20.873
You gave me all that time off
and I really should've...

33:21.041 --> 33:25.211
That's not my point.
I care about you. That's all.

33:25.379 --> 33:28.005
Ted, I...
It's just this whole thing with Hank...

33:28.173 --> 33:32.426
...has been one nonstop horror show,
you know, so...

33:32.636 --> 33:37.181
Well, I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.392
Thank you.

33:40.435 --> 33:44.647
But I really do need you to...

33:44.773 --> 33:46.941
- Okay.
- Okay?

33:50.904 --> 33:53.906
Skyler, I gotta say,
your sister seeing me here...

33:54.074 --> 33:59.161
...I mean, so what? I'm divorced.
You're divorced. So what?

33:59.287 --> 34:01.956
Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted,
okay?

34:02.165 --> 34:05.084
- Is there some reason for secrecy?
- Later. Not now.

34:05.252 --> 34:08.546
- Skyler, just tell me...
- You really wanna do this now?

34:08.714 --> 34:11.173
Are you gonna make me do this
right now?

34:18.265 --> 34:19.306
Yeah, you're right.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.976
Bad idea to come here.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.688
Ted, I'm...

34:27.482 --> 34:29.608
I'll see you in a day or two.

34:30.444 --> 34:31.986
Back at the office.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.614
Take as much time as you want.

34:43.623 --> 34:46.459
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.628
Must've been, like, depressing.

34:49.796 --> 34:52.506
For real. That's a stone loss.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.467
No one misses it more than me.

34:54.634 --> 34:57.344
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.306
No quotas, no one to answer to.

35:01.016 --> 35:04.935
What's the point of being an outlaw
when you got responsibilities?

35:06.313 --> 35:10.232
Darth Vader had responsibilities.
He was responsible for the Death Star.

35:10.358 --> 35:13.319
True that. Two of them bitches.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.490
Just saying. Devil's advocate.

35:17.657 --> 35:21.869
I gotta pay taxes? What's up with that?
That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.

35:24.164 --> 35:26.373
- Church.
- Right.

35:28.001 --> 35:32.129
Let's kick it back into gear.
All right? Let's start slinging again.

35:36.510 --> 35:39.678
- Let's do it. Life's too short, I say.
- Hells yeah, bitches.

35:39.846 --> 35:44.183
We don't need no RV. All we need is
a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.

35:44.351 --> 35:47.770
No, no. No shake-and-bake.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

35:47.896 --> 35:50.189
Ain't top-shelf,
but we could at least move it.

35:50.357 --> 35:53.025
Still kind of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.277
And who says we sell on the street?

35:55.403 --> 35:57.780
Maybe I know a whole new market.

35:57.906 --> 36:01.033
Maybe all we need is the meth.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.611
What's the yield?

36:39.406 --> 36:40.865
Hey.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.951
The yield. Come on.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.454
Two-oh-one-point-eight.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.766
I see a couple new faces.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.853
Anybody wanna introduce
themselves?

37:12.105 --> 37:14.356
Don't all speak at once.

37:20.864 --> 37:21.947
Yeah.

37:24.451 --> 37:27.620
So my name's Brandon.

37:27.787 --> 37:32.124
Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us
something about yourself?

37:32.292 --> 37:35.502
Well, why I'm here...

37:35.670 --> 37:39.089
...it's just one thing.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.634
It's meth.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.471
It's bad.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.516
Thought I had it kicked a couple times,
you know.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.770
But then, Jesus...

37:53.980 --> 37:57.024
...this new version of it
hit the streets...

37:57.817 --> 38:01.195
- ...and, wow.
- Not that blue stuff.

38:01.821 --> 38:04.323
Oh, sorry. I didn't raise my hand.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.492
No, go ahead. This is what we do.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.328
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.790
- You had it too?
- Yeah, bro.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.334
I wish I never even heard of it.

38:15.502 --> 38:18.295
It was like lighting my whole head
on fire.

38:18.463 --> 38:21.131
Yeah. That stuff will burn you down.

38:21.299 --> 38:26.303
Only reason I have a hope in hell
is because it's long gone.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.180
That's the shame of it.

38:28.348 --> 38:31.183
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.352
I hear it's back in town.

38:37.691 --> 38:39.942
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.820
It's gonna be okay.

38:56.167 --> 39:00.004
I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.

39:00.171 --> 39:04.174
I'll go to 48 Hours. I'll go to Nightline.
Don't know if there's Nightline anymore.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.594
Doesn't matter. They will all take it
and they will run with it...

39:07.762 --> 39:13.851
...because he is a hero and he is not
going to be in a wheelchair at 43.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.896
Jesus.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.026
Listen, Marie.

39:22.986 --> 39:25.904
I know Skyler's
already told you this...

39:26.072 --> 39:30.200
...but if there's ever anything
that you need, anything at all...

39:30.910 --> 39:33.245
It's good to have you here.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.581
Both of you.

39:36.708 --> 39:41.211
I just wish there was something more
that we could do.

39:48.261 --> 39:49.887
Walt.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.099
We can always pay their bills.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.812
Please,
it's tens of thousands of dollars.

39:59.022 --> 40:02.900
We have the money, more than enough.
Walt earned it.

40:03.068 --> 40:06.153
- Skyler.
- I think Marie should know the truth.

40:06.321 --> 40:10.282
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

40:10.450 --> 40:13.285
- I think that...
- He earned it gambling.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.750
Walt and I...

40:20.960 --> 40:23.295
...we've had our problems lately.
You know that.

40:25.632 --> 40:31.095
And what it all came down to really...

40:31.262 --> 40:34.264
...was money.

40:34.808 --> 40:36.767
Pure and simple.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.561
When Walt was diagnosed...

40:41.314 --> 40:43.315
...it changed him.

40:44.609 --> 40:47.820
And looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood...

40:47.987 --> 40:50.489
...what it was
that he was going through.

40:50.657 --> 40:53.283
It was more than facing death.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.662
It was knowing
that he was gonna leave behind...

40:58.706 --> 41:00.499
...nothing.

41:02.001 --> 41:05.963
And so that's how this all started.
For better or worse...

41:06.631 --> 41:08.674
...he wanted to provide.

41:08.842 --> 41:16.098
And so he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

41:17.517 --> 41:21.186
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

41:21.354 --> 41:23.397
Yeah, I thought so too.

41:23.606 --> 41:26.900
The truth is he never took their money.
Not a dime.

41:27.318 --> 41:31.530
He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

41:32.657 --> 41:33.699
Isn't that right?

41:37.704 --> 41:42.124
So he put his mind to it and...

41:44.169 --> 41:48.380
Well, you know how Walt is.

41:48.548 --> 41:50.549
He's a problem-solver.

41:50.717 --> 41:55.679
And he read books and he did
a whole bunch of research...

41:55.847 --> 42:00.684
...and he came up with this system.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.728
A system?

42:03.396 --> 42:07.024
A system for counting cards
in blackjack.

42:07.192 --> 42:10.444
What do you mean, like Rain Man?

42:11.070 --> 42:15.240
Well, I don't pretend to understand,
you know, all the details...

42:15.408 --> 42:20.579
...but he was convinced that if he put
enough money into it, he'd have a...

42:20.747 --> 42:22.664
God, what is it?

42:22.790 --> 42:25.584
A statistical edge?

42:27.587 --> 42:29.963
Yes, statistical...

42:30.173 --> 42:31.924
- So...
- Yeah.

42:32.091 --> 42:36.720
So he, every spare minute, Walt was at
some card table somewhere.

42:36.888 --> 42:41.099
And at first he went to the casinos,
but then he realized that...

42:44.229 --> 42:49.191
But then he realized that the casinos
report your winnings to the IRS.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.944
And if it gets reported,
your family might find out.

42:52.111 --> 42:56.281
If you do not want your family to find
out, you find another place to gamble.

42:56.449 --> 43:00.827
Like an illegal backroom game.

43:02.205 --> 43:06.291
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take...

43:06.459 --> 43:10.754
...all that time he used to spend
away from home?

43:13.299 --> 43:15.842
I guess for a couple months there...

43:16.010 --> 43:19.263
...you were sort of
leading a double life, weren't you?

43:22.976 --> 43:24.935
Oh, my God.

43:25.979 --> 43:29.273
Oh, my God, your fugue state.

43:29.482 --> 43:32.484
- Was that some sort of cover?
- No, no.

43:32.652 --> 43:34.820
He did not fake that, Marie.

43:34.988 --> 43:37.614
The night that Walt disappeared...

43:41.327 --> 43:44.663
...he lost $14,000.

43:46.749 --> 43:50.168
It was his pension fund,
our savings...

43:50.336 --> 43:55.674
...basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

43:56.509 --> 43:59.011
He couldn't live with it.

43:59.178 --> 44:01.138
He was suicidal.

44:01.306 --> 44:06.184
But you have to understand that
as soon as he got out of the hospital...

44:06.352 --> 44:12.065
...he went right back to gambling.
I mean, that's how deep this went.

44:12.358 --> 44:17.321
How could you do that to her, Walt?

44:18.990 --> 44:21.491
Anyway, this system of his?

44:23.202 --> 44:25.829
He finally got it to work.

44:28.499 --> 44:31.376
So all this is to say
we have the money.

44:31.544 --> 44:34.546
No more gambling.

44:36.215 --> 44:38.383
But we have the money.

44:40.053 --> 44:44.681
How much money?

44:45.099 --> 44:46.725
Walt?

44:51.606 --> 44:53.231
Well...

44:58.738 --> 45:00.364
...it's into seven figures.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.743
Holy Mary, mother of God.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.454
What can I say?

45:08.623 --> 45:10.707
I did very well.

45:11.918 --> 45:13.585
Marie...

45:14.545 --> 45:18.048
...you will take our money.

45:19.092 --> 45:22.427
Use it to take care of Hank.

45:23.388 --> 45:27.099
Please. Marie, let us help.

45:28.935 --> 45:32.437
- Does Walt, Jr. Know about this?
- Absolutely not.

45:32.605 --> 45:34.648
And I need to keep it that way.

45:34.857 --> 45:37.609
And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough
on his mind right now.

45:37.777 --> 45:41.363
- Can we please keep this between us?
- Yeah. Yeah, I...

45:41.489 --> 45:44.449
Yeah, I just... I need to...

45:44.617 --> 45:47.786
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.

45:48.871 --> 45:51.498
How did you come up with that?

45:52.500 --> 45:55.419
I mean, where did you possibly...?

45:57.130 --> 45:59.464
I learned from the best.

46:05.179 --> 46:07.180
Somehow...

46:07.807 --> 46:12.602
...something tells me that Hank
is here because of you.

46:13.521 --> 46:17.441
And I'm not forgetting that.
