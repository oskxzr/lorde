00:05.839 --> 00:08.800
I am awake.

00:10.302 --> 00:14.472
You are not how I remember you
from class. I mean, like, not at all.

00:22.731 --> 00:26.484
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand,
all right? My guy wants 85.

00:28.112 --> 00:31.072
This is all the money I have
in the world.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.617
You are a drug dealer. Negotiate.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.912
Buy the RV.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.416
We start tomorrow.

00:50.634 --> 00:54.429
Work it, work it, baby.
Yo, this is sick, brother.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.180
Totally. God.

00:56.348 --> 01:01.269
Yo, Jesse, I got these two fine ladies
who wanna participate.

01:01.437 --> 01:04.689
- You got the funds?
- Oh, I got the funds. Hey.

01:04.857 --> 01:07.275
Would you ladies like to meet
my fat stack?

01:09.737 --> 01:10.778
Get in here.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.865
Come on.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.783
Hey, yo, yo.

01:15.951 --> 01:19.036
Yo, you got champagne?
None of that cheap stuff.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.039
I want the expensive shit.
Don PÃ©rignon.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.583
It's 400 a bottle.

01:23.751 --> 01:27.253
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll only have two.

01:27.755 --> 01:31.632
Oh, and I want the tall, skinny glasses.
I like those skinny glasses.

01:31.800 --> 01:36.429
That's what James Bond drinks.
Mofos, I'm all about that.

01:36.597 --> 01:40.433
Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.729
- Where did you get all the cheddar?
- Must be moving mad volume.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.898
It's funny.
You wanna know what's funny?

01:47.065 --> 01:49.776
- What's funny?
- This old dude, he gave it to me.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.152
- What?
- He gave it to me.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.904
It's his entire life savings.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.908
- What? Why?
- Because he's a dumb-ass. That's why.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.493
Oh, God.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.413
Yes!

02:02.581 --> 02:05.208
All right, living large, players.

03:08.230 --> 03:12.066
Thank you. Yo, thank you.

03:13.277 --> 03:17.071
- Thank you.
- That was...

03:22.703 --> 03:24.996
Awesome, bro.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.498
Later.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.834
Oh, man.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.378
Oh, I'm so dead.

03:32.546 --> 03:36.090
I only got... Oh, damn.

03:38.802 --> 03:42.013
I only got, like, 1400.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.683
Waffle House? Yeah.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.768
No, man.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.105
Supposed to use that dude's money
to buy an RV.

03:51.857 --> 03:56.360
- What do you want with a RV for?
- Because, like...

03:56.778 --> 03:58.613
Because, like...

03:59.573 --> 04:01.282
Never mind.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.700
Jesus.

04:02.868 --> 04:08.539
Now I gotta, like, leave town
or change my identity or something.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.250
Guy's blackmailing me.

04:11.418 --> 04:15.963
He's got, like, a criminal mind, yo.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.132
RV, yeah?

04:18.967 --> 04:22.386
I can hook you up, bro.
I can totally get you an RV.

04:22.554 --> 04:27.934
- No, I need it today. Now.
- No problem. Let's go.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.562
You're telling me
you can get me an RV?

04:31.730 --> 04:33.814
For 1400, at 6 in the morning?

05:17.025 --> 05:18.693
Right on.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.736
So do I need to sign something?

05:20.904 --> 05:24.407
No, it's, like,
a no-paperwork-type deal.

05:28.412 --> 05:31.038
Pleasure doing business with you.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.375
Come on, we gotta bounce.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.669
- What?
- For real, yo. Get it out of here.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.348
Oh, my God, I love this floor.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.853
This feels fantastic.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.564
Can you control the temperature?

06:38.732 --> 06:42.401
Yeah. There should be a switch
right next to you there.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.862
It's a thermostat.

06:49.451 --> 06:54.038
Ted, this has gotta be...

06:54.206 --> 06:58.459
...the most amazing invention ever.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.712
I know. Contractor talked me into it.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.966
Seemed kind of extravagant, but...

07:06.134 --> 07:09.804
I gotta tell you, once you try it,
you can't go back.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.809
I can never find anything
in this Buick.

07:16.770 --> 07:21.941
You know, you could leave
a few things here if you want.

07:45.090 --> 07:49.176
- Why don't you go get your dad?
- Sure.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.602
Hey, Dad.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.857
- Dad?
- Yeah.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.609
Mom's asking.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.820
Wanna come to dinner?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.698
Yeah, I'll be right there.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.956
You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.292
Yeah, right, like you don't know.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.878
- What did I just say?
- Give me the phone. Give it.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.214
Like you didn't make some deal
behind my back.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.175
Correct. I did not.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.177
I was sitting at a stoplight...

08:31.344 --> 08:34.388
...minding my own business,
when the man... The man...

08:34.556 --> 08:37.683
The kid threw a bag of money
through my window.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.852
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.812
- Let me talk to him.
- I owe you?

08:41.980 --> 08:43.898
I owe you nothing.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.317
And I will get to the bottom of this.
Trust me.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.485
Trust you? Trust you?
That's a good one.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.196
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.240
You wanna talk about trust, Jesse?
Let's talk about trust.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.077
I told you not to cook my formula,
and you went ahead and did it anyway.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.831
Because I never said I wouldn't cook it
because it ain't yours. It's ours.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.041
Plural, bitch.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.044
You did not have my permission.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.880
All I know is I got half the money
I'm due...

09:08.048 --> 09:09.548
...and you got the rest.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.342
Escalating. You're escalating.

09:11.509 --> 09:15.179
You know what? Escalate this.
My meth, my money!

09:15.347 --> 09:20.643
I will be a one-man glass factory.
I will rock that RV 24...

10:23.581 --> 10:27.751
It's buttoned up tight.
Can't see a damn thing.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.670
I ain't feeling it.

10:30.505 --> 10:34.300
No smoke, no smell, no waste.
There's no cook.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.512
Could be they're setting up.
I heard movement inside.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.849
I say we call it a night,
come back with a search warrant.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.727
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.313
There's gotta be a way.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.358
There's gotta be a way.
There's gotta be a way...

10:56.281 --> 10:58.324
Hey, hey, hey.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.068
What are you doing?

11:50.168 --> 11:53.545
- No, no, no.
- What the hell are you doing up there?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.423
Are you some kind of a pervert?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.551
Yeah,
because we were here last year.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.263
Sorry. I appreciate...

12:03.765 --> 12:05.766
Going after the bad guys.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.854
I'm sorry and enjoy the rest
of your vacation. Okay?

12:17.612 --> 12:20.239
Go back to your trailers.
Everything's okay.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.286
Guy's VFW. He's cool.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.289
We're gonna check out a couple more
and call it a morning.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.959
- Okay, what do you say?
- Can't. Gotta get home.

12:32.127 --> 12:35.337
Why, you leave your balls
in your wife's purse or what?

12:35.630 --> 12:37.339
Gotta pack.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.551
Where you headed?

12:42.470 --> 12:44.221
Texas.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.492
Hey there.

13:07.871 --> 13:08.471
Hank?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.473
Can I come in?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.602
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.938
- How did it go last night?
- Good.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.107
Catch the bad guys?

13:38.276 --> 13:39.860
Nope.

13:40.195 --> 13:44.323
- Want me to make you breakfast?
- No. I'm...

13:44.908 --> 13:47.034
I'm heading back out after this.

13:47.202 --> 13:50.454
Now? You worked all night.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.373
Get some sleep, Hank.
Those RVs aren't going anywhere.

13:53.541 --> 13:57.294
They're recreational vehicles, Marie.
That's what they do.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.296
You know what I mean.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.300
I spoke with Blanca.

14:03.468 --> 14:08.222
She said
that Steven's going to El Paso?

14:10.975 --> 14:12.518
Yeah.

14:13.478 --> 14:17.064
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

14:17.732 --> 14:21.527
- I turned it down. End of story.
- Good. Good.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.362
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.823
I needed some time here because
I'm deep into this investigation...

14:26.991 --> 14:29.409
...and couldn't do both...

14:29.577 --> 14:31.912
...so I made a judgment call.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.838
You know that you can talk to me
about things, right?

14:42.006 --> 14:44.591
You don't have
to go through this alone.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.263
Do you ask me which lead bib
to put on someone...

14:49.430 --> 14:51.098
...before you nuke them?

14:51.266 --> 14:52.724
Jesus, Marie.

14:53.851 --> 14:57.396
I made a decision.
I'm not going through anything.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.606
Doing my job.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.234
- I would like...
- I know. I know.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.027
A condo in Georgetown. I know.

15:04.195 --> 15:07.948
If you would let me finish,
I was going to say...

15:08.116 --> 15:12.286
...I'd like to be included. That's all.

15:12.453 --> 15:16.498
Don't you worry about my career.
My career is just fine.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.544
Did you not wanna go?

15:22.964 --> 15:24.631
I don't blame you. I just...

15:24.799 --> 15:28.093
- Aren't you late for work or something?
- After what happened...

15:28.261 --> 15:31.179
...it would make perfect sense
for you to not wanna go back.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.890
I'm onto some important stuff
right here, right now.

15:34.058 --> 15:37.978
Mexico doesn't have a damn thing to
do with it. Anyone who doubts that...

15:38.146 --> 15:40.397
I mean, I'm doing
some actual good out here...

15:40.565 --> 15:43.734
...and all I get
are these bullshit accusations!

15:43.901 --> 15:46.903
What, everyone thinks
I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.822
But I'm onto something. I know it.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.116
You understand me?

15:51.909 --> 15:53.660
You hear me?

16:01.502 --> 16:04.338
What exactly is this?

16:09.344 --> 16:11.762
I'll tell you what I think it is.

16:14.474 --> 16:18.185
A ploy.
A ploy to get me cooking again.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.936
And an obvious one at that.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.064
How do you mean?

16:22.649 --> 16:27.778
As if I would seriously believe
you would hire an addict.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.364
Jesse Pinkman? Recovering or not.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.700
You vouched for him previously.
I took you at your word.

16:33.868 --> 16:38.664
No. No, no, no. Let me be clear.
Let me be perfectly clear.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.834
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

16:43.294 --> 16:47.381
Trusting him with a solo venture...

16:47.548 --> 16:50.884
...well, that's quite another matter.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.471
How he could possibly
produce anything...

16:54.639 --> 16:57.641
...other than a mediocre product
at best.

16:57.809 --> 17:01.311
I am told his product
was more or less consistent...

17:01.479 --> 17:04.189
...with the quality
I had come to expect.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.733
More or less?

17:07.235 --> 17:10.404
More or less? Really?

17:12.532 --> 17:16.535
Boy, that is the...
Talk about setting the bar low.

17:18.830 --> 17:23.417
Except you don't do that,
set the bar low.

17:25.044 --> 17:30.006
Therefore,
what conclusion am I left to draw?

17:31.008 --> 17:35.512
That you believe I have some
proprietary kind of selfishness...

17:35.680 --> 17:37.848
...about my own formula.

17:39.267 --> 17:43.520
Some sort of overweening pride,
I suppose...

17:43.688 --> 17:48.442
...that you think
simply overwhelms me...

17:48.651 --> 17:51.403
...clouds my judgment.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.198
- But it doesn't.
- Absolutely not.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.201
I simply respect the chemistry.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.957
The chemistry must be respected.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.920
I apologize for being so transparent.

18:11.924 --> 18:17.429
Would you take a drive with me?
I'd like to show you something.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.516
Hi. Is everything okay?

19:02.725 --> 19:06.144
She's already finished an entire bottle,
but she still seemed hungry.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.813
Then she fell asleep.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.857
But I was thinking I'd give her another
when she wakes up.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.109
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

19:13.277 --> 19:16.738
- Fatten that baby up.
- Will do.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.286
Was that it?

19:23.913 --> 19:25.622
So where are you? Are you at work?

19:25.790 --> 19:29.334
Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.
I shouldn't be much longer.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.963
- Is that okay?
- You know I love my little pookums.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.549
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years...

19:35.758 --> 19:37.717
...as far as I'm concerned.

19:37.885 --> 19:41.638
Great. Thanks, Marie.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.269
Are you sure you're okay?

19:48.563 --> 19:52.399
Sweetie, what is it? Come on.

19:52.567 --> 19:56.736
- It's Hank.
- Hank? What about him?

19:56.904 --> 20:02.075
I don't know how to talk to him.

20:02.285 --> 20:06.037
I don't know what to say to him
anymore. I don't know how to...

20:06.205 --> 20:11.376
Ever since El Paso, ever since...
Maybe before...

20:11.544 --> 20:16.172
Yeah. God knows
he went through a lot down there.

20:16.340 --> 20:20.719
People blown up right in front of him,
blood everywhere...

20:22.096 --> 20:25.181
...and last week,
El Paso said they want him back.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.391
Yeah?

20:26.559 --> 20:30.395
He's not going. Steve Gomez
is going in his place...

20:31.439 --> 20:34.691
...and I don't know
how I feel about that.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.069
Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here,
isn't he?

20:38.237 --> 20:41.948
Of course, and I want him safe.

20:42.116 --> 20:46.411
But I can't tell what he wants.
He won't talk to me.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.539
He hardly even comes home.
He works all day, all night.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.292
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.462
It's like something's
eating him away from inside.

20:55.630 --> 20:59.591
He's just not the same. He's not.

21:01.052 --> 21:05.305
Facing death, it changes a person.
It has to, don't you think?

21:05.723 --> 21:09.434
I guess you've noticed
a change in Walt.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.676
Please.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.754
What is this?

23:03.424 --> 23:05.258
Your new lab.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.881
My God.

23:55.643 --> 24:00.730
Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.

24:03.317 --> 24:06.486
Look at the size
of this reaction vessel.

24:06.654 --> 24:10.824
Oh, it's got...
It's gotta be 1200 liters.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.161
Where...? Where...?

24:15.329 --> 24:19.499
How did you know
how to put this all together?

24:19.667 --> 24:23.461
I had excellent help, as will you.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.008
Quite a lot of planning went into this.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.553
I would say so.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.598
The laundry upstairs,
I've owned it for years.

24:35.766 --> 24:38.685
It receives large chemical deliveries
on a weekly basis...

24:38.853 --> 24:40.186
...detergents and such.

24:40.354 --> 24:43.356
There is nothing suspicious
about it...

24:43.524 --> 24:48.486
...and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

24:49.697 --> 24:52.115
The filtration system
is state-of-the-art.

24:52.283 --> 24:55.535
It will vent nothing
but clean, odorless steam...

24:55.703 --> 24:57.537
...just as the laundry does...

24:57.705 --> 25:00.582
...and through the very same stacks.

25:01.167 --> 25:07.463
I need 200 pounds per week
to make this economically viable.

25:08.883 --> 25:11.050
You would choose your own hours,
of course...

25:11.218 --> 25:13.344
...come and go as you please...

25:13.846 --> 25:15.972
...so long as the quota is met.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.411
Sorry.

25:39.163 --> 25:41.414
The answer is still no.

25:46.837 --> 25:52.091
I have made a series
of very bad decisions...

25:52.259 --> 25:54.594
...and I cannot make another one.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.721
Why did you make these decisions?

25:57.264 --> 25:59.265
For the good of my family.

25:59.892 --> 26:03.269
Then they weren't bad decisions.

26:04.730 --> 26:08.566
What does a man do, Walter?

26:11.195 --> 26:14.447
A man provides for his family.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.450
This cost me my family.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.286
When you have children,
you always have family.

26:20.454 --> 26:23.790
They will always be your priority,
your responsibility.

26:23.958 --> 26:28.670
And a man... A man provides.

26:31.048 --> 26:34.467
And he does it
even when he's not appreciated...

26:35.177 --> 26:36.219
...or respected...

26:37.471 --> 26:39.597
...or even loved.

26:39.765 --> 26:44.435
He simply bears up, and he does it...

26:45.771 --> 26:48.106
...because he's a man.

27:07.835 --> 27:11.296
Any chance
we could grab a quick bite?

27:11.755 --> 27:14.090
Thai place around the corner's
pretty good.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.844
I really gotta head home.

27:18.220 --> 27:21.014
All right, rain check, then.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.245
She said it was the tofu.

27:47.124 --> 27:50.543
Whatever. She's still cute anyways.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.051
Great dinner, Mom.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.767
Can I be excused?

28:06.060 --> 28:08.561
To do homework
or to play video games?

28:08.729 --> 28:10.355
I can multitask.

28:12.483 --> 28:13.733
Yeah.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.617
You wanna take her?

29:13.710 --> 29:15.461
Yeah.

30:16.106 --> 30:18.441
Give me something, Andy. Come on.

30:25.949 --> 30:29.535
Welded onto the back of a house.
Well, that's classy.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.038
Christ.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.958
Okay. Okay, thanks.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.805
Hey, Janice. Janice.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.352
That the last one?

30:55.646 --> 30:57.396
Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had.

30:57.564 --> 31:01.567
Twenty-nine early '80s Bounders
registered in New Mexico.

31:01.985 --> 31:05.696
- Could you check again?
- Now?

31:05.989 --> 31:09.742
- Can I do it after the party?
- Janice, I'm...

31:09.952 --> 31:11.410
I'm dead in the water here.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.580
Okay, I'll check.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.921
Hey, how are you guys doing?

31:26.718 --> 31:29.512
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean it
really good, I tell you.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.264
All good.

31:32.474 --> 31:34.559
- Gomey.
- Yeah.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.853
Time for the little bird to fly the nest,
huh?

31:38.772 --> 31:42.608
The right guy for the job, seeing as
the bean-speak comes natural and all.

31:42.776 --> 31:46.070
Wanna know how to say
"get bent" in Spanish?

31:46.530 --> 31:48.781
Just don't go native on me, all right?

31:53.412 --> 31:55.121
Hey.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.040
Here.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.295
Know your enemy and all.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.640
- Fight the good fight, brother.
- I will.

32:16.393 --> 32:18.894
Who got a drink around here?

32:27.988 --> 32:31.949
Your hunch was right. One more RV.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.327
DMV said the registration
wasn't renewed...

32:34.494 --> 32:38.581
...but then they realized it was never
filed as non-operational or destroyed.

32:38.749 --> 32:41.125
No police report, either.

34:07.087 --> 34:10.881
I just don't know what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

34:11.216 --> 34:13.759
It's like I'm paralyzed...

34:13.927 --> 34:16.345
...like if I take a step
in any direction...

34:16.513 --> 34:21.350
...I'm gonna make
a spectacular mistake.

34:22.853 --> 34:26.272
God, I could go
for a glass of wine about now.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.858
You wanna go to...?

34:29.276 --> 34:30.443
Sorry, never mind.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.281
Anyway...

34:36.283 --> 34:39.952
...breaking news is
I am sleeping with my boss...

34:40.162 --> 34:42.872
...and I don't know why.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.374
Yep.

34:49.796 --> 34:53.382
That's a lie. I do know why.

34:56.052 --> 34:58.137
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

34:58.305 --> 35:01.807
He's a really good person...

35:01.975 --> 35:05.102
...but, I mean,
it's not like we're ever gonna...

35:07.898 --> 35:10.941
Somehow,
and I can't actually believe it...

35:11.109 --> 35:16.155
...but my entire family
sees me as some sort of...

35:18.658 --> 35:20.659
My own sister, my brother-in-law.

35:20.827 --> 35:24.079
My teenage son...

35:24.289 --> 35:26.415
...tells me I'm a bitch.

35:28.001 --> 35:31.253
And you say tell him the truth.

35:32.506 --> 35:35.007
Tell him about his father...

35:36.301 --> 35:37.927
...but I can't.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.221
Ever.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.640
How could I?

35:42.808 --> 35:45.226
And this man that I'm seeing,
you know...

35:46.186 --> 35:47.645
...as wrong as I know it is...

35:47.813 --> 35:51.106
...as much as I know I'm probably
doing it to make Walt leave me...

35:51.274 --> 35:57.988
...it is the only thing in my day
where I don't feel...

36:00.242 --> 36:02.618
...like I'm...

36:04.287 --> 36:06.038
...drowning.

36:08.875 --> 36:12.837
So he knows about this other man?

36:13.338 --> 36:14.463
Yeah.

36:14.631 --> 36:17.800
So then he'll sign?

36:19.386 --> 36:23.138
Walt says he's not going anywhere...

36:23.306 --> 36:27.768
...so that's a really brilliant
gambit on my part. Yep.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.145
Genius.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.490
He keeps money in the house.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.245
Your husband, the drug dealer?

36:46.413 --> 36:48.539
How much money?

36:49.332 --> 36:53.043
I didn't count it. It's heavy.

36:54.588 --> 36:58.173
A bag, where he keeps it.

36:59.426 --> 37:03.387
Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

37:03.555 --> 37:05.681
No. God, no. I just...

37:05.849 --> 37:08.183
No, I'm just, you know...

37:08.351 --> 37:11.770
I'm just trying to just talk it through.
That's...

37:11.938 --> 37:14.106
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified...

37:14.316 --> 37:18.110
...and twice the price of a therapist.
There is nothing to discuss here.

37:18.278 --> 37:22.281
I'm just saying, you know?
We have a history.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.367
He's the father of my children...

37:25.785 --> 37:28.287
...and maybe what he did, he...

37:28.455 --> 37:30.623
He did it for the family. Right?

37:31.541 --> 37:32.791
Well, guess what.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.628
That is one enormous load
of horse shit.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.129
Okay.

37:37.297 --> 37:40.132
I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

37:40.634 --> 37:45.471
You are a fool to stay in that house
one minute longer.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.973
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

37:48.141 --> 37:50.392
You are now an accessory
after the fact.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.810
You are culpable.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.980
You, your children,
you could lose everything you own.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.107
Do you understand?

37:57.484 --> 38:02.279
All courtesy of this criminal
you refuse to divorce.

38:02.989 --> 38:07.326
- I didn't marry a criminal.
- Well, you're married to one now.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.199
How about we run through this
one more time...

39:29.367 --> 39:32.161
...especially where I do the talking,
you don't say jack?

39:32.328 --> 39:35.247
Oh, I'm gonna say jack.
I'm gonna say plenty.

39:35.457 --> 39:38.709
What did we say about escalating,
huh? Who's got your back here?

39:38.877 --> 39:41.420
Me, all right?
I'm going to take care of things.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.923
Hey, what are the parameters
of this sobriety thing you got going?

39:45.091 --> 39:47.092
- What do you mean?
- Can you take a Xanax?

39:47.260 --> 39:49.428
Because I got a drawer full of them.

39:49.596 --> 39:52.765
I get them from my "chiropractor."

39:52.974 --> 39:57.853
Vietnamese, 5-foot tall.
She adjusts you to "completion."

39:58.897 --> 40:00.731
Her name's Kim Nu Suong...

40:01.941 --> 40:04.902
...as delicious as it sounds.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.446
I should give you her card.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.032
Hell with this. I'm out of here.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.950
He's here.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.412
Send him in.

40:19.584 --> 40:22.711
Hello, Walt. Good to see you.

40:22.879 --> 40:26.757
Please, have a seat here.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.468
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

40:31.304 --> 40:32.888
You're late.

40:33.056 --> 40:36.100
Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here now.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.769
There's always a way
to oil everyone's lock.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.815
This young man is prepared
to offer you a sweetheart of a deal...

40:43.024 --> 40:46.318
- ...for doing precisely nothing.
- Really?

40:46.528 --> 40:51.281
Ten percent of all future profits
from his solo venture.

40:51.449 --> 40:55.494
That's money you get paid
for walking down to the mailbox.

40:55.662 --> 40:59.331
Consider it a gesture of respect
for your valuable contribution...

40:59.499 --> 41:03.335
...to the business thus far.
I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.

41:03.503 --> 41:06.588
That's charity, is what that is.

41:06.756 --> 41:08.298
I do all the work.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.301
He sits around on his fat ass
judging people.

41:12.095 --> 41:15.139
Escalating. Stop.

41:15.557 --> 41:18.934
So there's that,
but then there's one small detail.

41:19.102 --> 41:22.354
Clearly a mistake was made
on the part of our mutual associate...

41:22.564 --> 41:25.149
...when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

41:25.316 --> 41:28.902
He must not have realized that you
two had come to a parting of the ways.

41:29.070 --> 41:31.822
Take it. It belongs to you.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.158
You're damn right it belongs to me.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.703
I knew I could count on you boys
to play nice. That's...

41:37.871 --> 41:40.289
- That almost brings a tear to my eye.
- Enjoy it.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.791
Spend it in good health.

41:43.084 --> 41:47.588
That is the last money
you'll ever earn in this business.

41:48.089 --> 41:50.382
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

41:52.218 --> 41:57.514
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse,
but our mutual associate...

41:57.682 --> 42:01.727
...was only using you to get to me.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.228
What are you talking about?

42:03.396 --> 42:07.858
See, he needs someone
with expertise...

42:08.401 --> 42:10.736
...someone who knows
what he's doing.

42:10.904 --> 42:14.531
In other words, he needs me.

42:15.158 --> 42:17.242
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

42:17.911 --> 42:20.996
Yeah.
Let's see, how should I put this?

42:23.041 --> 42:24.249
I'm in.

42:25.919 --> 42:27.169
You're out.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.925
Walt, hold on there.

42:33.134 --> 42:36.929
What was the offer, if I may ask?

42:37.430 --> 42:42.351
It's 3 million
for three months of my time.

42:42.518 --> 42:45.562
You're gonna need that money
laundered. I mean, of course.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.064
What was our deal before?

42:47.232 --> 42:49.358
Seventeen percent.
That's a shade high.

42:49.525 --> 42:52.861
Let's settle on an even 15.
That's a nice round number.

42:53.029 --> 42:54.071
Five percent.

42:54.239 --> 42:55.864
- Fourteen's fair.
- Five.

42:56.032 --> 42:57.074
- Thirteen.
- Five.

42:57.242 --> 43:00.285
- Twelve. For old times' sake, 12.
- Five.

43:00.453 --> 43:03.038
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

43:03.206 --> 43:06.625
Ten even, but I can't go any lower
and still respect myself.

43:06.793 --> 43:07.876
Five.

43:08.044 --> 43:11.964
What in the hell just happened?
You're my lawyer, not his.

43:12.131 --> 43:15.592
That's the way of the world, kid.
Go with the winner.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.053
You think this will stop me
from cooking?

43:18.221 --> 43:19.763
Cook whatever you like.

43:19.931 --> 43:23.892
As long as it's that ridiculous
Chili P or some other dreck...

43:24.060 --> 43:27.271
...but don't even think
about using my formula.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.607
Just try and stop me, bitch.

44:21.242 --> 44:23.702
- Yes?
- Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?

44:23.870 --> 44:25.871
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

44:26.039 --> 44:28.790
I'm with the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

44:28.958 --> 44:32.461
We're interested in an RV that's
registered to your name and address.

44:33.504 --> 44:36.381
- Do you have an RV?
- I did.

44:36.549 --> 44:38.383
It was stolen months ago.

44:39.302 --> 44:41.386
Stolen, huh? Yeah.

44:42.180 --> 44:45.390
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

44:45.558 --> 44:48.518
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police or the DMV.

44:48.686 --> 44:51.480
I just didn't get around to it.

44:51.981 --> 44:53.565
May I ask why?

44:54.734 --> 44:57.569
I mean, it's a great way
to get the family together...

44:57.737 --> 44:59.237
...for an affordable vacation.

44:59.405 --> 45:01.531
It must've been a blow
when it went missing.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.325
It was.

45:04.869 --> 45:07.704
Do you have any ideas at all
who might've taken it?

45:10.166 --> 45:12.542
I didn't want him arrested.

45:12.794 --> 45:17.172
He ran with a bad crowd,
but he was never a bad person.

45:17.882 --> 45:19.800
I thought he could turn
his life around.

45:19.967 --> 45:21.760
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

45:22.220 --> 45:24.012
My son.

45:24.847 --> 45:27.224
I'd really like to speak with him.

45:28.101 --> 45:32.270
He's passed away.
He was shot two months ago.

45:34.190 --> 45:36.274
- What was your son's name?
- Christian.

45:36.442 --> 45:38.902
Christian Ortega.

45:40.446 --> 45:43.115
Was his nickname Combo?

45:52.125 --> 45:54.584
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.
