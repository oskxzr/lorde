<i>So cigarettes and gas is...</i>

00:45.075 --> 00:46.858
$79.70

00:49.720 --> 00:50.765
Crap.

00:51.772 --> 00:53.643
Oh, there's an ATM right outside.

00:53.799 --> 00:54.799
Yeah,

00:55.238 --> 00:57.089
I don't have a card.

00:57.821 --> 01:00.651
Well, you can write
a personal check with ID.

01:01.912 --> 01:04.943
Kind of in between banks
right now.

01:06.098 --> 01:07.593
You think I

01:07.841 --> 01:09.205
could just come back later?

01:09.235 --> 01:12.170
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back.

01:15.236 --> 01:18.420
If it were me, I'd be, "Totally,
you know, no problem."

01:18.734 --> 01:21.616
But my dad is this
ginormous hardass.

01:21.862 --> 01:23.777
He was in Fallujah for a year,

01:23.952 --> 01:26.162
and he always checks
the receipts.

01:26.192 --> 01:27.499
I mean, like... always.

01:28.450 --> 01:30.002
I've got to call him.
I'm sorry.

01:30.032 --> 01:31.291
Wait, wait, wait.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.631
Hold

01:33.063 --> 01:34.458
Hold on a second.

01:36.079 --> 01:37.674
Maybe if we could, um...

01:39.483 --> 01:40.846
trade.

01:47.278 --> 01:48.873
Ever try it?

01:50.846 --> 01:53.674
I mean, I smoke pot
a lot sometimes.

01:54.406 --> 01:55.624
I party.

01:55.926 --> 01:56.971
But...

01:57.590 --> 01:59.603
...But that stuff's
really addictive, right?

01:59.633 --> 02:02.757
Not really. It's just
a media thing. You know?

02:02.787 --> 02:03.906
You know?

02:07.855 --> 02:09.193
What's it like?

02:14.831 --> 02:16.182
It's awesome.

02:18.822 --> 02:19.967
Everything's

02:21.079 --> 02:23.344
maximum interesting.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.084
You get these really cold

02:26.735 --> 02:31.020
and sharp-like
action dagger feelings.

02:34.792 --> 02:35.968
It's awesome.

02:38.146 --> 02:39.159
Come on.

02:39.610 --> 02:40.798
What do you say?

03:14.104 --> 03:15.442
Have a nice day.

03:55.577 --> 03:57.197
<i>Now, how does it feel?</i>

03:57.779 --> 03:58.899
<i>Does it hurt?</i>

03:59.293 --> 04:00.632
Yeah, it's tight.

04:01.646 --> 04:03.148
Okay, but is it painful?

04:03.961 --> 04:05.744
It's hard to breathe.

04:05.947 --> 04:07.924
Well, you need your breathing.

04:09.225 --> 04:11.291
Uh, well...

04:11.321 --> 04:15.243
...although let's not lose sight of the fact that you
were the victim of a terrible accident, Antonio...

04:15.244 --> 04:17.865
...so some discomfort
is to be expected.

04:24.959 --> 04:26.436
Let's go with that one.

04:33.879 --> 04:38.166
Oh, and spread the word. I'm
building a class-action, flight 515.

04:38.196 --> 04:39.846
Victims' families would be great,

04:39.847 --> 04:42.697
but I'll take anyone on he ground

04:42.727 --> 04:45.448
who suffered emotionally anxiety, sleeplessness,
you get the picture.

04:46.093 --> 04:47.125
Trouble?

04:48.633 --> 04:51.210
<i>Ted Beneke?
You cannot be serious.</i>

04:51.240 --> 04:54.375
<i>That guys is a joke. You know what, Walt?
You know what? You called my bluff.</i>

04:54.405 --> 04:56.063
<i>I called your...
What does that even mean?</i>

04:56.093 --> 04:59.642
<i>You dared me to tell the police,
and I couldn't do it, so you win.</i>

04:59.672 --> 05:02.857
<i>If you want to stay in this house,
fine, but we are not married anymore.</i>

05:02.865 --> 05:06.038
<i>I told you that I was done
cooking meth, Skyler.</i>

05:06.068 --> 05:08.397
<i>Oh, right.
I promised you that. And so what?</i>

05:08.427 --> 05:11.049
<i>At least I didn't
run off to go...</i>

05:11.079 --> 05:14.483
<i>Jesus! I mean,
everything that I did, I did for this family.</i>

05:14.513 --> 05:17.873
<i>Oh, yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.
Oh, and what is that supposed to mean?</i>

05:17.885 --> 05:19.782
<i>You don't like it?
Then leave</i>

05:19.812 --> 05:23.589
<i>and take your
drug money with you. That's what you want.</i>

05:24.675 --> 05:25.707
Jesus.

05:26.341 --> 05:27.868
Garbage disposal.

05:28.444 --> 05:30.446
<i>You think this will
get me to move out?</i>

05:30.476 --> 05:35.035
<i>You can screw Ted. You can screw the butcher,
the mailman, whoever you want.</i>

05:35.065 --> 05:37.423
<i>Screw them all.
I'm not going anywhere.</i>

05:37.455 --> 05:39.269
<i>Good. Suit yourself.</i>

05:40.270 --> 05:42.548
Is this a good or bad thing?

05:43.675 --> 05:46.436
<i>You want me to suit myself?</i>

05:46.466 --> 05:48.924
<i>I'll suit myself to his face!</i>

05:48.993 --> 05:50.368
It's a bad thing.

06:01.499 --> 06:02.525
Hello.

06:04.277 --> 06:06.054
Ahem. Walter White
to see Ted Beneke.

06:06.084 --> 06:09.616
I'm sorry. Mr. Beneke's
on a conference call.

06:10.634 --> 06:11.647
Mm-hmm, okay.

06:11.885 --> 06:13.662
I will wait.

06:14.313 --> 06:16.052
It could be a while.

06:16.390 --> 06:18.330
I have all the time in the world.

06:44.352 --> 06:45.653
Okay.

06:47.518 --> 06:48.819
Here we go. Okay.

06:48.849 --> 06:51.767
Excuse me. Mr. Beneke's
not available. Ted?

06:51.797 --> 06:53.482
- Come on.
- Señor...

06:56.765 --> 07:01.032
Ted, I can see you. I can see you standing
right there in your office.

07:01.062 --> 07:02.298
Now, come on.

07:03.136 --> 07:06.990
Open the door. Come on, let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

07:07.478 --> 07:09.342
Come on, let's be men
about this. Huh? Okay?

07:09.492 --> 07:10.606
How about that? Aha.

07:12.523 --> 07:15.263
Hey, Walt, I'm kind of
in the middle of something

07:15.293 --> 07:17.011
Oh, yes, you are.

07:17.203 --> 07:18.754
So open the door.

07:18.892 --> 07:21.352
You're damn right you are.
You're right in the middle.

07:21.382 --> 07:23.572
Just open the door,
and let's talk about it, okay?

07:24.013 --> 07:26.599
Open the door, Ted, right now.

07:27.343 --> 07:31.654
All right, you don't want to be a man about it?
Okay. Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B.

07:38.252 --> 07:40.473
¡Walt! ¡Walt!

07:40.737 --> 07:41.836
¡Walt!

07:42.180 --> 07:44.071
What are you doing?

07:44.804 --> 07:46.483
I'm talking with Ted.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.140
¡Next time,

07:59.175 --> 08:00.607
...you'll open...

08:01.038 --> 08:02.665
...the door!

08:02.963 --> 08:04.645
Señor, vamos.

08:04.966 --> 08:07.600
I'm just here to talk.

08:07.635 --> 08:09.775
I just want to talk to him.

08:11.022 --> 08:13.289
God. Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

08:14.349 --> 08:17.707
I'm just talk... All right. All right,
all right, all right, I'm calm.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.018
¡I'm calm!

08:20.203 --> 08:21.607
Fuck.

08:40.593 --> 08:42.665
What do you want?
What do you want?

08:42.852 --> 08:45.174
Hey! Hey, come on.

08:47.976 --> 08:49.686
What the hell is wrong with you?

08:49.853 --> 08:52.463
You act like you're the first
guy this ever happened to.

08:52.498 --> 08:56.232
I caught my second wife
screwing my stepdad, okay?

08:56.385 --> 08:59.232
It's a cruel world, Walt.
Grow up.

09:00.368 --> 09:03.702
I just wanted to talk to him. Yeah,
well, now I'm talking to you.

09:03.737 --> 09:06.062
Consider this an intervention.

09:06.097 --> 09:08.857
You could have been arrested back there.
You understand.

09:09.021 --> 09:12.215
I mean, speaking as your lawyer, I'm
always looking for billable hours,

09:12.250 --> 09:14.454
but speaking
as your business associate,

09:14.489 --> 09:18.042
I'm strongly advising that
you get your shit together.

09:18.730 --> 09:22.659
Just cool it with this Beneke
guy, at least for now. Okay?

09:23.974 --> 09:25.295
Let's talk shop

09:25.826 --> 09:27.930
because I think this is
a great opportunity

09:27.965 --> 09:31.534
to channel some of that negative
energy into something positive.

09:31.944 --> 09:33.300
How did you know?

09:33.785 --> 09:34.785
Sorry?

09:35.198 --> 09:39.258
About Skyler, About where to find me
just now. How did you know?

09:40.043 --> 09:41.965
That's just my meticulousness.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.133
Don't bog down in detail,
Walt. The lesson here...

09:45.168 --> 09:47.863
Did you bug my house?

09:51.452 --> 09:54.831
Yeah, but I didn't know it was your house, did I?
You had moved out.

09:54.866 --> 09:56.872
Besides,
you basically told me to.

09:56.907 --> 09:59.934
I told you to? You strongly
hinted that I should.

09:59.969 --> 10:01.881
You were worried
about your wife, remember?

10:01.916 --> 10:04.262
You were concerned she might
say something to the police.

10:04.297 --> 10:07.763
What? No, no, that's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

10:08.858 --> 10:11.765
Let's not get lost
in the who, what, and whens.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.945
The point is we did our
due diligence,

10:15.136 --> 10:18.549
and she didn't talk. She kept quiet.
She stood by you, Walt.

10:18.643 --> 10:20.538
Which, if you ask me,

10:20.539 --> 10:23.139
is the ironical
silver lining here.

10:23.173 --> 10:26.146
I mean, on the one hand,

10:26.181 --> 10:29.277
sure, she snuck off the reservation
to get some dirty, damp, and deep.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.384
You're fired!

10:48.770 --> 10:50.619
You're done!
Good.

10:50.654 --> 10:54.806
Oh, boo-hoo, I won't cook meth anymore.
You're a crybaby. Who needs you?

10:54.941 --> 10:58.413
Hey, I'm unplugging the Web site, so no more
money laundering. How do you like that?

10:58.448 --> 11:01.552
I want those bugs
out of my house today.

11:01.587 --> 11:03.262
I want them out now!

11:03.509 --> 11:07.013
Oh, you just bought
a $300 suit, psycho!

11:09.314 --> 11:10.614
<i>Door.</i>

11:16.816 --> 11:19.444
Great, drilled right into the stucco.

11:21.559 --> 11:25.155
Oh, a little bit of putty, you'll be fine.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.597
Just make sure you get
all of those things.

11:28.983 --> 11:30.263
A, these things cost $800 apiece.

11:30.276 --> 11:32.974
These things cost $800 apiece.

11:33.154 --> 11:35.060
B, you're not that interesting.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.414
So yeah,
I'll get all of them, Walter.

11:39.707 --> 11:41.390
Great line of work, by the way.

11:41.821 --> 11:43.831
Real upstanding field.

11:44.278 --> 11:46.361
Yep, well...

11:47.682 --> 11:49.239
I enjoy it.

11:58.514 --> 12:00.182
You're free to leave now.

12:00.794 --> 12:01.934
Anytime.

12:03.443 --> 12:05.765
You know, Walter,

12:06.554 --> 12:10.197
sometimes it doesn't hurt to have someone
watching your back.

13:28.656 --> 13:30.046
Mr. White?

13:36.058 --> 13:37.058
Hi.

13:39.548 --> 13:40.577
What's up?

13:44.811 --> 13:48.677
I can't begin to understand what
you're going through, Walt,

13:49.104 --> 13:51.538
with all of your health concerns

13:52.011 --> 13:53.929
and the stresses
you've been under.

13:54.288 --> 13:59.622
Still, as educators, there are certain
responsibilities we need to be meeting here

14:00.034 --> 14:03.413
to the school
and to the students themselves.

14:03.621 --> 14:04.978
Yeah, of course.

14:06.938 --> 14:09.079
Is this a Wheaten terrier?

14:11.622 --> 14:12.760
Uh, Norfolk.

14:13.859 --> 14:14.916
Norfolk?

14:16.080 --> 14:17.582
That's surprising.

14:18.872 --> 14:22.487
Walt, could you
come back over here and have a seat, please?

14:23.795 --> 14:24.795
Sure.

14:36.646 --> 14:39.191
You've been absent a lot
recently,

14:39.632 --> 14:42.260
and when you are here at school,

14:42.551 --> 14:44.718
there have been
some behavioral questions,

14:44.926 --> 14:47.082
and frankly I'm concerned.

14:50.816 --> 14:52.111
Hm. Thank you.

15:01.122 --> 15:02.787
Are you feeling okay?

15:03.622 --> 15:06.333
And do you think maybe
I should call Skyler?

15:08.899 --> 15:10.484
Um... nah.

15:15.752 --> 15:17.455
Let's just

15:18.678 --> 15:20.242
keep this...

15:22.803 --> 15:23.803
What?

15:24.102 --> 15:25.604
Hey!

15:27.172 --> 15:29.272
Walt, what's wrong with you?

16:10.736 --> 16:11.966
You know, look,

16:12.142 --> 16:14.997
you're the one who was
talking about D.C., okay?

16:15.032 --> 16:16.867
This is how you get there.

16:16.902 --> 16:19.852
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

16:22.863 --> 16:27.440
Besides, it's... you know, it's a
big deal to get picked for this.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.624
El Paso's like

16:30.773 --> 16:32.482
the Super Bowl.

16:34.264 --> 16:36.905
I could get killed crossing the street, okay? Whatever.

16:37.144 --> 16:40.334
I want to go.

16:41.248 --> 16:43.086
What about last time?

16:43.446 --> 16:45.496
What about last time?

17:08.276 --> 17:09.566
Schrader.

17:10.382 --> 17:12.132
Hey, Sheriff. Yeah.

17:15.321 --> 17:16.776
Blue, huh?

17:18.677 --> 17:20.160
Yeah, yeah.

17:20.195 --> 17:21.712
Thing is, uh...

17:22.579 --> 17:25.384
Thing is I'm supposed to be
getting on a plane right now.

17:30.521 --> 17:33.671
The stuff this guy had
was blue. You sure about that?

17:36.498 --> 17:37.498
Yeah.

17:39.402 --> 17:41.022
I want to talk to him.

17:44.419 --> 17:45.669
Taxi!

18:25.631 --> 18:28.403
Man, I'm sorry.
I needed to talk to you,

18:28.438 --> 18:30.488
but you weren't at your
apartment.

18:31.021 --> 18:33.232
No, I moved back home.

18:33.839 --> 18:35.793
That's good, right?

18:38.263 --> 18:40.239
Yo, did you just get fired?

18:40.249 --> 18:41.307
No!

18:41.614 --> 18:43.227
No. No, no, no, it's, uh...

18:44.705 --> 18:46.805
more like a sabbatical.

18:46.990 --> 18:48.901
Indefinite. Yeah.

19:03.188 --> 19:04.551
So

19:05.248 --> 19:06.356
What's up?

19:07.427 --> 19:08.875
Uh, should we go somewhere?

19:10.280 --> 19:11.999
No. This is fine.

19:16.180 --> 19:18.514
So, um, I want an intro
to your guy.

19:18.549 --> 19:19.739
What guy?

19:21.491 --> 19:23.640
Your guy.
Your distribution guy,

19:23.675 --> 19:27.535
The guy Saul hooked you up with. No,
no, no, no, no. Come on, Jesse.

19:27.570 --> 19:29.563
I thought about it,

19:29.846 --> 19:31.778
and I want to.

19:31.813 --> 19:33.636
It's the one thing I'm good at.

19:33.671 --> 19:36.253
No, that is just not true.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.351
You're good
at a lot of things, son.

19:39.307 --> 19:40.391
Like what?

19:43.844 --> 19:45.844
What about your sobriety?

19:46.676 --> 19:48.826
I told you. I'm not using.

19:49.819 --> 19:50.856
Ever.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.931
I just want

19:52.966 --> 19:54.632
back into the business.

19:58.890 --> 20:00.686
Well, I don't.

20:01.290 --> 20:02.698
I'm sorry.

20:03.024 --> 20:04.961
I know, and that's cool.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.491
I'm not asking you

20:06.526 --> 20:08.410
to cook.

20:10.984 --> 20:12.669
What's this?

20:13.305 --> 20:14.884
In the end,

20:15.070 --> 20:16.468
I just went

20:16.543 --> 20:20.394
with two reflux condensers. I didn't
want to lose track of my Ph levels,

20:20.429 --> 20:24.229
but I did everything else
just like you taught me.

20:26.597 --> 20:31.297
Super careful in my amounts and watched
the numbers every step of the way.

20:32.738 --> 20:34.247
So what do you think?

20:34.565 --> 20:36.114
It's good, right?

20:38.771 --> 20:39.821
What

20:40.520 --> 20:41.728
in the hell

20:42.533 --> 20:43.803
is this?

20:44.840 --> 20:45.946
What?

20:46.218 --> 20:48.328
What? This. This.

20:48.363 --> 20:50.122
This is my product.

20:50.157 --> 20:52.404
This is my formula.
This is mine.

20:52.439 --> 20:55.488
Okay, it's our product,

20:56.140 --> 20:59.629
but yeah, I was going to cut you in.
You were going to cut me in?

20:59.664 --> 21:01.998
No, no, no. I cut you in.

21:02.033 --> 21:05.977
What the hell is your problem? All
I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

21:06.012 --> 21:08.319
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

21:11.075 --> 21:16.186
Because I am not going to lend my name to an inferior product.
I mean, look at the diameters here.

21:16.664 --> 21:18.378
What did you use for reduction?

21:18.615 --> 21:19.699
Don't tell me.

21:19.734 --> 21:21.534
Platinum dioxide, right?

21:21.743 --> 21:24.692
No. Mercury-aluminum
amalgam.

21:25.010 --> 21:27.610
The dioxide's
too hard to keep wet.

21:28.292 --> 21:30.690
All right, well, you must've
done it wrong, then.

21:30.725 --> 21:34.747
Your color is all cloudy, so you were
struggling with distillation, too.

21:34.782 --> 21:37.476
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

21:37.708 --> 21:39.958
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

21:40.172 --> 21:41.255
What?

21:42.386 --> 21:46.814
No way. I gave out samples, and
everyone said it was the bomb.

21:47.356 --> 21:49.506
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

21:49.986 --> 21:51.778
And who are they? I wonder.

21:51.813 --> 21:53.826
Huh? A bunch of meth heads?
Yeah.

21:53.861 --> 21:56.315
They should know, right?

21:56.350 --> 21:58.215
Yeah, well, sorry. I can't help you.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.626
Fine, asswad. You know what?
I'll contact the guy myself.

22:01.661 --> 22:04.583
Oh, yeah? Good luck with that
because my guy is a pro,

22:04.618 --> 22:07.215
and he doesn't deal with junkies.
You know what?

22:07.250 --> 22:10.033
Eat me.
Anytime, loser. Hey. Hey!

22:10.068 --> 22:12.638
Hey. Hey!

22:51.251 --> 22:54.051
I can't believe
it's only 4:00.

22:54.890 --> 22:57.905
This day is dragging.

23:37.946 --> 23:39.496
Mm. I wish I could stay.

23:40.628 --> 23:41.993
So stay.

23:45.510 --> 23:47.060
What's stopping you?

23:50.137 --> 23:52.661
What? Like everything,
you mean?

23:53.261 --> 23:57.111
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

23:59.899 --> 24:01.649
So move in here.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.758
And then my son

24:05.689 --> 24:07.295
hating me even more.

24:09.065 --> 24:11.771
Nah. It'll pass. I went through that
with the girls.

24:11.806 --> 24:12.906
They adapt.

24:13.654 --> 24:18.047
And now everyone at work thinks I'm an evil,
ladder-climbing whore.

24:18.347 --> 24:21.047
They're all fired
effective immediately.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.293
What else?

24:24.239 --> 24:26.821
Oh, aren't you the answer man.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.378
Where did it...

24:36.346 --> 24:38.996
Where did it go wrong,
exactly... you and Walt?

24:43.960 --> 24:46.852
I mean, I always saw him
as kind of...

24:50.216 --> 24:51.616
mild-mannered.

24:52.786 --> 24:55.836
Something, I don't know, change
when he got sick, or...?

24:58.451 --> 25:00.451
I don't know what changed, Ted,

25:01.236 --> 25:04.973
and I just don't feel really comfortable
talking about it.

25:05.221 --> 25:06.317
Sorry.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.563
Just asking
out of self-interest.

25:10.598 --> 25:13.498
Got to make sure I don't
make the same mistake.

25:15.325 --> 25:16.885
I would be amazed.

25:20.195 --> 25:23.015
Just let me see if I'm
following you here, Russell.

25:23.050 --> 25:25.140
You got this stuff

25:25.175 --> 25:27.792
from some guy at Gasparza's

25:28.144 --> 25:30.544
who was wearing tan pants

25:30.963 --> 25:33.863
and who you're 80% sure had a mustache.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.893
That's it, right?

25:35.928 --> 25:39.078
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

25:46.547 --> 25:47.718
Russell.

25:49.056 --> 25:50.952
Everything all right in there?

25:53.004 --> 25:54.100
Mel.

25:54.528 --> 25:56.435
The dude's name was Mel.

25:57.044 --> 25:58.692
Well, there you go. See?

25:58.927 --> 26:01.310
You served
an actual earthly function.

26:01.345 --> 26:03.333
I can't believe
I remembered that.

26:03.368 --> 26:04.595
Mel who?

26:05.154 --> 26:06.396
Does he have a last name?

26:07.664 --> 26:09.317
Yeah, uh,

26:09.352 --> 26:10.461
Mel.

26:11.516 --> 26:12.615
Wait.

26:14.312 --> 26:15.488
Was it Mel?

26:16.763 --> 26:17.922
Um... Mark.

26:19.349 --> 26:21.499
It was definitely an "M" name

26:21.534 --> 26:23.560
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

26:23.677 --> 26:25.491
Wait, wait.

26:28.226 --> 26:29.357
Yeah.

26:30.712 --> 26:32.099
It's gone.

26:33.330 --> 26:34.380
It's gone.

26:34.715 --> 26:36.565
It was an "M" name, though.

26:37.118 --> 26:39.580
I remember the "muh" sound.

26:42.043 --> 26:44.743
We'll go with the "muh" sound.

26:46.123 --> 26:47.952
Thanks a lot. Yeah.
Appreciate it.

26:47.987 --> 26:49.887
He definitely had tan pants.

26:53.260 --> 26:55.410
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

26:55.445 --> 26:59.341
Okay, it's after 9, so this bar
that Girl George is at, probably wall-to-wall

26:59.376 --> 27:02.312
dirtbags by now. Let's go have
a little looky-loo,

27:02.347 --> 27:05.497
see if we can't find
this M-named clown.

27:09.292 --> 27:10.491
What?

27:10.526 --> 27:11.776
It's a lead.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.369
Lead to what?

27:13.404 --> 27:14.654
To Heisenberg.

27:14.926 --> 27:18.415
I told you it was only a matter of
time before this guy booted up again.

27:18.496 --> 27:19.996
Here we go, my friend.

27:20.838 --> 27:22.721
Don't hate me
because I'm beautiful, Gomie.

27:22.756 --> 27:25.256
Just apologize and buy me a beer.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.462
Man, you're reaching.

27:29.034 --> 27:31.077
This stuff could be a knockoff

27:31.112 --> 27:33.120
or left over from an older cook.

27:33.155 --> 27:36.060
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

27:36.929 --> 27:39.676
How do I know?

27:39.711 --> 27:40.911
Because I know.

27:41.821 --> 27:43.313
I don't get it.

27:43.348 --> 27:46.446
This is the reason
why you're blowing off the task force?

27:46.887 --> 27:48.687
Chase down teeners?

27:49.710 --> 27:52.310
I'm getting tired
of all the second guessing.

27:52.999 --> 27:56.085
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation,

27:56.756 --> 27:59.330
do us both a favor
and ask for a transfer.

27:59.365 --> 28:01.265
What is up with you lately?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.530
Starting bar fights?

28:03.634 --> 28:05.498
Turning down El Paso?

28:05.625 --> 28:07.175
And now this bullshit?

28:07.382 --> 28:10.032
Do you need to talk
to someone or what?

28:10.683 --> 28:12.233
Talk to someone?

28:13.249 --> 28:14.549
Talk to who?

28:18.667 --> 28:21.717
I'm not trying to step
on your toes, bro. Okay?

28:22.858 --> 28:25.382
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

28:25.417 --> 28:28.050
Appreciate that... bro.

28:29.684 --> 28:31.984
Now take your hand
off my shoulder.

28:46.653 --> 28:48.811
Yeah, yeah,
the one that was on TV.

28:48.846 --> 28:51.475
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

28:51.934 --> 28:55.120
I'm not looking for an entire
wing here, Mr. Linkas.

28:55.155 --> 28:57.184
It could be a nut or a bolt.

28:57.219 --> 29:01.588
It could be a bag of peanuts,

29:01.720 --> 29:04.511
Oh, no, no, no. Closed. Uh, calling you back.

29:04.932 --> 29:08.239
You had your chance. I told you to get him
cooking again,

29:08.274 --> 29:11.581
and you blew it off, and now it's too late.
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

29:11.892 --> 29:14.467
All I wanted was to show
you two your potential,

29:14.502 --> 29:16.883
and what do I get in return?
A bone contusion.

29:16.918 --> 29:19.768
You want to see the scar?
I wish you two had...

29:21.000 --> 29:22.148
Hi, there.

29:23.265 --> 29:26.276
How in the hell did you get Walt to...
I made it.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.732
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

30:04.590 --> 30:08.037
Uh, good news is,
for a stage three cancer, the guy's doing well

30:08.264 --> 30:09.364
physically.

30:09.820 --> 30:12.123
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

30:12.158 --> 30:15.058
He's gone off the rails over this thing
with his wife.

30:15.851 --> 30:20.001
My opinion,
he's not coming back, not on his own.

30:24.312 --> 30:27.711
Your friends were
at his place again, by the way.

30:27.746 --> 30:30.846
They drew something on the street
outside his house.

30:31.570 --> 30:32.811
The scythe.

30:33.107 --> 30:34.219
Animals.

30:35.486 --> 30:37.158
Does the lawyer know?
Should he?

30:37.193 --> 30:38.240
No.

30:40.776 --> 30:43.326
If you want this guy
to produce again,

30:43.596 --> 30:44.824
why not just tell him?

30:45.101 --> 30:47.615
You're the only thing that stands
between him and an ax in the head.

30:47.650 --> 30:49.963
I don't believe fear to be
an effective motivator.

30:50.337 --> 30:51.987
I want investment.

30:52.703 --> 30:54.965
For now, I'm simply
interested in time frame.

30:56.290 --> 30:58.428
He will live for the
foreseeable future, yes?

30:59.538 --> 31:03.761
Mm, foreseeable, couple years at least,
barring acts of God and men with axes.

31:06.721 --> 31:10.828
Oh, from the lawyer, I'm supposed to let you
know the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

31:11.799 --> 31:15.085
I don't work with junkies.
That's what I thought you'd say.

31:15.527 --> 31:16.984
Probably for the best.

31:17.567 --> 31:19.962
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

31:22.064 --> 31:24.396
Really?
That's what Goodman says.

31:24.552 --> 31:26.016
Cats and dogs.

31:29.181 --> 31:30.181
Do the deal.

32:57.941 --> 33:00.260
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

33:01.450 --> 33:05.242
<i>Agent Schrader, you need to be
calling me back ASAP. Clear?</i>

33:05.272 --> 33:07.944
<i>I've got Texas breathing down
my neck, and I'm not about...</i>

33:30.609 --> 33:34.239
Yeah, I haven't see Matt

33:34.582 --> 33:35.952
Where can I find him, you think?

33:36.316 --> 33:39.402
No idea. I haven't seen him...
I know. You said that a few times.

33:39.789 --> 33:41.564
Yeah, because I haven't seen him.

33:41.846 --> 33:43.303
I don't know what else to say.

33:48.058 --> 33:49.558
What's your name, darling?

33:50.027 --> 33:51.027
Cara.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.592
Where did this come from, Cara?

34:01.273 --> 34:02.273
I... I don't know.

34:03.481 --> 34:05.579
What is it? Drugs?

34:08.865 --> 34:11.022
Look, I'm just going to come
right out and say it.

34:12.394 --> 34:14.653
Um, you're a bad liar, Cara.

34:15.278 --> 34:16.561
Don't get me wrong.

34:17.174 --> 34:18.935
Not the worst I've ever seen.

34:20.170 --> 34:24.194
Once had a guy try to explain
the dope balloon up his butt

34:24.224 --> 34:26.551
on bad Thai food.

34:27.067 --> 34:29.176
Still, you're not
a very good liar.

34:30.791 --> 34:33.031
I honestly don't know Stop.

34:33.997 --> 34:35.584
You look like a good kid.

34:36.095 --> 34:40.121
I'm not hereto get you in trouble, but you need
to tell me where this came from right now!

34:45.308 --> 34:48.883
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

34:50.108 --> 34:53.124
I tried it, and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

34:53.154 --> 34:54.595
Okay, and who gave it to you?

34:54.625 --> 34:57.325
Some guy, he came in
a couple days ago

34:58.152 --> 35:01.823
and wanted to trade it for gas.
Some guy? W-What's his name?

35:03.214 --> 35:04.424
Okay, w...

35:05.221 --> 35:06.504
What did he look like?

35:08.955 --> 35:10.435
I don't know. Um...

35:11.565 --> 35:12.761
He looked pretty normal.

35:13.038 --> 35:14.450
You know? Um, white...

35:18.742 --> 35:21.767
I think his hair
was lightish brown.

35:23.340 --> 35:25.256
He had really blue eyes.

35:25.881 --> 35:27.797
They were really, really blue.

35:28.398 --> 35:30.253
He's dreamy.
Okay, w-w-what else?

35:30.535 --> 35:32.088
Piercings, jewelery,

35:32.593 --> 35:35.572
distinctive articles of clothing?

35:37.151 --> 35:38.151
Come on.

35:40.187 --> 35:41.187
Listen to me.

35:42.164 --> 35:45.882
It's real important that I find the person
that had these drugs,

35:46.056 --> 35:48.577
so if you can remember
anything else about him...

35:49.730 --> 35:51.606
Come on.

35:57.515 --> 35:59.249
He drove an RV.

36:00.126 --> 36:01.659
Okay, good, good.

36:01.961 --> 36:06.183
What can you remember? What kind of RV?
What color? Did you spot a license plate?

36:07.185 --> 36:08.946
I don't knot the kinds,

36:09.585 --> 36:11.507
and I didn't see the license,

36:13.544 --> 36:17.746
but the color was, I think,
white, brownish color.

36:20.575 --> 36:22.290
I'm sorry.

36:22.945 --> 36:25.557
I know I'm not helping you,
but...

36:38.965 --> 36:40.074
Cara.

36:42.374 --> 36:43.657
Please tell me

36:44.512 --> 36:46.360
that that camera works.

37:00.733 --> 37:01.762
Damn it.

37:59.156 --> 38:00.265
Bingo.

38:20.998 --> 38:22.803
These eggs are good, Mom.

38:23.922 --> 38:25.334
Thanks.

38:27.351 --> 38:30.229
Hey, you know what's weird?
Dad's Web site.

38:30.259 --> 38:33.172
It's been three days
since the last donation.

38:35.772 --> 38:36.974
Yeah, well...

38:39.083 --> 38:40.757
people lose interest.

38:54.973 --> 38:57.763
So how long are you off for?

39:02.250 --> 39:03.650
A few weeks.

39:04.561 --> 39:06.174
Uh, we'll play it by ear.

39:09.611 --> 39:11.080
I probably...

39:12.111 --> 39:15.205
pushed it, you know,
going back to work so soon.

39:24.389 --> 39:28.686
Think... Think I can get a ride today?
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

39:32.311 --> 39:33.405
Uh... yeah.

39:37.608 --> 39:41.826
Hey, so Dad can
babysit now. Right?

39:43.670 --> 39:47.186
You won't have to take
Holly to work every day.

39:56.248 --> 39:58.608
Sometime, maybe.

40:01.428 --> 40:02.659
We'll see.

40:45.521 --> 40:47.130
What's up?

40:51.958 --> 40:54.543
I think you'll
seriously enjoy, yo.

41:09.345 --> 41:10.595
Wait.

41:11.298 --> 41:14.282
No, no. No. Wait.

41:16.676 --> 41:17.801
Hey!

41:18.911 --> 41:20.129
Hey!

41:21.629 --> 41:22.801
Hey!

41:23.785 --> 41:26.098
What the hell?
This is only half.

41:26.161 --> 41:28.301
That's right.
It's your half.

41:32.445 --> 41:34.989
Where's the other half, bitch?

41:36.363 --> 41:39.707
I mean, it was, uh...
The whole thing was crazy, man.

41:39.941 --> 41:44.379
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him. He actually
thought we were the cable guys, you know?

41:46.863 --> 41:48.874
Anyway, uh, um,

41:49.004 --> 41:51.046
sorry about those miscalls,
Chief.

41:51.191 --> 41:53.926
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

41:54.848 --> 41:58.218
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?
Hell, yes!

41:58.801 --> 42:00.925
With pointed boots and bells on.

42:00.957 --> 42:02.926
Just I got this break
in the Heisenberg case.

42:02.988 --> 42:06.029
The blue meth, you mean?
The teenth?

42:06.122 --> 42:08.296
Yeah, well, that teenth
got things rolling.

42:08.812 --> 42:11.846
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
At's where I got these.

42:12.157 --> 42:15.921
Now, the station's, uh, closed circuit,
uh, was down... surprise, surprise...

42:16.096 --> 42:20.705
but I was able to pull some of these
snapshots off an ATM security camera.

42:21.298 --> 42:23.957
Hey, now, I always thought these guys might be
camper cooking, right?

42:23.981 --> 42:26.658
First off, your typical
Class C motor home

42:26.682 --> 42:29.846
is going to grunt
at least 5,000 pounds of interior fixtures, okay?

42:29.882 --> 42:33.581
5,000 pounds at least, okay?

42:34.143 --> 42:36.439
See how high that
suspension's riding?

42:36.897 --> 42:40.065
No way, no how, this thing's
carrying that kind of weight.

42:40.143 --> 42:43.893
I mean, this thing has been cleared out
and stripped down to its tight and curlies.

42:43.989 --> 42:45.151
For what?

42:45.820 --> 42:47.235
Blood bank?

42:47.629 --> 42:49.073
Maybe a bookmobile?

42:50.805 --> 42:53.171
There's no clear view
of the plates.

42:53.817 --> 42:56.190
Yeah, well, you can only
get so lucky, right?

42:56.282 --> 42:58.202
But the fact that there's
no front plate

42:58.220 --> 43:00.245
tells me its likely
New Mexico registration.

43:00.269 --> 43:01.501
I checked with DMV.

43:01.525 --> 43:05.177
There are only 29 of these early '80s
Bounders registered in the state.

43:08.100 --> 43:10.330
Only 29?
Yeah.

43:11.282 --> 43:13.977
So I got to go, uh,
you know, knock on some doors.

43:22.268 --> 43:24.948
They need you in El Paso, Hank.
You bet. I... I...

43:26.087 --> 43:28.236
I'm just going to wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first

43:28.259 --> 43:31.893
So you're refusing the assignment.
No, I'm not. I'll go.

43:32.204 --> 43:35.393
It's just I need some more time.
You're not hearing me, Agent Schrader.

43:36.014 --> 43:37.393
You're out of time.

43:38.574 --> 43:41.080
Are you going to El Paso now?

43:41.427 --> 43:42.549
Tonight?

43:47.328 --> 43:49.080
Just a simple yes or no.

43:56.449 --> 43:57.482
No.

43:59.512 --> 44:00.525
I can't.

44:03.713 --> 44:08.749
But that's only because
I'm really close to something big here.

44:19.541 --> 44:21.405
Better get to it, then.

44:46.632 --> 44:50.101
<i>This is KECA 480,
Albuquerque news radio.</i>

44:50.132 --> 44:52.429
<i>KECA news time 10:13.</i>

44:52.495 --> 44:55.039
