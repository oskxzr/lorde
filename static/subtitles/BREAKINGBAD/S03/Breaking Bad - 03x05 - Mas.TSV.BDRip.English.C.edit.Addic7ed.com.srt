2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,800
I am awake.

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:14,472
You are not how I remember you
from class. I mean, like, not at all.

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,484
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand,
all right? My guy wants 85.

5
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:31,072
This is all the money I have
in the world.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,617
You are a drug dealer. Negotiate.

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,912
Buy the RV.

8
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,416
We start tomorrow.

9
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:54,429
Work it, work it, baby.
Yo, this is sick, brother.

10
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,180
Totally. God.

11
00:00:56,348 --> 00:01:01,269
Yo, Jesse, I got these two fine ladies
who wanna participate.

12
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:04,689
- You got the funds?
- Oh, I got the funds. Hey.

13
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,275
Would you ladies like to meet
my fat stack?

14
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:10,778
Get in here.

15
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,865
Come on.

16
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,783
Hey, yo, yo.

17
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:19,036
Yo, you got champagne?
None of that cheap stuff.

18
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,039
I want the expensive shit.
Don Pérignon.

19
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,583
It's 400 a bottle.

20
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,253
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll only have two.

21
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,632
Oh, and I want the tall, skinny glasses.
I like those skinny glasses.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,429
That's what James Bond drinks.
Mofos, I'm all about that.

23
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:40,433
Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask.

24
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,729
- Where did you get all the cheddar?
- Must be moving mad volume.

25
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,898
It's funny.
You wanna know what's funny?

26
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,776
- What's funny?
- This old dude, he gave it to me.

27
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,152
- What?
- He gave it to me.

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,904
It's his entire life savings.

29
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,908
- What? Why?
- Because he's a dumb-ass. That's why.

30
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,493
Oh, God.

31
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,413
Yes!

32
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,208
All right, living large, players.

33
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,066
Thank you. Yo, thank you.

34
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:17,071
- Thank you.
- That was...

35
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,996
Awesome, bro.

36
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,498
Later.

37
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,834
Oh, man.

38
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,378
Oh, I'm so dead.

39
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,090
I only got... Oh, damn.

40
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,013
I only got, like, 1400.

41
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,683
Waffle House? Yeah.

42
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,768
No, man.

43
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,105
Supposed to use that dude's money
to buy an RV.

44
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:56,360
- What do you want with a RV for?
- Because, like...

45
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,613
Because, like...

46
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,282
Never mind.

47
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,700
Jesus.

48
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:08,539
Now I gotta, like, leave town
or change my identity or something.

49
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,250
Guy's blackmailing me.

50
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,963
He's got, like, a criminal mind, yo.

51
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,132
RV, yeah?

52
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,386
I can hook you up, bro.
I can totally get you an RV.

53
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:27,934
- No, I need it today. Now.
- No problem. Let's go.

54
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,562
You're telling me
you can get me an RV?

55
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,814
For 1400, at 6 in the morning?

56
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,693
Right on.

57
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,736
So do I need to sign something?

58
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,407
No, it's, like,
a no-paperwork-type deal.

59
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,038
Pleasure doing business with you.

60
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,375
Come on, we gotta bounce.

61
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,669
- What?
- For real, yo. Get it out of here.

62
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,348
Oh, my God, I love this floor.

63
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,853
This feels fantastic.

64
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,564
Can you control the temperature?

65
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,401
Yeah. There should be a switch
right next to you there.

66
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,862
It's a thermostat.

67
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:54,038
Ted, this has gotta be...

68
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:58,459
...the most amazing invention ever.

69
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,712
I know. Contractor talked me into it.

70
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,966
Seemed kind of extravagant, but...

71
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,804
I gotta tell you, once you try it,
you can't go back.

72
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,809
I can never find anything
in this Buick.

73
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,941
You know, you could leave
a few things here if you want.

74
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,176
- Why don't you go get your dad?
- Sure.

75
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,602
Hey, Dad.

76
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,857
- Dad?
- Yeah.

77
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,609
Mom's asking.

78
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,820
Wanna come to dinner?

79
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,698
Yeah, I'll be right there.

80
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,956
You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

81
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,292
Yeah, right, like you don't know.

82
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,878
- What did I just say?
- Give me the phone. Give it.

83
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,214
Like you didn't make some deal
behind my back.

84
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,175
Correct. I did not.

85
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,177
I was sitting at a stoplight...

86
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,388
...minding my own business,
when the man... The man...

87
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,683
The kid threw a bag of money
through my window.

88
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,852
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

89
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,812
- Let me talk to him.
- I owe you?

90
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,898
I owe you nothing.

91
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,317
And I will get to the bottom of this.
Trust me.

92
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,485
Trust you? Trust you?
That's a good one.

93
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,196
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

94
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,240
You wanna talk about trust, Jesse?
Let's talk about trust.

95
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,077
I told you not to cook my formula,
and you went ahead and did it anyway.

96
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,831
Because I never said I wouldn't cook it
because it ain't yours. It's ours.

97
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,041
Plural, bitch.

98
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,044
You did not have my permission.

99
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,880
All I know is I got half the money
I'm due...

100
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,548
...and you got the rest.

101
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,342
Escalating. You're escalating.

102
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,179
You know what? Escalate this.
My meth, my money!

103
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:20,643
I will be a one-man glass factory.
I will rock that RV 24...

104
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,751
It's buttoned up tight.
Can't see a damn thing.

105
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,670
I ain't feeling it.

106
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:34,300
No smoke, no smell, no waste.
There's no cook.

107
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,512
Could be they're setting up.
I heard movement inside.

108
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,849
I say we call it a night,
come back with a search warrant.

109
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,727
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

110
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,313
There's gotta be a way.

111
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,358
There's gotta be a way.
There's gotta be a way...

112
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,324
Hey, hey, hey.

113
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,068
What are you doing?

114
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,545
- No, no, no.
- What the hell are you doing up there?

115
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,423
Are you some kind of a pervert?

116
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,551
Yeah,
because we were here last year.

117
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,263
Sorry. I appreciate...

118
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,766
Going after the bad guys.

119
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,854
I'm sorry and enjoy the rest
of your vacation. Okay?

120
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,239
Go back to your trailers.
Everything's okay.

121
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,286
Guy's VFW. He's cool.

122
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,289
We're gonna check out a couple more
and call it a morning.

123
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,959
- Okay, what do you say?
- Can't. Gotta get home.

124
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,337
Why, you leave your balls
in your wife's purse or what?

125
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,339
Gotta pack.

126
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,551
Where you headed?

127
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,221
Texas.

128
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,492
Hey there.

129
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:08,471
Hank?

130
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,473
Can I come in?

131
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,602
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

132
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,938
- How did it go last night?
- Good.

133
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,107
Catch the bad guys?

134
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,860
Nope.

135
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,323
- Want me to make you breakfast?
- No. I'm...

136
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,034
I'm heading back out after this.

137
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,454
Now? You worked all night.

138
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,373
Get some sleep, Hank.
Those RVs aren't going anywhere.

139
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,294
They're recreational vehicles, Marie.
That's what they do.

140
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,296
You know what I mean.

141
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,300
I spoke with Blanca.

142
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:08,222
She said
that Steven's going to El Paso?

143
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,518
Yeah.

144
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:17,064
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

145
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,527
- I turned it down. End of story.
- Good. Good.

146
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,362
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.

147
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,823
I needed some time here because
I'm deep into this investigation...

148
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,409
...and couldn't do both...

149
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,912
...so I made a judgment call.

150
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,838
You know that you can talk to me
about things, right?

151
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,591
You don't have
to go through this alone.

152
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,263
Do you ask me which lead bib
to put on someone...

153
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,098
...before you nuke them?

154
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,724
Jesus, Marie.

155
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,396
I made a decision.
I'm not going through anything.

156
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,606
Doing my job.

157
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,234
- I would like...
- I know. I know.

158
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,027
A condo in Georgetown. I know.

159
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,948
If you would let me finish,
I was going to say...

160
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,286
...I'd like to be included. That's all.

161
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:16,498
Don't you worry about my career.
My career is just fine.

162
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,544
Did you not wanna go?

163
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,631
I don't blame you. I just...

164
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,093
- Aren't you late for work or something?
- After what happened...

165
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,179
...it would make perfect sense
for you to not wanna go back.

166
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,890
I'm onto some important stuff
right here, right now.

167
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,978
Mexico doesn't have a damn thing to
do with it. Anyone who doubts that...

168
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,397
I mean, I'm doing
some actual good out here...

169
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,734
...and all I get
are these bullshit accusations!

170
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,903
What, everyone thinks
I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.

171
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,822
But I'm onto something. I know it.

172
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,116
You understand me?

173
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,660
You hear me?

174
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,338
What exactly is this?

175
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,762
I'll tell you what I think it is.

176
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,185
A ploy.
A ploy to get me cooking again.

177
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,936
And an obvious one at that.

178
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,064
How do you mean?

179
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:27,778
As if I would seriously believe
you would hire an addict.

180
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,364
Jesse Pinkman? Recovering or not.

181
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,700
You vouched for him previously.
I took you at your word.

182
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:38,664
No. No, no, no. Let me be clear.
Let me be perfectly clear.

183
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,834
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

184
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:47,381
Trusting him with a solo venture...

185
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,884
...well, that's quite another matter.

186
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,471
How he could possibly
produce anything...

187
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,641
...other than a mediocre product
at best.

188
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,311
I am told his product
was more or less consistent...

189
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,189
...with the quality
I had come to expect.

190
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,733
More or less?

191
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,404
More or less? Really?

192
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,535
Boy, that is the...
Talk about setting the bar low.

193
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,417
Except you don't do that,
set the bar low.

194
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:30,006
Therefore,
what conclusion am I left to draw?

195
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,512
That you believe I have some
proprietary kind of selfishness...

196
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,848
...about my own formula.

197
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:43,520
Some sort of overweening pride,
I suppose...

198
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:48,442
...that you think
simply overwhelms me...

199
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,403
...clouds my judgment.

200
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,198
- But it doesn't.
- Absolutely not.

201
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,201
I simply respect the chemistry.

202
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,957
The chemistry must be respected.

203
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,920
I apologize for being so transparent.

204
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:17,429
Would you take a drive with me?
I'd like to show you something.

205
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,516
Hi. Is everything okay?

206
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,144
She's already finished an entire bottle,
but she still seemed hungry.

207
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,813
Then she fell asleep.

208
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,857
But I was thinking I'd give her another
when she wakes up.

209
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,109
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

210
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,738
- Fatten that baby up.
- Will do.

211
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,286
Was that it?

212
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,622
So where are you? Are you at work?

213
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,334
Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.
I shouldn't be much longer.

214
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,963
- Is that okay?
- You know I love my little pookums.

215
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,549
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years...

216
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,717
...as far as I'm concerned.

217
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,638
Great. Thanks, Marie.

218
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,269
Are you sure you're okay?

219
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:52,399
Sweetie, what is it? Come on.

220
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:56,736
- It's Hank.
- Hank? What about him?

221
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:02,075
I don't know how to talk to him.

222
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:06,037
I don't know what to say to him
anymore. I don't know how to...

223
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,376
Ever since El Paso, ever since...
Maybe before...

224
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:16,172
Yeah. God knows
he went through a lot down there.

225
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,719
People blown up right in front of him,
blood everywhere...

226
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,181
...and last week,
El Paso said they want him back.

227
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,391
Yeah?

228
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,395
He's not going. Steve Gomez
is going in his place...

229
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,691
...and I don't know
how I feel about that.

230
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,069
Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here,
isn't he?

231
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,948
Of course, and I want him safe.

232
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:46,411
But I can't tell what he wants.
He won't talk to me.

233
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,539
He hardly even comes home.
He works all day, all night.

234
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,292
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.

235
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,462
It's like something's
eating him away from inside.

236
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,591
He's just not the same. He's not.

237
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:05,305
Facing death, it changes a person.
It has to, don't you think?

238
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:09,434
I guess you've noticed
a change in Walt.

239
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,676
Please.

240
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,754
What is this?

241
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,258
Your new lab.

242
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,881
My God.

243
00:23:55,643 --> 00:24:00,730
Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.

244
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,486
Look at the size
of this reaction vessel.

245
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:10,824
Oh, it's got...
It's gotta be 1200 liters.

246
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,161
Where...? Where...?

247
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:19,499
How did you know
how to put this all together?

248
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:23,461
I had excellent help, as will you.

249
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,008
Quite a lot of planning went into this.

250
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,553
I would say so.

251
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,598
The laundry upstairs,
I've owned it for years.

252
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,685
It receives large chemical deliveries
on a weekly basis...

253
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,186
...detergents and such.

254
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,356
There is nothing suspicious
about it...

255
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:48,486
...and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

256
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,115
The filtration system
is state-of-the-art.

257
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,535
It will vent nothing
but clean, odorless steam...

258
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,537
...just as the laundry does...

259
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,582
...and through the very same stacks.

260
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:07,463
I need 200 pounds per week
to make this economically viable.

261
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,050
You would choose your own hours,
of course...

262
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,344
...come and go as you please...

263
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,972
...so long as the quota is met.

264
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,411
Sorry.

265
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,414
The answer is still no.

266
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:52,091
I have made a series
of very bad decisions...

267
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,594
...and I cannot make another one.

268
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,721
Why did you make these decisions?

269
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,265
For the good of my family.

270
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,269
Then they weren't bad decisions.

271
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,566
What does a man do, Walter?

272
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,447
A man provides for his family.

273
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,450
This cost me my family.

274
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:20,286
When you have children,
you always have family.

275
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,790
They will always be your priority,
your responsibility.

276
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:28,670
And a man... A man provides.

277
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,467
And he does it
even when he's not appreciated...

278
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,219
...or respected...

279
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,597
...or even loved.

280
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:44,435
He simply bears up, and he does it...

281
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,106
...because he's a man.

282
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:11,296
Any chance
we could grab a quick bite?

283
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,090
Thai place around the corner's
pretty good.

284
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,844
I really gotta head home.

285
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,014
All right, rain check, then.

286
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,245
She said it was the tofu.

287
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:50,543
Whatever. She's still cute anyways.

288
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,051
Great dinner, Mom.

289
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,767
Can I be excused?

290
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,561
To do homework
or to play video games?

291
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,355
I can multitask.

292
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,733
Yeah.

293
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,617
You wanna take her?

294
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,461
Yeah.

295
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,441
Give me something, Andy. Come on.

296
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,535
Welded onto the back of a house.
Well, that's classy.

297
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,038
Christ.

298
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,958
Okay. Okay, thanks.

299
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,805
Hey, Janice. Janice.

300
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,352
That the last one?

301
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,396
Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had.

302
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:01,567
Twenty-nine early '80s Bounders
registered in New Mexico.

303
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,696
- Could you check again?
- Now?

304
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,742
- Can I do it after the party?
- Janice, I'm...

305
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,410
I'm dead in the water here.

306
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,580
Okay, I'll check.

307
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,921
Hey, how are you guys doing?

308
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,512
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean it
really good, I tell you.

309
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,264
All good.

310
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,559
- Gomey.
- Yeah.

311
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,853
Time for the little bird to fly the nest,
huh?

312
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,608
The right guy for the job, seeing as
the bean-speak comes natural and all.

313
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,070
Wanna know how to say
"get bent" in Spanish?

314
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,781
Just don't go native on me, all right?

315
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,121
Hey.

316
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,040
Here.

317
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,295
Know your enemy and all.

318
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,640
- Fight the good fight, brother.
- I will.

319
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,894
Who got a drink around here?

320
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:31,949
Your hunch was right. One more RV.

321
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,327
DMV said the registration
wasn't renewed...

322
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:38,581
...but then they realized it was never
filed as non-operational or destroyed.

323
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:41,125
No police report, either.

324
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,881
I just don't know what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

325
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,759
It's like I'm paralyzed...

326
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,345
...like if I take a step
in any direction...

327
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:21,350
...I'm gonna make
a spectacular mistake.

328
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:26,272
God, I could go
for a glass of wine about now.

329
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,858
You wanna go to...?

330
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,443
Sorry, never mind.

331
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,281
Anyway...

332
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:39,952
...breaking news is
I am sleeping with my boss...

333
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,872
...and I don't know why.

334
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,374
Yep.

335
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:53,382
That's a lie. I do know why.

336
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,137
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

337
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,807
He's a really good person...

338
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,102
...but, I mean,
it's not like we're ever gonna...

339
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,941
Somehow,
and I can't actually believe it...

340
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:16,155
...but my entire family
sees me as some sort of...

341
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,659
My own sister, my brother-in-law.

342
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:24,079
My teenage son...

343
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,415
...tells me I'm a bitch.

344
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,253
And you say tell him the truth.

345
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,007
Tell him about his father...

346
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,927
...but I can't.

347
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,221
Ever.

348
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,640
How could I?

349
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,226
And this man that I'm seeing,
you know...

350
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,645
...as wrong as I know it is...

351
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:51,106
...as much as I know I'm probably
doing it to make Walt leave me...

352
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:57,988
...it is the only thing in my day
where I don't feel...

353
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,618
...like I'm...

354
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,038
...drowning.

355
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,837
So he knows about this other man?

356
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,463
Yeah.

357
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,800
So then he'll sign?

358
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:23,138
Walt says he's not going anywhere...

359
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,768
...so that's a really brilliant
gambit on my part. Yep.

360
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,145
Genius.

361
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,490
He keeps money in the house.

362
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,245
Your husband, the drug dealer?

363
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,539
How much money?

364
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:53,043
I didn't count it. It's heavy.

365
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:58,173
A bag, where he keeps it.

366
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:03,387
Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

367
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,681
No. God, no. I just...

368
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,183
No, I'm just, you know...

369
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,770
I'm just trying to just talk it through.
That's...

370
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,106
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified...

371
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:18,110
...and twice the price of a therapist.
There is nothing to discuss here.

372
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:22,281
I'm just saying, you know?
We have a history.

373
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,367
He's the father of my children...

374
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,287
...and maybe what he did, he...

375
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,623
He did it for the family. Right?

376
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,791
Well, guess what.

377
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,628
That is one enormous load
of horse shit.

378
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,129
Okay.

379
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,132
I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

380
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:45,471
You are a fool to stay in that house
one minute longer.

381
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,973
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

382
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,392
You are now an accessory
after the fact.

383
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,810
You are culpable.

384
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,980
You, your children,
you could lose everything you own.

385
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,107
Do you understand?

386
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:02,279
All courtesy of this criminal
you refuse to divorce.

387
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:07,326
- I didn't marry a criminal.
- Well, you're married to one now.

388
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,199
How about we run through this
one more time...

389
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,161
...especially where I do the talking,
you don't say jack?

390
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,247
Oh, I'm gonna say jack.
I'm gonna say plenty.

391
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:38,709
What did we say about escalating,
huh? Who's got your back here?

392
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,420
Me, all right?
I'm going to take care of things.

393
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,923
Hey, what are the parameters
of this sobriety thing you got going?

394
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,092
- What do you mean?
- Can you take a Xanax?

395
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,428
Because I got a drawer full of them.

396
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,765
I get them from my "chiropractor."

397
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:57,853
Vietnamese, 5-foot tall.
She adjusts you to "completion."

398
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,731
Her name's Kim Nu Suong...

399
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,902
...as delicious as it sounds.

400
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,446
I should give you her card.

401
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,032
Hell with this. I'm out of here.

402
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,950
He's here.

403
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,412
Send him in.

404
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,711
Hello, Walt. Good to see you.

405
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,757
Please, have a seat here.

406
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,468
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

407
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,888
You're late.

408
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:36,100
Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here now.

409
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,769
There's always a way
to oil everyone's lock.

410
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,815
This young man is prepared
to offer you a sweetheart of a deal...

411
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,318
- ...for doing precisely nothing.
- Really?

412
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:51,281
Ten percent of all future profits
from his solo venture.

413
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,494
That's money you get paid
for walking down to the mailbox.

414
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,331
Consider it a gesture of respect
for your valuable contribution...

415
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:03,335
...to the business thus far.
I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.

416
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,588
That's charity, is what that is.

417
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,298
I do all the work.

418
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,301
He sits around on his fat ass
judging people.

419
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:15,139
Escalating. Stop.

420
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,934
So there's that,
but then there's one small detail.

421
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,354
Clearly a mistake was made
on the part of our mutual associate...

422
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,149
...when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

423
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,902
He must not have realized that you
two had come to a parting of the ways.

424
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,822
Take it. It belongs to you.

425
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,158
You're damn right it belongs to me.

426
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,703
I knew I could count on you boys
to play nice. That's...

427
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:40,289
- That almost brings a tear to my eye.
- Enjoy it.

428
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,791
Spend it in good health.

429
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:47,588
That is the last money
you'll ever earn in this business.

430
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,382
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

431
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:57,514
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse,
but our mutual associate...

432
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:01,727
...was only using you to get to me.

433
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,228
What are you talking about?

434
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:07,858
See, he needs someone
with expertise...

435
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,736
...someone who knows
what he's doing.

436
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:14,531
In other words, he needs me.

437
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,242
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

438
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:20,996
Yeah.
Let's see, how should I put this?

439
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,249
I'm in.

440
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,169
You're out.

441
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,925
Walt, hold on there.

442
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,929
What was the offer, if I may ask?

443
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,351
It's 3 million
for three months of my time.

444
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,562
You're gonna need that money
laundered. I mean, of course.

445
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,064
What was our deal before?

446
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,358
Seventeen percent.
That's a shade high.

447
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,861
Let's settle on an even 15.
That's a nice round number.

448
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,071
Five percent.

449
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,864
- Fourteen's fair.
- Five.

450
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,074
- Thirteen.
- Five.

451
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,285
- Twelve. For old times' sake, 12.
- Five.

452
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,038
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

453
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,625
Ten even, but I can't go any lower
and still respect myself.

454
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:07,876
Five.

455
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:11,964
What in the hell just happened?
You're my lawyer, not his.

456
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,592
That's the way of the world, kid.
Go with the winner.

457
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,053
You think this will stop me
from cooking?

458
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,763
Cook whatever you like.

459
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,892
As long as it's that ridiculous
Chili P or some other dreck...

460
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,271
...but don't even think
about using my formula.

461
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,607
Just try and stop me, bitch.

462
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,702
- Yes?
- Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?

463
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,871
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

464
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,790
I'm with the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

465
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,461
We're interested in an RV that's
registered to your name and address.

466
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,381
- Do you have an RV?
- I did.

467
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,383
It was stolen months ago.

468
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,386
Stolen, huh? Yeah.

469
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,390
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

470
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,518
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police or the DMV.

471
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,480
I just didn't get around to it.

472
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,565
May I ask why?

473
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,569
I mean, it's a great way
to get the family together...

474
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,237
...for an affordable vacation.

475
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,531
It must've been a blow
when it went missing.

476
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,325
It was.

477
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,704
Do you have any ideas at all
who might've taken it?

478
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,542
I didn't want him arrested.

479
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:17,172
He ran with a bad crowd,
but he was never a bad person.

480
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,800
I thought he could turn
his life around.

481
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,760
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

482
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,012
My son.

483
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,224
I'd really like to speak with him.

484
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:32,270
He's passed away.
He was shot two months ago.

485
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,274
- What was your son's name?
- Christian.

486
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,902
Christian Ortega.

487
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,115
Was his nickname Combo?

488
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,584
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.
