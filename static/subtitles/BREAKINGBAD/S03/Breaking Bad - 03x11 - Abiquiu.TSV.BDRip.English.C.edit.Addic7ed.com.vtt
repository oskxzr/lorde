00:10.594 --> 00:15.265
Yo, I thought I was gonna see
some, like, vaginas.

00:18.644 --> 00:22.439
I didn't say
she actually painted vaginas.

00:22.731 --> 00:29.279
I said, some of her paintings
looked like vaginas.

00:30.322 --> 00:33.784
Seriously? Not even close.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.872
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.584
Everyday items, her surroundings.

00:42.793 --> 00:48.215
Some of it evoked an erotic nature.

00:48.841 --> 00:51.218
It's who she was.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.472
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.599
This chick have medical issues?

00:58.809 --> 01:01.019
This particular painting...

01:01.562 --> 01:03.105
...is of a door.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.985
Any other doors we can check out?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.988
Like, real ones or...?

01:13.156 --> 01:15.534
You know, I don't get it.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.662
Why would anyone
paint a picture of a door...

01:18.871 --> 01:22.165
...over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

01:22.374 --> 01:25.919
- But it wasn't the same.
- Yeah, it was.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.797
It was the same subject,
but different every time.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.550
The light was different,
her mood was different.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.303
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.472
And that's not psycho to you?

01:37.681 --> 01:40.767
Well, then why should we do anything
more than once?

01:41.018 --> 01:43.478
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

01:43.687 --> 01:47.232
Maybe we should only have sex once,
if it's the same thing.

01:47.441 --> 01:51.153
- Whoa, no.
- Should we just watch one sunset?

01:51.904 --> 01:54.448
Or live just one day?

01:54.948 --> 01:58.243
It's new every time.
Each time is a different experience.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.829
Okay, fine.

02:01.038 --> 02:06.710
I guess the cow skull pictures
were cool, but a door?

02:07.920 --> 02:11.757
I will say it again. A door.

02:12.883 --> 02:16.303
Why not a door? Sometimes
you get fixated on something...

02:16.470 --> 02:18.764
...and you might not even get why.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.475
You open yourself up
and go with the flow...

02:21.683 --> 02:24.269
...wherever the universe takes you.

02:24.478 --> 02:29.149
Okay, so the universe
took her to a door.

02:29.358 --> 02:34.238
And she got all obsessed with it
and just had to paint it 20 times...

02:34.446 --> 02:36.156
...until it was perfect.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.575
I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.995
Yeah? Well...

02:42.913 --> 02:44.540
...I mean...

02:44.915 --> 02:47.167
...some things.

03:01.807 --> 03:05.102
That was so sweet,
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit.

03:06.562 --> 03:09.147
You can't admit, just for once,
that I'm right.

03:09.356 --> 03:13.694
Come on. That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over...

03:13.902 --> 03:17.114
...until that stupid door was perfect.

03:17.322 --> 03:21.326
No. That door was her home
and she loved it.

03:21.994 --> 03:25.455
To me,
that's about making that feeling last.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.784
All right, here we go. You ready?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.957
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.466
Nope. Nope, that's it. Take me up.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.092
You can do this, Hank.

04:19.301 --> 04:23.722
Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.891
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.186
- If you can get your leg up, go for it.
- Take me up.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.731
Coffee break. We're gonna let you rest
and then try again.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.777
Never mind about your coffee break.
Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.324
- We'll just pick up where we left off.
- Come on, Hank.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.619
You can do it. How else
are you gonna get out of here?

04:45.827 --> 04:49.289
Don't you have any friends?
I mean, Jesus, find something to do.

04:49.498 --> 04:53.502
I don't need everyone staring at me
hanging here like a camel's ball sack.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.255
Hank, he just wants to be supportive.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.382
It's all right.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.222
I'll be right back, okay?
Be right back.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.309
Gonna get me out of here
sometime today?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.146
Sky?

05:16.650 --> 05:20.737
We got our first bill,
and, you know, if you're still insistent...

05:20.946 --> 05:22.698
I am.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.206
Prepare yourself.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.883
They're gonna start coming in weekly
like that, so...

05:42.217 --> 05:45.095
You're sure you can do this?

05:47.472 --> 05:49.057
Yeah.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.304
I'll do that.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.643
What the hell, man?

06:33.519 --> 06:35.896
What, I can't work a scale now?

06:36.855 --> 06:40.108
This is bullshit. Just say it.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.693
Just say the words.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.154
You think I'm stealing.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.547
Walk with who you are.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.758
That was the phrase my sponsor
used to use with me...

07:04.967 --> 07:07.636
...back when I first started
coming to meetings.

07:07.803 --> 07:11.682
It's probably just a different way
of saying be yourself, right?

07:12.891 --> 07:17.521
But this idea of "walk" also tells me...

07:18.105 --> 07:21.817
...that I have to move forward.
Always good advice, at least for me.

07:22.693 --> 07:26.738
I see we have some new people here
at Group, a couple new faces.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.784
See some hands? First time?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.210
Great. Welcome.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.880
Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.174
Say whatever's on your mind.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.093
How about you?
You wanna start us off?

07:50.429 --> 07:54.474
Yeah. My name is Andrea...

07:59.188 --> 08:01.940
We don't bite. No judgments.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.360
You can be as open and honest
as you wanna be.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.699
Honestly? I don't wanna be here.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.581
All right, fair enough.
Who else had their hand up?

08:23.504 --> 08:25.088
Hey, what's up?

08:25.464 --> 08:27.424
My name's Jesse.

08:27.799 --> 08:31.720
Well, hello. My name's Brandon.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.973
And this is, I believe, Peter?

08:35.182 --> 08:38.018
Right, I'm Peter. How are you?

08:46.568 --> 08:49.446
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.074
It's gonna get slower
smuggling product...

08:52.282 --> 08:54.826
...with Grandpa Anus
watching every move I make.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.955
But don't worry, I'll keep it flowing.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.499
- Great, right on.
- Yeah.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.877
So how's it selling?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.546
Mad volume?

09:06.004 --> 09:08.340
Yeah, it's...

09:08.924 --> 09:10.968
You know, it's...

09:12.344 --> 09:13.554
It's not so good.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.307
What do you mean?
How much have you sold?

09:18.392 --> 09:19.768
I sold a teenth.

09:19.977 --> 09:24.231
- One teenth? That's it?
- Yeah.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.524
To who?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.943
To him.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.866
It's not easy selling to these people.
They're trying to better themselves.

09:34.032 --> 09:37.536
Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff
going on here.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.164
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two,

09:41.331 --> 09:44.126
and you're too pussy to sell?

09:45.002 --> 09:47.087
You're pathetic.

09:47.963 --> 09:50.674
You know what? I want it back.
All of it.

09:50.841 --> 09:54.219
- I'll sell it myself.
- Come on, man. Don't be like that.

09:54.428 --> 09:58.015
Selling to these people,
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.434
It's not so easy like you think.

10:00.642 --> 10:05.564
I will show you
exactly how easy it is.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.028
- Thank you.
- All right.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.113
See you next week.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.752
- Oh, hey, sorry.
- No, go ahead.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.379
Andrea, right?

10:30.088 --> 10:33.091
- Yeah.
- Hey, my name's Jesse...

10:33.800 --> 10:38.222
...and I don't really
wanna be here... either.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.102
Sorry.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.002
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

11:09.294 --> 11:10.921
No.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.465
Your dad is.

11:18.262 --> 11:20.973
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.225
Are you that boring?

11:23.725 --> 11:26.061
I'm comforting.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.815
I'm a comforting presence.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.827
Hey, so check it out.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.204
See what that means?

11:44.413 --> 11:45.414
Check out the date.

11:46.456 --> 11:51.128
Next Thursday is officially six months
that I've had my learner's.

11:51.420 --> 11:57.384
Which means I can get my provisional
and start driving by myself.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.054
You don't turn 16
for two more months.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.682
It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.810
Look it up. They changed the law
like, 10 years ago.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.896
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.

12:09.104 --> 12:12.316
Doesn't matter if you voted for it,
it's the law.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.695
So both of you start thinking about
what kind of car you wanna buy me.

12:16.904 --> 12:21.575
I think I'd be good
with either an old IROC or a 'Stang.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.120
A 'Stang.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.582
How about something
with playing cards in the spokes?

12:28.790 --> 12:31.877
Makes a nice motory sound,
you know?

12:34.171 --> 12:37.090
Dad, you're not gonna
get off that easy.

12:37.716 --> 12:41.261
Well, I think that this is...

12:41.470 --> 12:44.932
We should probably
table this discussion for later.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.727
Your dad and I have a couple things
we need to talk about, so...

12:48.936 --> 12:50.646
Okay.

12:51.855 --> 12:55.192
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback...

12:55.400 --> 12:59.947
...in Grabber Lime
with a shaker hood.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.490
'Stang.

13:01.698 --> 13:07.037
I'll write that down so we don't forget.
Oh, darn it, no pencil.

13:31.603 --> 13:35.232
What is
"Ice Station Zebra Associates"?

13:36.775 --> 13:40.195
It's a loan out, it's fine.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.364
Whose loan out?

13:42.573 --> 13:45.242
It's fine. Really.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.911
I...

13:48.620 --> 13:49.663
...have a guy.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.541
Okay.

13:52.916 --> 13:56.753
Does your guy know the tax code
and regulations in New Mexico?

13:56.962 --> 14:01.049
There's very specific paperwork that
has to be submitted quarterly on this.

14:01.258 --> 14:04.011
Yes. My guy is a top...

14:04.344 --> 14:05.888
- ...guy.
- Who is he?

14:06.263 --> 14:08.640
What's his name?
What are his qualifications?

14:08.849 --> 14:14.229
Walt, this money
has to be unimpeachable...

14:14.438 --> 14:16.899
...when it reaches Hank and Marie.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.484
And it is. It will be.

14:19.693 --> 14:23.864
But how do I know that? I mean,
you can't even tell me the man's name.

14:24.072 --> 14:27.326
Jesus, Skyler,
do you really wanna know?

14:27.659 --> 14:29.077
Do you really wanna know?

14:33.123 --> 14:34.833
Really?

15:09.368 --> 15:11.203
What a pleasure it is to have you.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.748
I'm gonna call you Skyler,
if that's okay. It's a lovely name.

15:14.957 --> 15:18.293
Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.

15:18.502 --> 15:23.131
Walt never told me how lucky he was...
Prior to recent unfortunate... events.

15:23.340 --> 15:26.385
His taste in women
is the same as his taste in lawyers...

15:26.593 --> 15:30.180
...only the very best
with just the right amount of dirty.

15:32.683 --> 15:36.144
That's a joke. That's a joke.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.939
It funny because you are so clearly
very classy.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.692
Here, please, sit down.

15:41.900 --> 15:47.239
So Walt tells me that you have
some concerns I can alleviate.

15:47.406 --> 15:49.658
Yes, I do. I have...

15:50.534 --> 15:52.619
...concerns.

15:53.245 --> 15:55.289
If we're going to go down this road...

15:55.497 --> 15:58.542
...and clearly we are
for the sake of my brother-in-law...

15:59.334 --> 16:02.838
I've heard about him.
He's an American hero.

16:04.256 --> 16:08.177
At any rate, I need some assurances
that we're gonna go about this...

16:08.385 --> 16:11.847
...in a manner that is extremely safe
and cautious.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.975
Fair enough.
I'll walk you through the process.

16:15.184 --> 16:19.479
First step is something we like to call
money laundering, all right?

16:19.688 --> 16:23.609
Take your money, represented by,
say, these jelly beans...

16:23.817 --> 16:26.320
You know, I'm a bookkeeper,
so I actually...

16:26.528 --> 16:28.697
I know what money laundering is.

16:29.865 --> 16:32.409
- Well.
- Yeah.

16:32.618 --> 16:36.455
And as with most things,
the devil is in the details.

16:36.663 --> 16:41.043
So to begin with, what are we saying
is the source of this money?

16:41.251 --> 16:42.794
That's simple.

16:43.003 --> 16:47.216
Walt here, actually came up with
a great story about gambling winnings.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.801
Blackjack, right?
Some card-counting system?

16:50.010 --> 16:52.387
Well, actually that was Skyler's idea.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.559
Well, you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

16:58.227 --> 16:59.228
There you have it.

16:59.436 --> 17:03.607
I'll generate false Currency Transaction
Reports out the wazoo...

17:03.815 --> 17:08.320
...as well as the necessary W-2Gs.
I know a couple casino managers...

17:08.529 --> 17:11.490
...who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.200
It's a win-win for everyone.

17:13.534 --> 17:16.036
Yeah, but you can't sell that
for very long...

17:16.245 --> 17:18.789
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.667
We declare just enough
not to arouse suspicion...

17:21.834 --> 17:26.672
...then Walt's onetime winnings
become seed money for an investment.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.715
Investment in what?

17:28.924 --> 17:30.717
Drum roll, please. Wait for it.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.011
Laser tag.

17:34.930 --> 17:38.058
Laser tag. Seven thousand square feet
of rollicking fun...

17:38.267 --> 17:40.727
...in the heart
of northern Bernalillo County.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.772
Laser tag?

17:44.314 --> 17:48.110
Yeah, there's guns and glow lights,
and kids wear the vests...

17:48.318 --> 17:51.154
Yeah, no, no. I actually...
I know what it is.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.408
It's just that in relation to Walt, it's...

17:54.575 --> 17:57.619
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.373
Makes more sense
than you two being together.

18:01.582 --> 18:05.794
Do you even know Walt?
I mean, how would he, of all people...

18:06.003 --> 18:09.715
...buy a laser tag business?
It doesn't add up.

18:09.923 --> 18:14.136
It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist,
scientists love lasers.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.555
Plus, they got bumper boats, so...

18:16.722 --> 18:18.098
"Hey, everybody...

18:18.307 --> 18:23.228
...Walt suddenly decided to invest
in laser tag. Just out of the blue".

18:23.437 --> 18:27.983
Really? That's what we're supposed
to tell people, our family, our friends...

18:28.192 --> 18:29.568
...the government?

18:29.776 --> 18:33.572
Let me bottom line this for you.
You don't need to be involved, okay?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.116
I've been doing this
for a lot of years...

18:36.283 --> 18:39.203
...successfully, believe it or not,
without your help.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.541
So thank you for stopping by.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.436
You want a beer or something?

19:05.229 --> 19:07.147
Or something?

19:07.314 --> 19:09.107
What do you mean?

19:09.983 --> 19:12.361
Like, beer.

19:12.528 --> 19:15.113
I'm cleaned out of anything else.

19:17.324 --> 19:21.119
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.288
Yeah.

19:23.872 --> 19:30.212
I've heard it over and over
and over again.

19:32.256 --> 19:34.716
You know,
don't you think it's ridiculous...

19:34.925 --> 19:38.595
...that society says beer is okay...

19:38.804 --> 19:43.475
...and a little hit of something sweet
is wrong?

19:43.684 --> 19:48.939
I mean, what's the point
of shutting yourself off completely...

19:49.147 --> 19:52.818
...from something
that lifts you off the ground?

19:55.529 --> 20:02.786
I spend so much energy
fighting the urge not to use...

20:02.995 --> 20:06.415
...and I feel like crap because of it.

20:09.543 --> 20:13.755
- I know, it's just...
- What?

20:15.340 --> 20:19.178
I can't get caught using again.

20:22.973 --> 20:25.267
See, the thing is...

20:26.977 --> 20:29.938
...not to get caught.

20:32.232 --> 20:35.485
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

20:37.905 --> 20:41.783
Just a little gas in the tank...

20:41.950 --> 20:47.039
...and suddenly
everything is interesting.

20:49.041 --> 20:52.503
Man, I wish
I could make that feeling last.

20:56.548 --> 21:00.177
Like I said, I got nothing here.

21:02.387 --> 21:06.141
What if I could get some?

21:12.689 --> 21:15.317
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Hey, baby.

21:16.193 --> 21:18.529
Your nana brought you home... early.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.450
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today?

21:23.659 --> 21:26.662
I was, then I saw your car.

21:27.246 --> 21:30.874
- I thought you had a meeting.
- I did, but we changed the time.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.211
Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.

21:34.419 --> 21:38.465
He's like a sponsor.
Jesse, this is Grandma.

21:54.106 --> 21:57.276
Jesse, this is Brock.

21:58.443 --> 22:02.447
So you have a kid, huh?

22:02.656 --> 22:04.116
What's up?

22:04.741 --> 22:06.577
Brock, huh?

22:07.077 --> 22:09.288
That's a cool name.

22:10.289 --> 22:13.083
Here, give it up.

22:23.343 --> 22:27.598
Brock is almost 6.
You okay, with kids?

22:27.764 --> 22:30.726
What? Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.

22:32.394 --> 22:36.023
Okay, Brock is gonna go play
in his room while the big people talk.

22:36.231 --> 22:39.234
He's gonna go play with his Legos
and his cars.

22:39.443 --> 22:41.320
- Say, "Bye, Jesse".
- Bye, Jesse.

22:42.905 --> 22:44.990
Hope you had a good time
at Grandma's.

22:45.199 --> 22:47.492
Oh, I fixed your blue car,
do you remember?

22:47.701 --> 22:48.827
The convertible one?

22:49.036 --> 22:52.706
You can jump on your bed.
Play with your toys.

22:52.915 --> 22:57.836
Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking,
and that man...

22:58.504 --> 22:59.546
...is neither.

22:59.755 --> 23:03.884
I'll admit
he comes across like a circus clown...

23:04.176 --> 23:05.969
...but he knows what he's doing.

23:06.178 --> 23:09.640
And safe and cautious
is you not being involved in this at all.

23:09.848 --> 23:11.850
Well, it's a little late on that.

23:12.059 --> 23:15.938
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.611
Skyler...

23:23.362 --> 23:26.615
...this isn't just about
what happened before.

23:28.742 --> 23:33.580
My involvement in this is ongoing.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.542
Understand?

23:38.168 --> 23:39.586
I can't just quit.

23:41.672 --> 23:45.133
I have something of a contract.

23:45.342 --> 23:48.303
But it's all very safe, professional.

23:48.846 --> 23:50.514
Structured.

23:50.931 --> 23:53.433
Like, I can't simply quit.

24:03.068 --> 24:04.194
Where you going?

24:19.960 --> 24:22.671
If you're gonna launder money,
Walt...

24:23.213 --> 24:25.716
...at least do it right.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.361
You worked here four years.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.655
It's a business you understand.

24:48.864 --> 24:51.074
It's a story people will believe.

24:51.283 --> 24:53.577
Not laser tag, this.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.872
This is what we buy.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.166
You.

25:00.209 --> 25:02.503
This is what you buy.

25:24.024 --> 25:28.904
Yeah, I mean, there's free donuts.
Nothing's wrong with a free donut.

25:32.616 --> 25:36.745
Hey, Jesse, right?

25:36.954 --> 25:39.873
Brandon, Peter.
How goes it? Hanging in there?

25:40.082 --> 25:42.084
Can we please, just...?

25:42.292 --> 25:43.377
Dumb-ass.

25:44.294 --> 25:47.089
Sorry, man.
I was trying to keep it on the DL.

25:47.297 --> 25:51.343
So you and that girl, do the deed yet?

25:51.844 --> 25:53.303
Do what?

25:53.512 --> 25:57.015
You know, sell to her?

25:58.725 --> 26:00.686
What are you two even doing here?

26:02.688 --> 26:03.689
What do you mean?

26:04.565 --> 26:08.318
You can't get your nut up to sell,
what's the point of even coming?

26:08.527 --> 26:11.196
Homey, I'm on, like, step five.

26:11.363 --> 26:13.574
Deuce, yo. I'm catching up.

26:19.872 --> 26:22.791
Whatever. Later.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.046
Hey.

26:28.255 --> 26:30.924
Dude needs to come into the fold.

26:31.592 --> 26:33.093
Yup.

26:36.138 --> 26:39.558
Hey, you know what?
I have magical powers.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.268
You wanna see?

26:43.270 --> 26:45.022
Ready?

26:47.900 --> 26:49.526
That's not real.

26:49.735 --> 26:52.696
It is real. All right,
do you wanna see something real?

26:52.905 --> 26:54.489
Look at this. Watch this.

26:55.991 --> 26:56.992
Ready?

27:03.332 --> 27:05.000
You like that?

27:05.584 --> 27:09.004
That's science and stuff,
makes it do that.

27:09.630 --> 27:12.216
- Do it again.
- Let Jesse... eat his dinner, Brock.

27:12.424 --> 27:15.219
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
Wanna see it again?

27:15.427 --> 27:17.971
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

27:18.555 --> 27:20.432
Firecrackers?

27:20.641 --> 27:24.311
You know,
I don't have any firecrackers on me.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.773
- Who does tricks with firecrackers?
- Tomas.

27:27.981 --> 27:32.236
Tomas does tricks with firecrackers,
huh? Who's Tomas?

27:32.444 --> 27:35.030
- He's my kid brother.
- Yeah?

27:35.239 --> 27:36.907
And we don't talk about him.

27:38.325 --> 27:40.786
Come on, eat your food, Brock.

27:43.622 --> 27:46.166
Can I have a chip?
I'm gonna steal your chip.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.085
Hey, that's mine.

27:50.295 --> 27:52.339
That's it?
That's what you wanna buy?

27:52.548 --> 27:55.300
People will believe it, at least.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.594
I worked here for four years.

27:57.803 --> 28:00.097
"Wax on, wax off," was that you?

28:00.848 --> 28:03.517
Hey, how come you guys
always give air freshener?

28:03.684 --> 28:05.811
I explicitly say, "No air freshener<i>"...</i>

28:06.019 --> 28:10.107
...and every time, I drive away
smelling like an Alpine whorehouse.

28:10.941 --> 28:14.611
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

28:14.820 --> 28:17.948
It makes a better story
than your laser tag.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.576
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?

28:21.451 --> 28:25.539
She has a point. It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

28:25.747 --> 28:29.626
Based on her years of experience
in money laundering, I suppose.

28:29.835 --> 28:33.422
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.425
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner...

28:36.633 --> 28:39.803
...and it worked because I believed it,
all right?

28:40.012 --> 28:42.139
Has nothing to do with the story.

28:42.723 --> 28:46.393
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work
because it doesn't have a Danny.

28:46.602 --> 28:47.853
There's no Danny here.

28:49.605 --> 28:51.982
What in God's name is a Danny?

28:52.191 --> 28:56.320
Danny runs the laser tag.
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

28:56.528 --> 29:01.116
Where others saw a dirt lot,
he saw black lights, rubber aliens...

29:01.325 --> 29:03.994
...teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

29:04.161 --> 29:05.913
Like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.

29:06.121 --> 29:09.541
When the stock market took a shit
and Danny got into trouble...

29:09.750 --> 29:13.545
...he went searching for exactly
the type of situation we're offering.

29:13.754 --> 29:17.716
Danny will look the other way
to keep his dream afloat.

29:17.925 --> 29:21.762
In other words,
Danny can be trusted completely.

29:22.304 --> 29:27.518
That guy, the guy with the... eyebrows
that won't quit, is he a Danny?

29:28.101 --> 29:32.105
You buy this place, all you got
is a big building that squirts water.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.609
You got no Danny here.

29:46.995 --> 29:49.164
You wanna stay for dinner?

29:49.498 --> 29:50.958
Yeah.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.043
Thanks.

29:53.627 --> 29:55.546
What time is it?

29:57.172 --> 29:59.132
Early still.

30:02.553 --> 30:04.263
So...

30:06.640 --> 30:08.517
What?

30:09.560 --> 30:15.023
Thought maybe if you're holding,
we can do something.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.026
What?

30:18.360 --> 30:22.155
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about.

30:22.447 --> 30:25.200
- Maybe you had a line on some?
- Wait.

30:27.494 --> 30:29.162
What?

30:29.830 --> 30:32.124
Thought you said
the kid is coming home.

30:32.374 --> 30:35.294
Yeah, in a few hours.

30:35.544 --> 30:37.713
And you seriously wanna get high?

30:38.547 --> 30:41.008
I don't know what
you're getting pissed about.

30:41.216 --> 30:43.468
You're the one who brought it up.

30:43.677 --> 30:47.347
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

30:47.890 --> 30:49.474
What kind of mother are you?

30:49.683 --> 30:51.018
What?

30:51.226 --> 30:55.105
You heard me. What kind of mom
gets wasted with a kid to take care of?

30:59.318 --> 31:02.654
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

31:02.863 --> 31:04.781
You come in my house
and judge me?

31:04.990 --> 31:08.202
Like you got no responsibilities
so it's okay for you?

31:08.410 --> 31:09.786
What do you know about me?

31:09.995 --> 31:12.664
I take care of my baby.
I'll do anything for him.

31:12.831 --> 31:16.126
The day Brock was born, I swore...

31:16.627 --> 31:20.214
...I won't let what happened to Tomas,
happen to my son.

31:21.882 --> 31:24.009
I'll die first.

31:24.676 --> 31:26.970
Sorry. I...

31:27.763 --> 31:29.640
I just...

31:33.685 --> 31:37.147
Look, I'll get out of here if you want.

31:37.397 --> 31:39.233
That's what you wanna do, then go.

31:39.441 --> 31:41.151
It's not what I want.

31:41.360 --> 31:45.531
Look, I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

31:57.251 --> 31:59.169
We both were.

32:01.588 --> 32:03.298
You're right...

32:03.632 --> 32:06.760
...I don't know
what you've been through.

32:07.052 --> 32:09.263
You can tell me if you want.

32:13.433 --> 32:16.186
This whole neighborhood’s
run by gangs.

32:16.812 --> 32:20.524
They run the drugs,
control the streets.

32:22.901 --> 32:26.154
They sort of took Tomas in.

32:27.698 --> 32:28.824
No dad around.

32:30.158 --> 32:32.160
Eight years old...

32:32.953 --> 32:35.205
...they got Tomas slinging.

32:35.873 --> 32:37.958
Part of some crew.

32:39.751 --> 32:42.504
Then when he was 10...

32:43.172 --> 32:46.925
...for some initiation or something...

32:48.844 --> 32:50.512
...they made him kill somebody.

32:53.515 --> 32:57.686
I heard the rumors.
I didn't believe it at first.

32:59.980 --> 33:02.482
But then I saw him like a week later.

33:05.944 --> 33:09.364
And he told me, yeah, he did it.

33:11.283 --> 33:13.452
They gave Tomas a gun.

33:14.369 --> 33:16.413
Gave him a choice.

33:16.914 --> 33:19.499
Him or some dude.

33:20.918 --> 33:22.794
So he did it.

33:24.505 --> 33:27.257
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

33:28.509 --> 33:30.928
Who did he say he killed?

33:31.929 --> 33:33.847
Some dealer.

33:36.308 --> 33:38.227
From some outside crew.

33:38.685 --> 33:43.148
Right around the corner from here,
over off of Central.

33:45.734 --> 33:49.238
Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

33:52.991 --> 33:55.035
Off of Central?

33:56.495 --> 33:59.289
Like over by the train tracks?

34:01.291 --> 34:03.252
When was this?

34:04.503 --> 34:06.713
Few months back.

34:10.926 --> 34:13.095
What else did he tell you?

34:18.058 --> 34:20.811
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

34:21.937 --> 34:23.981
Shot him dead.

34:27.150 --> 34:30.320
Just because he was working
the wrong corner.

34:36.034 --> 34:38.203
It won't happen again.

34:39.329 --> 34:41.123
Not to my son.

34:58.807 --> 35:00.601
Guess what.

35:02.269 --> 35:06.190
People who say "guess what" and
then actually expect you to guess...

35:06.398 --> 35:08.192
...I hate those people.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.027
Well, I just heard...

35:10.235 --> 35:14.948
...about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank...

35:15.157 --> 35:18.535
...who is going to be released
at the... end of this week.

35:18.994 --> 35:21.538
Isn't that fantastic?

35:22.789 --> 35:25.083
They plan on rolling me
out the front door?

35:25.292 --> 35:28.462
Or put me on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

35:28.670 --> 35:30.255
Hey.

35:30.756 --> 35:34.510
I don't care what any damned
insurance company thinks.

35:34.718 --> 35:38.805
- I'm not leaving here till I'm well.
- Hank, this isn't about insurance.

35:39.014 --> 35:43.435
I've talked to everybody, they all say
you are healthy enough to go home.

35:43.644 --> 35:47.356
- I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.
- Hank, you get stronger every day.

35:47.564 --> 35:49.566
You don't need to be in a hospital.

35:49.733 --> 35:52.819
In this condition, yeah, I do.

35:53.028 --> 35:55.906
You'll be just as comfortable at home
as you are here.

35:56.114 --> 35:59.952
- You'll have all the same... equipment.
- Same... equipment? What's that mean?

36:00.118 --> 36:04.039
The... equipment that you have here,
that you need. Short-term.

36:04.248 --> 36:07.292
You'll do your PT at home
and it'll be great...

36:07.459 --> 36:10.254
...because you'll be home.

36:10.462 --> 36:13.799
Wait till you see the bedroom.
I had them move the plasma in.

36:14.007 --> 36:16.093
I know that's how
you always wanted it.

36:16.301 --> 36:18.887
You only had to get shot to get it,
right?

36:19.096 --> 36:22.432
- I got you a new bed...
- A hospital bed?

36:23.308 --> 36:24.393
Well...

36:24.601 --> 36:27.271
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

36:27.604 --> 36:29.231
Hank...

36:29.606 --> 36:30.983
...you'll be home.

36:31.692 --> 36:34.152
You get that out of my house.

36:34.403 --> 36:36.321
You hear me, Marie?

36:36.613 --> 36:37.906
Today.

36:39.241 --> 36:41.535
- Hank...
- I leave this hospital...

36:42.244 --> 36:45.539
...when I walk out of here.
You understand?

36:46.915 --> 36:49.293
And not before.

36:52.421 --> 36:53.922
What's a Danny?

36:54.131 --> 36:55.924
Danny's an accomplice.

36:56.133 --> 37:00.846
Someone who's in on the scheme,
who knows about laundering...

37:01.054 --> 37:03.473
...who's paid to look the other way.

37:04.933 --> 37:08.729
Now, while I agree with you
that laser tag is a hard sell...

37:08.937 --> 37:12.691
...without a Danny,
the car wash isn't really an option.

37:12.900 --> 37:17.112
And he can't get you another Danny
to run the car wash?

37:18.071 --> 37:19.990
Easier said than done.

37:20.199 --> 37:23.452
If we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

37:36.924 --> 37:38.008
What about me?

37:41.261 --> 37:42.846
What about you?

37:44.014 --> 37:45.474
Me.

37:47.142 --> 37:48.393
I'll be the Danny.

37:48.560 --> 37:52.022
No. No, no, Skyler,
that is not a good idea.

37:52.231 --> 37:54.483
I'm capable of managing
a small business.

37:54.691 --> 37:56.318
A legal business, not this.

37:56.527 --> 37:57.945
Who else could we trust?

37:58.153 --> 38:00.155
- No.
- Walt...

38:00.572 --> 38:02.032
...I'm in this.

38:02.241 --> 38:05.202
- And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
- No.

38:05.410 --> 38:09.373
- You are not in this. You are not...
- We're married, how am I not in this?

38:09.581 --> 38:12.042
We are not married, Skyler,
we're divorced.

38:21.260 --> 38:22.761
Right?

38:25.597 --> 38:30.936
I never actually got around
to filing the papers.

38:34.731 --> 38:39.236
Married couples can't be compelled
to testify against one another.

38:41.363 --> 38:43.657
So there's that.

39:08.223 --> 39:11.602
Jesse. Jesse.

39:12.644 --> 39:14.021
Respirator.

39:15.522 --> 39:17.232
Right.

39:38.045 --> 39:39.087
Yes?

39:46.970 --> 39:50.307
Yes, all right. Okay.

39:51.433 --> 39:53.352
Yeah, I'll be there.

39:55.896 --> 39:57.523
What was that?

39:59.441 --> 40:01.610
An invitation.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.173
Walter, you're right on time.

40:23.382 --> 40:25.509
Please, come in.

40:33.851 --> 40:36.478
I hope you like paila marina.

40:36.687 --> 40:39.356
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

40:40.941 --> 40:45.404
It sounds like a cliché, but indeed,
it's just like my mother used to make it.

40:49.908 --> 40:53.412
Come on. You can help me cook.

40:55.038 --> 41:00.586
This is a Chilean dish that I love...

41:00.794 --> 41:03.255
...but I never get to make it.

41:04.006 --> 41:05.591
Kids won't eat it.

41:06.425 --> 41:08.343
But...

41:08.886 --> 41:10.929
...you know how that is.

41:12.222 --> 41:13.765
Sure.

41:17.644 --> 41:19.062
Do you mind?

41:19.938 --> 41:22.774
Would you slice the garlic?

41:24.651 --> 41:26.570
Very thin.

41:34.328 --> 41:36.914
Why did you invite me here?

41:38.540 --> 41:40.459
We're working together...

41:40.626 --> 41:42.961
...why not break bread together?

41:44.880 --> 41:47.466
Now, the garlic?

42:04.691 --> 42:08.487
It always amazes me the way the
senses work in connection to memory.

42:08.695 --> 42:11.990
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

42:12.199 --> 42:15.994
Taken separately, these ingredients
alone don't remind me of anything.

42:16.203 --> 42:18.330
I mean, not very much at all.

42:18.539 --> 42:23.919
But in this precise combination,
the smell of this meal...

42:24.127 --> 42:27.422
...instantly, it brings you back
to my childhood.

42:27.631 --> 42:28.882
How is that possible?

42:30.092 --> 42:32.511
Basically, it takes place
in the hippocampus.

42:34.680 --> 42:37.474
Neural connections are formed.

42:38.392 --> 42:43.230
The senses make the neurons
express signals...

42:43.438 --> 42:48.443
...that go right back to the same part
of the brain as before.

42:48.694 --> 42:50.904
Where memory is stored.

42:51.446 --> 42:56.660
It's something called
relational memory.

43:00.205 --> 43:02.291
Don't quote me on that, I'm...

43:02.666 --> 43:05.335
I'm rusty on my biology.

43:05.544 --> 43:07.796
That's very interesting.

43:10.799 --> 43:12.593
Walter...

43:12.801 --> 43:15.220
...I would like to help you, if I could.

43:17.264 --> 43:19.266
Help me how?

43:19.474 --> 43:22.978
Well, when I first started out,
I made a lot of mistakes.

43:24.438 --> 43:26.064
More than I care to admit.

43:27.107 --> 43:29.693
I wish I'd had someone
to advise me...

43:30.277 --> 43:33.614
...because this life of ours...

43:33.822 --> 43:36.617
...it can overwhelm.

43:40.746 --> 43:43.415
You are a wealthy man now.

43:44.416 --> 43:46.919
And one must learn to be rich.

43:47.127 --> 43:50.422
To be poor, anyone can manage.

43:53.217 --> 43:56.386
What advice do you have for me?

43:59.056 --> 44:01.767
Never make the same mistake twice.

44:43.725 --> 44:45.310
Hey.

44:46.186 --> 44:47.604
What's up?

44:48.438 --> 44:50.774
You...? You Tomas?

44:50.983 --> 44:52.818
I heard you were the man.

44:52.985 --> 44:54.778
Yeah, what you want?

44:58.156 --> 45:00.033
Crystal.

45:00.576 --> 45:02.286
You think you could hook me up?

45:03.912 --> 45:06.206
- Three hundred.
- For a teenth?

45:06.415 --> 45:08.542
Shit, come on, yo.

45:08.750 --> 45:10.878
Three hundred.

45:31.982 --> 45:34.193
Hey, what's up?

45:43.410 --> 45:45.412
Hey, yo.

46:05.933 --> 46:07.726
Bounce.
