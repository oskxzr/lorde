01:19.288 --> 01:21.956
Think you'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

01:22.791 --> 01:25.626
Yeah, whatever.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.631
Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need
to be another 20 feet from the door.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.801
So roll me further, bitch.

01:55.657 --> 01:56.699
What's coming?

01:56.867 --> 01:59.994
Male, Caucasian. Early 40s.
Multiple gunshot wounds.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.667
BP is 70. Seven-zero over palp.

02:06.835 --> 02:10.797
Pulse 140. One-four-zero.
Weak and thready at the brachial.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.382
No breath sounds on the right side,
belly is rigid.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.052
Appears pale and diaphoretic.
How many entry wounds?

02:16.261 --> 02:18.513
Four. Shoulder and hip,
through and through.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.350
Right lung in lower left quadrant,
no visible exit wounds.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.018
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.521
- What's his hemoglobin?
- Seven-point-three.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.191
Need two large-bore IVs,
six units O-neg.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.236
Type and cross for six more units,
chest x-ray and KUB.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.322
Notify the OR, we are on the way.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.201
OR 1 is clear. Let's put him in there.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.025
Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.239
Damn, brother, look at you.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.575
That's messed up.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.244
How are you feeling? You okay?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.246
Actually...

03:27.124 --> 03:29.250
...I'm great.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.275
I don't understand.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.611
I thought things
were going pretty well.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.489
I thought we were kind of simpatico.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.368
You know?
We were becoming a real team.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.956
Not... Not so much, no.

04:09.291 --> 04:13.502
Is this about the temperature setting?
I can assure you that will not happen...

04:13.670 --> 04:15.504
No, it's bigger than that, Gale.

04:15.672 --> 04:19.467
It's much more than that.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.510
Could you elaborate?

04:21.678 --> 04:24.180
Well, yes, of course I could...

04:24.389 --> 04:28.017
...but I don't think either of us...

04:28.185 --> 04:31.020
...would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

04:33.398 --> 04:35.149
Yeah, so...

04:35.317 --> 04:36.484
Yeah.

04:36.652 --> 04:39.278
I set up the entire lab.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.822
You said you liked the configuration.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.699
And I do.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.993
For the most part.

04:46.495 --> 04:51.123
Look, you're a fine chemist, really,
with a promising future.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.460
It's just that I...

04:54.628 --> 05:01.676
That we just have different rhythms,
Gale.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.177
You see... It's...

05:04.012 --> 05:08.057
It's as if I'm classical...

05:08.225 --> 05:13.813
...but you are more jazz.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.566
- Jazz.
- Jazz. Yes.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.528
And God knows
there is nothing wrong with jazz.

05:20.946 --> 05:26.367
It's simply that I require...

05:26.535 --> 05:29.245
- Classical.
- Exactly.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.374
Oh, shit.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.544
Man, this is the bomb.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.761
What's up, partner?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.392
- I can't believe this.
- My replacement?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.602
Oh, Jesus.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.272
Hi. Gale.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.607
- Nice to meet you.
- What's up?

05:58.775 --> 06:01.360
Damn, we should've ditched that RV
months ago.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.071
It's all, like, shiny up in here.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.787
I'm sorry, I must be missing something.
I don't mean... I don't mean to be...

06:13.290 --> 06:14.957
- This...
- No.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.878
- Makes no sense.

06:25.093 --> 06:31.098
So I guess this is...

06:33.101 --> 06:36.937
Oh, dear mother of God.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.275
This is for the best.

06:42.152 --> 06:45.404
Two hundred pounds a week. Got it?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.448
Yeah.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.784
Oh, man.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.745
Mr. White.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.842
Okay, there's a lot to show you.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.303
Some new techniques to learn.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.932
- What, now?
- Yes, now.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.102
We've only got a couple days
before our next batch is due.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.978
And I need to get you up to speed.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.067
Right on. I'm just saying...

07:25.070 --> 07:27.154
How's the cell service down here?

07:27.322 --> 07:28.989
It's nonexistent.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.616
We're shielded.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.119
There's a hard line for emergencies.
Come on.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.496
So you haven't talked
to anybody today...

07:35.664 --> 07:38.290
...other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.584
Why?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.379
Your brother-in-law.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.840
What about him?

07:49.177 --> 07:51.345
- What's the story?
- He was unresponsive.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.681
You getting exposure
on those wounds?

07:53.849 --> 07:55.891
- Two units of normal saline.
- Bivalve mass.

07:56.101 --> 07:59.019
Breath sounds bilaterally.
Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.689
Other one's not much better.
Get those boots off.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.984
See if you get a pulse.
Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.235
Where's that blood?

08:06.987 --> 08:11.907
Dr. Bording to Cardiology.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.326
- Sir, can I help you?
- Yeah, I...

08:14.494 --> 08:16.996
- It's all right. He's family.
- Thank you.

08:17.664 --> 08:22.626
Marie. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, honey.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.008
I'm so sorry.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.760
I don't know what to say.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.853
- How is he?
- I don't know.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.898
They won't really tell us anything.
He's still in surgery.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.902
They shot him four times.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.863
Oh, Christ.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.745
- Where's Holly?
- I got a sitter.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.375
- Hey, how are you, huh?
- Fine.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.044
Yeah?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.255
Sure?

09:09.257 --> 09:12.593
I'm fine. I just need some fresh air.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.971
Okay.

09:16.181 --> 09:20.601
- Here. Let me get the door.
- I got it. I'm fine.

09:23.438 --> 09:28.943
Walt. Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.111
- Hello.
- I'm very sorry.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.613
Thank you.

09:32.781 --> 09:36.158
Can you tell us anything?
Any details?

09:36.326 --> 09:38.953
Right now, all we know
is two men ambushed Hank.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.122
They didn't have any ID on them.
Probably Mexican nationals.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.752
Their tattoos indicated an affiliation
with a drug cartel.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.131
Why did they attack Hank?

09:51.299 --> 09:52.800
We're not sure yet.

09:52.968 --> 09:56.971
It could be in relation to an
investigation Hank was working...

09:57.138 --> 10:01.642
...or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.437
They had an axe.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.858
The cartels tend to be dramatic.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.860
Jesus.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.825
- Where are they? I mean, did they...?
- Hank got both of them.

10:17.993 --> 10:21.662
He killed one outright, the other one's
upstairs in critical condition.

10:21.830 --> 10:25.541
Your brother-in-law's one tough
son of a bitch to take them both out...

10:25.750 --> 10:28.377
...considering
he didn't even have his gun.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.340
He didn't have his gun?

10:37.304 --> 10:40.639
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.517
Marie, the assault charge.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.520
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.648
That means
I had to take away his weapon.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.358
You had to take it.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.361
- It's standard procedure. No one...
- Okay. All right, listen.

10:54.529 --> 10:59.158
If you all listened to him from the start
and let him arrest that degenerate...

10:59.326 --> 11:01.869
...he wouldn't have taken things
into his own hands.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.705
And he would've had a gun
and could've defended himself.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.207
- Marie, let's just...
- No. Just...

11:09.377 --> 11:11.086
It's their fault.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.339
He didn't have a gun.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.549
Honey, this isn't helping you.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.384
You.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.554
What kind of partner are you?

11:22.015 --> 11:25.434
You were supposed to back him up,
and where were you?

11:25.602 --> 11:27.519
Where were you?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.563
Texas.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.691
And you.

11:32.859 --> 11:36.028
You're supposed
to protect your agents...

11:36.196 --> 11:38.238
...instead of taking their guns...

11:38.406 --> 11:41.241
...not supporting them,
not backing them up.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.910
- Marie. Marie.
- When they...

11:43.078 --> 11:47.706
Honey, let's just go and sit down,
okay?

11:48.249 --> 11:52.711
I'm not doing anything until these two
get the hell out of here. I mean it.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.094
- Sorry...
- Go.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.137
You are not welcome here.

12:02.347 --> 12:06.725
- The DEA is not welcome here.
- Okay, honey.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.060
Come on.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.604
Come on. Let's go sit down.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.244
It's not just them.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.289
It's you, Walt.

12:35.463 --> 12:40.134
This Pinkman
that Hank was looking for...

12:40.301 --> 12:43.262
...Hank would have never
even heard his name...

12:43.430 --> 12:47.141
...if you hadn't bought marijuana
from him.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.269
- Marie...
- Do you ever think about that, Walt?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.146
Do you?

12:52.480 --> 12:55.482
Do you think about everything
that you have put him through?

12:55.650 --> 12:57.693
Marie, stop.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.988
You're upset, and you're looking
for someone to blame...

13:01.156 --> 13:03.949
...and it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.618
It's not his fault.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.711
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.714
- Sweetheart...
- No. No. Don't...

13:22.719 --> 13:26.013
- It's okay.
- It's Hank.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.931
It's all right.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.034
All right, you're done.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.497
Okay, next.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.800
Hello.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.972
Hello, hello, hello.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.062
Yeah.

15:48.072 --> 15:53.076
Yo, yo, yo.
Jesse Pinkman in the house.

15:55.330 --> 16:00.500
Oh, my dear God.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.497
Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.250
Walter White,
please pick up a courtesy phone.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.889
Yo, we working sometime this year?

16:57.433 --> 17:00.727
What the hell are you thinking?
Why are you calling me here?

17:00.895 --> 17:03.522
Tried your cell
and it went straight to voicemail.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.191
- How am I to get a hold of you?
- You aren't.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.236
It's been a whole day.
How long is this grieving process?

17:09.404 --> 17:11.071
Just put a clock on it for me.

17:11.406 --> 17:14.116
All I'm saying
is we have a schedule, right?

17:14.283 --> 17:16.910
My family
comes before your schedule.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.079
Dude, it's not my schedule.

17:19.247 --> 17:23.667
- We have responsibilities here.
- I'll get there when I get there.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.796
You know what? Whatever.
I'll just cook on my own.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.757
- You will do no such thing.
- Why not?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.593
Well, for starters...

17:33.761 --> 17:36.763
...you aren't the least bit familiar
with any of the equipment.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.433
There's gotta be some sort of manual,
right?

17:39.767 --> 17:42.436
- And I can read.
- Jesse, touch nothing.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.813
Stop treating me
like I'm like your assistant.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.608
I'm not your bitch to order around.
We're partners. Remember?

17:48.776 --> 17:54.948
I need you to sit patiently and wait,
I will be there as soon as I can.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.284
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

17:57.452 --> 18:01.329
- We really do appreciate that.
- What, is your wife there?

18:01.497 --> 18:03.457
Yes. Yes, she is.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.251
She would be happy to know
you asked about her.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.086
Please do keep us in your thoughts.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.297
Hey, tell your douche bag
brother-in-law...

18:10.465 --> 18:12.507
...to head towards the light.

18:15.011 --> 18:19.014
So I'm thinking maybe we should go
get everybody some breakfast.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.976
Yeah, that sounds good.
Do you know who that was?

18:37.617 --> 18:42.996
You know,
these eggs are really not too bad.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.012
- Look at that.
- Look at what?

18:59.180 --> 19:02.349
At what? This. These spots.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.185
This fork is absolutely filthy.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.818
Tell me you see this.
You've got good eyes. Look at that.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.321
Marie, those are just water spots.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.531
That's fine.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.200
Those are not "water spots."

19:20.368 --> 19:22.369
It's dirt.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.872
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.709
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.170
God knows what.

19:32.338 --> 19:36.174
Seriously, Aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.386
Ours at home aren't any better.

19:39.554 --> 19:42.430
Yours at home are irrelevant.
We're in a hospital.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.767
They need to be a higher standard.
They have a responsibility.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.519
Well, I'm not actually sure...

19:47.687 --> 19:51.565
...if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies
as being part of the hospital.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.901
It's in the same building.
It's all under the same roof.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.611
Do you think that sick people...

19:56.821 --> 19:59.447
...aren't eating
with this bacteria-infested silverware?

19:59.615 --> 20:02.826
My God, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.372
Marie...

20:10.251 --> 20:11.835
I survived.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.881
I had my lobectomy at this hospital.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.716
Remember that?

20:18.593 --> 20:21.094
Remember how scared we all were?

20:22.388 --> 20:26.933
I didn't wanna act like it,
but I was terrified.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.395
All that week, all I could think of...

20:30.563 --> 20:35.150
...was how they were actually
going to cut me open...

20:35.359 --> 20:38.445
...and take out a part of me...

20:38.613 --> 20:41.781
...that was with me my entire life.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.242
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

20:46.287 --> 20:53.084
I think the scariest part
was when they took me into pre-op.

20:53.502 --> 20:58.423
Lying there,
waiting for them to anesthetize you.

20:58.799 --> 21:04.012
Knowing that you may never
wake up again.

21:10.186 --> 21:15.148
Actually what I really remember
about that day...

21:15.316 --> 21:17.817
...is driving to the hospital.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.820
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

21:21.489 --> 21:23.156
Yeah.

21:23.324 --> 21:27.160
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central...

21:27.328 --> 21:30.497
...and we hit every green light.

21:30.665 --> 21:35.835
I mean,
every single light that we hit... green.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.339
It's just... When does that happen?

21:40.841 --> 21:45.971
Just like, bang, bang,
green the entire way.

21:46.347 --> 21:50.308
And the whole time,
all I could think about was:

21:50.476 --> 21:55.855
"Why today? Why?
Why can't I just spend...

21:56.023 --> 21:59.150
...a few extra minutes in the car
with my family?"

22:01.696 --> 22:05.532
I never wanted to be stuck in traffic
so bad in my life.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.869
At least I was with my family.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.707
I had that.

22:18.379 --> 22:23.216
Anyway, I survived this place.

22:24.176 --> 22:27.387
And I'm not half the man
your husband is.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.541
Yes?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.918
What the hell is going on up there?

22:59.295 --> 23:01.129
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.797
You know about my men?

23:03.007 --> 23:06.634
I heard that they attacked a DEA agent.
Why would they do that?

23:06.802 --> 23:10.805
What's the matter?
Spanish not good enough anymore?

23:12.767 --> 23:15.977
I didn't order this, and my men
would never do this on their own.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.938
Someone gave the go-ahead.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.399
Are you accusing me?

23:21.942 --> 23:24.152
I'm just saying
they wouldn't act on their own.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.447
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.910
I assume that the next shipment
will be delayed.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.580
- Any thoughts on when it might arrive?
- A week, a month.

23:35.748 --> 23:39.793
There's too much focus on the border.
We lay low for the time being.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.128
We lay low,
and then we get the real story...

23:42.296 --> 23:43.797
...from my man who survived.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.800
Your man is in custody.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.134
God bless America!

23:48.302 --> 23:50.845
He's innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?

23:51.055 --> 23:52.806
I'll get him the best lawyer...

23:52.973 --> 23:54.974
...and then we'll learn the truth.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.811
Well, keep me apprised.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.942
Any time you got that close proximity
to the spine...

24:04.110 --> 24:06.444
...there's always gonna be cause
for concern...

24:06.612 --> 24:09.364
...but as I say,
it's really too soon to tell.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.158
He's out of surgery, at least, which is...

24:12.326 --> 24:15.662
- Out of surgery, on his way to recovery.
- All right. And where's that?

24:15.830 --> 24:17.831
Unfortunately, you can't see him yet.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.166
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.002
How long will that take?

24:23.170 --> 24:25.213
I can't really say. It could be hours.

24:25.381 --> 24:28.675
But we'll let you know
just as soon as you can see him.

24:30.344 --> 24:31.970
Thank you.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.812
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.981
Get some rest?

24:43.357 --> 24:45.692
I'm not going anywhere.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.819
Me neither.

24:53.701 --> 24:57.704
Well, is anyone else
dying to brush their teeth...

24:57.872 --> 24:59.539
...or is it just me?

25:01.208 --> 25:04.043
What if I ran over to the house
and picked up a few things?

25:04.211 --> 25:06.838
Marie? I could swing by your place.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.175
That would be great. Thanks, Walt.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.553
Okay.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.695
Walt. Walt.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.906
We just heard he came through.

25:33.073 --> 25:36.534
Yeah, well, it's, you know,
guardedly good news.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.620
- Thank God. I'll take it.
- Yeah.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.956
Hey, guys,
this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.292
- Good to meet you. Hi.
- Hey.

25:44.460 --> 25:48.046
- We were just swapping Hank stories.
- That could go on all day.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.423
God knows,
there's a million of them.

25:52.092 --> 25:55.553
- Meanwhile...
- Miserable piece of shit.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.306
Guy who shot him, one that's left,
he's up there.

25:58.474 --> 26:01.309
Got the painkillers going on,
resting comfortably.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.102
Your tax dollars at work.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.772
You ought to see what Hank did
to that bastard.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.983
Wanna see?

26:10.569 --> 26:11.778
Come on, let me show you.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.718
You comfortable, you piece of shit?

27:33.861 --> 27:36.362
- You got him?
- Come on.

27:36.572 --> 27:40.033
- All right.
- Easy now, easy.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.567
Come here.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.364
No.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.077
Oh, shit.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.794
Yeah.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.016
Finally. About damn time.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.948
Why isn't there anything cooking?

30:01.049 --> 30:03.176
Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.679
- Operator.
- This is Walter White.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.556
I'll connect you.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.687
Yo, we got problems, big ones.

30:14.855 --> 30:18.566
Reverend, so nice of you to call.
Again.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.151
Turn your phone on already.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.362
You know,
I will definitely look into that.

30:23.530 --> 30:27.408
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone?

30:27.576 --> 30:29.035
Okay?

30:30.704 --> 30:34.415
I told you to wait. I don't know
how many more ways I could say it.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.542
Yeah, dick, I was waiting...

30:36.710 --> 30:39.462
...and then that creepy, quiet guy
showed up.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.381
- Gus came by?
- Not him, man.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.884
Apparently
I'm not worthy of meeting him.

30:45.052 --> 30:47.720
The other one.
The one I'm qualified to speak to.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.430
He started asking questions too.

30:49.598 --> 30:53.601
Like why haven't we cooked anything.
All right, we have a quota.

30:53.769 --> 30:57.396
It's due tomorrow.
Do you seriously not care or what?

30:57.564 --> 31:00.441
Because that guy,
he's got, like, the dead eyes.

31:00.609 --> 31:01.901
Let me ask you something.

31:02.069 --> 31:04.779
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with Tuco?

31:04.988 --> 31:08.241
Oh, you mean when he put
a machine gun to my head?

31:08.408 --> 31:11.202
Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell.
Why?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.871
No. He kept... He kept saying...

31:14.039 --> 31:17.708
...that someone was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.419
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

31:20.587 --> 31:24.924
What the hell has this got to do with...?
Look, I don't know. It was...

31:28.095 --> 31:29.762
His cousins.

31:29.930 --> 31:33.224
Right, Jesse? It was...
It was his cousins.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.935
Yeah, cousins.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.645
Whatever, man. Why?

31:56.665 --> 31:58.249
Any news?

31:58.417 --> 32:00.251
No change.

32:02.337 --> 32:08.092
Okay, well, I didn't know
whose toothbrushes were whose...

32:08.260 --> 32:11.262
...so I just stopped by the drugstore.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.806
Thank God for travel sizes, right?

32:13.974 --> 32:15.474
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.603
Yeah.

32:22.691 --> 32:25.359
Oh, I think I'm gonna
go wash my face.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.612
I'm going crazy.

32:28.572 --> 32:31.657
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.500
Nurse Franklin,
please page the operator.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.211
Nurse Franklin, page the operator.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.217
I got candy bars.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.557
Is this what you were asking for?

32:56.725 --> 32:58.809
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

32:58.977 --> 33:02.229
Yeah, I skimmed through it.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.815
- Looks interesting.
- Yeah.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.152
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.325
Well, what's it about?

33:17.120 --> 33:21.832
Pablo Escobar,
this big drug guy in the '80s.

33:22.167 --> 33:25.044
Yeah. Yeah.
I remember seeing him on the news.

33:25.462 --> 33:30.216
Well, it's more about the guys
who investigated him...

33:30.717 --> 33:32.885
...and tried to bring him down.

33:33.053 --> 33:36.055
Some of them were DEA, you know?

33:36.390 --> 33:41.394
Uncle Hank said
that they were worth learning about...

33:41.895 --> 33:44.689
...that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is...

33:44.856 --> 33:48.567
...but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.655
I guess I never thought about it.

33:55.659 --> 34:02.748
He said that good guys never get ink
like the bad guys do.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.759
So he gave it to me.

34:14.261 --> 34:16.595
Figured I'd read it.

34:30.444 --> 34:32.570
I need to...

34:32.738 --> 34:34.739
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

34:41.496 --> 34:45.916
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work. Absolutely.

34:46.334 --> 34:49.754
So I can expect delivery by tomorrow
as scheduled.

34:50.464 --> 34:51.964
Well...

34:52.716 --> 34:54.467
Unfortunately...

34:54.634 --> 34:56.343
Unfortunately...

34:56.511 --> 35:00.681
...we're not going to be able
to keep our schedule this week.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.100
But not for lack of trying.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.311
Is there something I should know?

35:05.479 --> 35:09.315
Well, to be completely honest
with you...

35:10.275 --> 35:12.651
...Gale really screwed us up.

35:12.819 --> 35:16.822
I mean, not on purpose, of course,
but he just... He set us way back.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.784
And we've been playing catch-up
ever since.

35:21.119 --> 35:25.331
And I've had to be out
running errands...

35:25.499 --> 35:27.833
...and trying to keep us on target.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.338
Some of the equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly...

35:32.506 --> 35:35.508
Well, it's just all very technical
and boring.

35:35.675 --> 35:38.803
But rest assured that...

35:38.970 --> 35:41.263
That we will do whatever it takes.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.682
It has my total attention.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.060
We'll cook through the weekend
if necessary.

35:46.853 --> 35:51.273
We will have 400 pounds for you
by next week.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.529
I have your word on that?

35:56.696 --> 36:00.199
You do. You have my word on that.

36:01.535 --> 36:03.869
Thank you for the update.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.227
Yeah. Right.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.106
Any news?

36:32.315 --> 36:36.235
No, I'm just wandering.

36:36.945 --> 36:41.740
- How's everybody doing?
- Well, as well as can be expected.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.952
It's this not knowing...

36:45.120 --> 36:47.580
...that's the hardest part, I think.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.417
Anything new on these guys?

36:51.585 --> 36:53.586
Who they are? What they wanted?

36:53.753 --> 36:57.631
No, nothing yet, but we'll get it.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.596
Steve...

37:05.473 --> 37:08.434
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

37:09.603 --> 37:12.605
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.107
That was their one shot
and they blew it.

37:15.275 --> 37:17.610
So no.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.154
No way.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.948
Jesus.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.660
I'd love to walk in there and shoot
that bastard right in the head.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.454
Me too.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.422
Yeah?

37:38.965 --> 37:40.174
Oh, yeah?

37:40.383 --> 37:42.927
Great. We'll be right down.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.345
Food's here.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.472
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

37:46.640 --> 37:49.266
- You guys coming?
- Yeah.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.103
- On occasion, yeah.
- Owner's a big booster for the DEA.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.607
He heard what happened. He's gonna
feed every cop in the building.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.361
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.489
And, apparently,
he's bringing it by personally.

38:12.123 --> 38:15.000
- I don't even know what to say.
- That's an incredible...

38:15.168 --> 38:17.836
- Good, huh?
- Delicious.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.965
That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.509
Yes, thank you.
Guys, did you hear that?

38:23.677 --> 38:26.345
Mr. Fring is offering
a 10,000-dollar reward...

38:26.513 --> 38:28.555
...on any information about the case.

38:28.723 --> 38:32.518
Well, that's... That's wonderful.

38:32.686 --> 38:34.687
Wow, thank you, Mr. Fring.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.523
You're very welcome.
Men like your husband...

38:37.691 --> 38:40.526
...are the thin blue line
between us and these animals.

38:40.694 --> 38:42.027
I only wish I could do more.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.827
Well, we do appreciate your support.

38:49.995 --> 38:54.456
This reward could turn the tide here.
It'll really help.

38:55.208 --> 38:58.544
Again,
I can't express how sorry I am.

38:58.712 --> 39:01.005
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

39:02.340 --> 39:06.218
- Really?
- Our fund run, couple of months ago.

39:06.386 --> 39:09.388
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.

39:09.723 --> 39:13.100
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

39:13.560 --> 39:18.230
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.859
Really?

39:22.736 --> 39:26.530
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you...

39:26.698 --> 39:29.450
...and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.703
I hope that there's been good news.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.750
Things have improved, yes.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.127
That's wonderful to hear.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.714
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

39:45.884 --> 39:49.928
Well, I have taken up
enough of your time.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.809
Thank you again very much.
It was a great pleasure to meet you.

39:56.019 --> 39:58.062
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

40:00.106 --> 40:03.442
- Let me walk you out.
- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

40:05.278 --> 40:06.945
It's amazing.

40:09.115 --> 40:12.117
You know, I didn't say thank you.

40:12.285 --> 40:15.162
I'll walk him out. Be right back.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.793
Good to see you.
Enjoy the chicken?

40:20.960 --> 40:23.629
- Good. Good.
- Excuse me.

40:23.797 --> 40:27.174
My pleasure. My pleasure.

40:27.342 --> 40:28.926
Thank you. Thank you.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.969
- It's good chicken, huh? Good.
- Yeah.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.305
- Mr. Fring.
- Mr. White.

40:33.473 --> 40:36.809
- I just wanted to thank you again.
- It's my pleasure.

40:36.976 --> 40:41.063
May I...? May I speak with you?
Just a moment.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.152
You knew.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.989
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.368
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.162
What careful man wouldn't?

40:57.705 --> 41:02.292
He is not a problem for us,
for our business.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.507
Your being here is...

41:09.843 --> 41:12.010
Is this some sort of message?

41:12.178 --> 41:14.513
I'm supporting my community.

41:14.681 --> 41:17.391
I hide in plain sight, same as you.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.351
- Are we done?
- No, listen, I...

41:19.519 --> 41:22.896
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't understand it.

41:23.106 --> 41:25.023
I don't know what it means.

41:25.859 --> 41:29.319
Please,
if you have some knowledge...

41:29.487 --> 41:31.697
...that you could share with me...

41:36.327 --> 41:38.537
I fear for my family.

41:38.872 --> 41:40.122
I'm sure they'll be fine.

41:40.540 --> 41:44.042
I am told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.378
It's doubtful he'll live.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.551
Now thank me and shake my hand.

41:56.639 --> 42:00.893
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.230
Did you hear that?

42:09.235 --> 42:11.570
- We're going up?
- Come on.

42:11.905 --> 42:13.697
What's going on?

42:14.532 --> 42:16.241
What's happening?

42:16.576 --> 42:20.078
Starting chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.080
- One, two, three...
- Defib?

42:22.248 --> 42:25.167
Patient is in asystole.
Continuing chest compressions.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.252
One, two, three, four.

42:27.420 --> 42:29.796
- Give me a liter of saline.
- I can't get a pulse.

42:30.215 --> 42:31.548
One, two, three, four.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.927
- Still nothing.
- All right, stopping compressions.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.387
- Time?
- Eight forty-three.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.598
Time of death, 20:43.

42:41.726 --> 42:44.770
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

43:10.797 --> 43:12.464
Yes? Juan?

43:12.632 --> 43:14.341
I assume you heard the news.

43:14.509 --> 43:17.177
Your man died. I heard.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.972
- It's unfortunate.
- Yeah, unfortunate.

43:20.139 --> 43:22.975
And meanwhile, I have Federales
surrounding my house.

43:23.142 --> 43:26.853
You know what I think, Gustavo?
I think you're behind all this.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.314
Why would I do this?

43:29.482 --> 43:32.693
- How would it serve me?
- That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.028
Go off on your own, maybe.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.197
Would you actually think
that would work?

43:37.365 --> 43:40.158
Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.

43:40.326 --> 43:43.328
You should call me back when
you're seeing things more clearly.

43:43.496 --> 43:45.122
I see things clear enough.

43:45.290 --> 43:48.834
One DEA gets shot,
all of Washington starts barking.

43:49.002 --> 43:51.169
The D.F. suddenly has to
put on a big show...

43:51.337 --> 43:54.047
...and I wind up with Federales
in my rosebushes.

43:54.257 --> 43:55.966
But just for a while.

43:56.301 --> 44:00.178
Appearances, politics.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.347
Are you still there, Gustavo?

44:02.515 --> 44:04.182
Yes.

44:04.517 --> 44:05.642
I'm here.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.353
I'll weather this. I always do.

44:08.521 --> 44:10.022
My brother's a police chief.

44:10.189 --> 44:12.858
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

44:13.026 --> 44:15.193
And when I get proof...

44:15.361 --> 44:18.196
...and the others find out
what you've done...

44:18.698 --> 44:21.408
...maybe we come pay you a visit.

44:21.576 --> 44:23.410
Maybe we can...

45:10.958 --> 45:15.253
Skyler. Skyler. Marie. Marie.

45:15.755 --> 45:18.215
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

45:18.383 --> 45:21.760
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

45:21.928 --> 45:24.388
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid it's immediate family only.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.556
- We're all family.
- I understand.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.726
But we have a certain protocol here
that we need...

45:29.894 --> 45:32.354
We're all family.
