"Breaking Bad Season 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 + Extras BDRip DVDRip HDTV TSV"

02:02.623 --> 02:05.834
Surprised he doesn't
make us do that.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.797
The pack totally has a pecking order.

02:11.006 --> 02:14.718
And the head hyena,
he's the man, you know.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.429
All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.723
I mean, literally. It's so gross.

02:19.890 --> 02:23.101
They have to lick his junk.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.772
I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

02:29.942 --> 02:34.821
Yo, if this is supposed to be all,
like, major-league and all...

02:35.030 --> 02:39.826
...we should have... equipment
maintainer guys.

02:41.954 --> 02:45.374
And water boys, you know?

02:46.124 --> 02:49.253
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.090
Get us a couple flunkies in here.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.217
Treat us right.

03:05.561 --> 03:09.690
Okay, 15 hours starts now.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.192
I'm gonna hit it,
if that's cool with you.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.070
- I don't understand.
- What?

03:15.279 --> 03:17.364
These numbers,
they just don't add up.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.783
Told you. Dude's totally boning us.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.661
No, it's not that.

03:22.828 --> 03:27.666
It's our output. We're off.
We're.14 percent off.

03:27.875 --> 03:32.087
Point one-four. That's, what, like...?

03:32.296 --> 03:33.714
What does that mean?

03:33.922 --> 03:37.593
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.389
So how far off are we?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.975
It's not negligible.

03:46.351 --> 03:51.607
Ball-parking at it, I'd say
we're a quarter to a half a pound shy.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.569
That's weird.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.654
Well, what about spillage?

03:58.864 --> 03:59.907
Spillage?

04:00.115 --> 04:02.242
You know, when,
like, just stuff gets spilled.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.369
Nothing gets spilled.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.787
A little maybe.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.581
Nothing gets spilled.

04:08.207 --> 04:10.042
What about evaporation?

04:10.751 --> 04:14.546
It wouldn't account for this much.
The materials aren't out that long.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.507
What about the other one?

04:16.715 --> 04:19.510
The drops, like on...

04:20.052 --> 04:21.637
Like on, like, cold beer.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.264
- Condensation?
- Yeah.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.016
No.

04:27.309 --> 04:30.270
Well, what about the crap
that gets left behind?

04:30.437 --> 04:33.357
You know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.902
Gotta add up to like a gallon each.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.279
Did you work that in?

04:39.696 --> 04:44.368
- Vestiges.
- Yeah. Vestiges.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.122
Bet that's it.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.667
Bet that's totally it.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.756
Hey, Mr. White.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.342
Mr. White.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.846
Are you okay?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.682
Yeah. Yeah, why?

05:09.351 --> 05:10.936
Nothing.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.323
Are you coming?

05:24.074 --> 05:26.159
Yeah, in a minute.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.788
All right, see you tomorrow.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.185
All right.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.817
Shit.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.571
Bastard.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.417
Son of a...

07:11.348 --> 07:13.016
Come on, you...

07:13.308 --> 07:15.018
Come on, come on.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.608
Son of a...

07:42.671 --> 07:43.714
Come on.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.721
Son of a bitch.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.614
That's great.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.560
All right.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.125
You little bastard.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.521
Shut the door!

10:45.729 --> 10:49.691
- My ears are popping.
- Shut the door. Move.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.611
Feels like on an airplane.
What the hell's doing that?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.988
Positive pressure.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.865
Positive what?

10:57.074 --> 10:58.367
God, it frigging kills, yo.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.245
- Well, just move your jaw around.
- I am moving it around.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.539
- It's not working.
- Just yawn or something.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.457
Stop acting like such a baby.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.709
Damn.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.254
What positive? Positive what?

11:10.462 --> 11:15.717
Pressure. I've turned the ventilation up
to keep the outside out.

11:15.926 --> 11:19.137
There's been a contamination.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.640
Wait. What?

11:21.807 --> 11:23.725
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hold up.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.853
Something got into the lab.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.564
So, what do we do?

11:28.772 --> 11:29.898
I mean, do we...?

11:30.107 --> 11:32.693
Wait. Wait. I mean,
shouldn't we be wearing masks?

11:32.901 --> 11:36.613
No, no, it's not that kind
of contaminant.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.491
So it's, like, not dangerous?

11:39.741 --> 11:42.578
Mr. White, talk to me here.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.999
Not to us particularly, no.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.710
What the hell is that?

11:50.252 --> 11:52.462
This is...

11:52.671 --> 11:54.381
I made it.

11:55.924 --> 12:00.053
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.060
A fly.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.480
What do you mean?

12:10.689 --> 12:13.275
A fly, like... Like, what do you mean?

12:13.483 --> 12:17.237
I mean, a fly. A housefly.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.825
Like one fly?

12:22.409 --> 12:23.619
Singular?

12:24.828 --> 12:26.580
- What did it do?
- It got into the lab.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.916
I'm trying to get it out.
Okay? Understand?

12:29.791 --> 12:35.464
No, man, not really. I can't say that
I'm really following you here.

12:36.340 --> 12:39.134
Dude, you scared the shit out of me!

12:39.343 --> 12:41.303
When you say it's contamination,
I mean...

12:41.512 --> 12:43.764
...I'm thinking like an Ebola leak
or something.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.015
Ebola.

12:45.224 --> 12:47.768
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel...

12:47.976 --> 12:51.021
...where all your intestines sort of
just slip out of your butt.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.732
Thank you. I know what Ebola is.
Now, tell me.

12:53.941 --> 12:58.737
What would a West African virus
be doing in our lab?

12:59.196 --> 13:06.411
So you're chasing around a fly
and in your world, I'm the idiot.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.831
Jesse, listen.

13:10.040 --> 13:14.211
This fly...
No, any fly cannot be in our lab.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.505
It's a problem. It's a contamination.

13:16.713 --> 13:20.092
And that is in no way a misuse
of the word. Okay?

13:20.300 --> 13:26.265
So in terms of keeping our cook clean
and our product unadulterated...

13:26.473 --> 13:28.809
...we need to take this very seriously.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.686
Now do you understand?

13:34.106 --> 13:35.983
So is that your fly-saber?

13:38.443 --> 13:39.862
This is a swatter.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.739
And it happens to work quite well,
thank you.

13:42.948 --> 13:46.243
Hey, what happened to your head?

13:46.451 --> 13:47.911
Nothing. I'm fine.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.123
You didn't hit it,
like really, really hard?

13:51.331 --> 13:55.586
My head is not the problem, Jesse.
The fly is the problem.

13:56.795 --> 14:03.385
You didn't happen to maybe try
our product, did you?

14:03.594 --> 14:07.222
Jesse, I know this seems unusual
to you, a layman.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.976
A fly. I get it.
It seems insignificant, right?

14:11.185 --> 14:15.397
But trust me, in a highly controlled
environment such as this...

14:18.942 --> 14:20.319
...any pollutant...

14:22.070 --> 14:24.323
...no matter how small...

14:27.868 --> 14:30.204
...could completely...

14:44.218 --> 14:45.219
Hello?

14:47.846 --> 14:49.097
What?

14:52.434 --> 14:55.312
Were you here all night?

14:55.646 --> 14:57.231
Have you even slept?

14:57.439 --> 14:59.942
No. Jesse, look. I'm fine, okay?

15:00.150 --> 15:02.402
Will you just please focus on...?

15:07.574 --> 15:10.452
Okay, look, we're running late,
so let's just get started.

15:10.661 --> 15:12.746
The sooner we do it,
the sooner we're done.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.666
Fricking finally.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.130
What are you doing?

15:22.339 --> 15:24.383
It's time to alkaline.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.719
Have you not heard a word I said?

15:27.928 --> 15:31.139
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.600
Have I been speaking to myself?

15:33.809 --> 15:36.061
The timer went off, yo.

15:36.270 --> 15:39.356
How long is this batch gonna be
good for? An hour? Two?

15:39.565 --> 15:43.360
The batch will be good for nothing
if we don't clear the contaminant.

15:43.569 --> 15:45.571
"Clear the contaminant."

15:45.779 --> 15:48.323
We're making meth here, all right?
Not space shuttles.

15:48.532 --> 15:52.160
We're making nothing until
we catch this fly.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.495
What fly? All right?

15:53.704 --> 15:57.374
Where the hell is this fly?
Not like I even seen the thing.

15:57.583 --> 16:00.919
Maybe your positive pressure blew it
out the door or something.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.839
No, no, it is here. It is around, okay?

16:04.464 --> 16:07.801
He's around, and I am not going
to expose this batch...

16:08.010 --> 16:10.220
...to the open air and contamination,
period.

16:10.429 --> 16:13.891
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself or you can help me.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.226
But you are right.
We're running out of time.

16:16.435 --> 16:19.021
So I need your answer right now.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.404
Okay.

16:37.164 --> 16:41.418
Hey, tick-tock, yo.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.720
Look, I like making cherry product,
but let's keep it real, all right?

16:51.929 --> 16:56.058
We make poison for people
who don't care.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.019
We probably have the most un-picky
customers in the world.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.813
No, no, no. No rationalizing.

17:02.022 --> 17:05.067
We'll find it any minute.
Don't give up.

17:17.162 --> 17:22.751
Did you know that there's
an acceptable level of rat turds...

17:22.960 --> 17:26.088
...that can go into candy bars?

17:26.880 --> 17:29.591
That's the government, Jack.

17:29.800 --> 17:36.390
Even the government doesn't care
that much about quality.

17:37.015 --> 17:43.605
You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs, huh?

17:43.814 --> 17:46.650
Pig lips and assholes.

17:46.859 --> 17:53.156
But I say, hey, have at it, bitches,
because I love hotdogs.

17:53.365 --> 17:57.327
- And, you know, see what I'm try...?
- What are you doing?

17:57.536 --> 18:00.330
Oh, hey.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.710
Look, let me just top it off,
all right, really quick.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.462
You know, a little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid.

18:07.629 --> 18:10.215
No harm done. Then we're golden.

18:15.179 --> 18:17.514
It stays closed. That's an order.

18:17.931 --> 18:24.021
You can't order shit, Adolf, all right?
We're 50-50 partners, remember?

18:30.527 --> 18:32.404
God, what is your problem?

18:35.240 --> 18:38.202
Freaking psycho.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.746
- Jesse.
- Oh, God.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.749
- It, like, hit bone.
- Jesse.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.542
Jesse.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.964
You see it, right?

18:51.924 --> 18:53.509
You see it?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.302
Yeah.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.473
Get it.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.101
You want me to get it?

19:03.644 --> 19:05.020
Yes.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.736
Slow. Move slowly.

19:12.945 --> 19:15.989
I know. I'm moving slowly, yeah.

19:16.156 --> 19:19.535
Absolutely. I'm just gonna need
your swatter thing.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.290
Come on.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.460
Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.295
Yeah.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.881
- Yeah, come on.
- Just make it count.

19:33.090 --> 19:36.969
Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make it count, all right.

19:37.177 --> 19:40.973
Okay. Now, on three.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.558
Okay.

19:42.766 --> 19:43.892
One...

19:44.768 --> 19:46.436
Motherfuck...!

19:46.645 --> 19:51.024
Yeah. You like that, huh?
Hurts, huh?

19:54.152 --> 19:56.822
- Did you get it?
- I think so, yeah.

19:56.989 --> 19:59.491
- Where is it?
- I don't know. What does it matter?

19:59.700 --> 20:01.535
Who cares? I got it.

20:01.743 --> 20:05.080
- Oh, Jesus, seriously?
- Where is it?

20:05.789 --> 20:09.168
It's right there. Look.

20:09.334 --> 20:13.463
Look. See? I told you I got it.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.600
This is a raisin.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.854
Look, I definitely got it, man, all ri...

20:30.814 --> 20:32.733
Oh, man.

20:33.317 --> 20:36.028
He's got some skills, yo.

20:36.195 --> 20:37.738
I'll give him that.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.907
Look.

20:41.742 --> 20:46.038
I feel like I'm running out of ways
to explain this to you...

20:46.246 --> 20:49.499
...but once more, I shall try.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.629
This fly is a major problem for us.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.548
It will ruin our batch.

20:56.757 --> 21:01.386
And we need to destroy it
and every trace of it so we can cook.

21:02.638 --> 21:04.681
Failing that...

21:07.100 --> 21:09.019
...we're dead.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.275
There is no more room for error.

21:17.069 --> 21:19.321
Not with these people.

21:21.782 --> 21:24.576
All right, how about we go
get some air?

21:26.161 --> 21:27.621
"Get some air"?

21:27.829 --> 21:30.207
Your answer to,
"We're sliding headfirst...

21:30.415 --> 21:32.876
...into a massive crap..."
- Hey, hey, hey, Mr. White.

21:33.043 --> 21:36.296
All right, I understand that the fly
is a serious thing now.

21:36.505 --> 21:37.673
All right? I'm on board.

21:37.881 --> 21:41.009
I'm just saying, you know,
maybe if we went and got some air...

21:41.218 --> 21:44.930
...it would help us come up with a plan
on how to catch it.

21:45.138 --> 21:48.809
Then come back down here
and subtract his ass.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.207
- Oh, wait, do you have your keys?
- Yeah.

22:12.374 --> 22:15.252
You sure? Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.380
Yeah. Hey!

22:18.589 --> 22:21.258
If you're not gonna help me,
stay out of my way!

22:21.466 --> 22:22.926
Hey!

22:28.807 --> 22:32.144
Yo, yo, does somebody have
an axe I can use?

23:05.886 --> 23:08.555
There we go.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.229
Say good night.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.816
Son of a bitch!

23:23.487 --> 23:25.531
Son of a...

23:28.075 --> 23:29.701
Damn it.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.206
Where in the hell is that...?

23:51.640 --> 23:53.350
What the hell?

23:57.271 --> 24:01.149
Need some juice maybe?

24:03.902 --> 24:05.863
Knock yourself out.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.281
It's a real one.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.408
Yeah, like yours was working.

24:09.616 --> 24:12.744
No, no, no.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.913
Look, we're trying to decontaminate.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.791
You don't decontaminate by
contaminating further.

24:17.958 --> 24:20.043
What the hell is all this?

24:21.628 --> 24:24.214
Here, how about this?

24:24.756 --> 24:26.717
"Non-toxic glue strips."

24:26.925 --> 24:30.179
Yeah, baby. It's got pheromones,
all right? I got a butt-load.

24:30.387 --> 24:33.807
We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.732
I sure hope we have... enough.

24:42.357 --> 24:46.195
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say yeah.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.614
Do you see him?

24:50.657 --> 24:53.160
How long do you think
you've been awake?

24:53.368 --> 24:55.120
Why do you keep asking me that?

24:55.329 --> 24:59.875
Just figure, you know, you could use
some coffee, is all. I know I could.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.919
How about it?

25:03.837 --> 25:05.339
Yeah.

25:07.841 --> 25:10.761
- You take cream and sugar?
- Black is fine.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.151
Why don't you just leave him be?

25:26.360 --> 25:28.570
Let the traps do the work.

25:29.029 --> 25:32.950
These pheromones are supposed
to kick ass.

25:33.784 --> 25:37.996
Bet we catch this mofo any second.

25:51.093 --> 25:52.594
Thank you.

25:53.595 --> 25:59.685
You ever have, like, a wild animal
trapped in your house?

26:03.230 --> 26:06.316
Not that I can recall, no.

26:06.525 --> 26:11.697
We did, this one time,
back when it was my aunt's house...

26:11.905 --> 26:14.950
...back before she died of cancer.

26:15.617 --> 26:20.289
It was a possum.
Big freaky-looking bitch.

26:20.497 --> 26:23.458
Hey, since when did they change it
to "opossum"?

26:23.667 --> 26:27.713
What's up with that? I mean, when
I was coming up, it was just "possum."

26:27.921 --> 26:31.383
You know, "opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

26:31.592 --> 26:35.095
I mean, why they gotta go
changing everything?

26:35.304 --> 26:37.681
Whatever. It's just big rats anyways.

26:37.890 --> 26:41.810
Giant pink-tailed rats
with their pink rat faces.

26:42.019 --> 26:46.857
Totally freaky, like alien rats.

26:48.734 --> 26:51.945
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped...

26:52.154 --> 26:56.283
...but he was living there,
you know, under the house.

26:56.491 --> 26:59.620
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room...

26:59.828 --> 27:02.831
...always scurrying around.

27:03.040 --> 27:08.253
Sometimes I'd see him outside at night
and it would just, you know, freeze.

27:08.545 --> 27:11.798
I mean, it's like you're not looking
right at it, right?

27:12.007 --> 27:14.843
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.

27:15.052 --> 27:18.514
That's what they do.
I mean, they play dead or whatever.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.391
It's just so lame.

27:21.558 --> 27:25.854
Is there a discernible point
to this story?

27:26.605 --> 27:31.985
A point that you'll be arriving at
sometime in the near future?

27:32.736 --> 27:36.365
It was just a total bitch to get out.
You know, it took forever.

27:36.573 --> 27:43.163
Guy came, set all these traps and all
and he finally got it.

27:43.372 --> 27:48.001
But my aunt, you know,
she didn't believe it.

27:48.961 --> 27:53.340
I mean, she kept insisting
she could still hear the thing.

27:53.549 --> 27:56.343
I mean, you could not tell her
any different.

27:56.552 --> 28:00.681
She started keeping an old umbrella,
you know, by her chair.

28:00.973 --> 28:03.934
Man, she would just bang on the floor
and yell at it.

28:04.142 --> 28:06.478
Even gave it a name.

28:06.687 --> 28:10.399
It was Scrabble.

28:10.607 --> 28:11.859
Yeah, that was it.

28:12.067 --> 28:15.821
You know,
"Scrabble, just knock it off:"

28:18.407 --> 28:22.327
She got like that toward the... end.

28:23.495 --> 28:29.877
Got obsessive about stuff.
Just got mad about stuff.

28:30.294 --> 28:32.546
We didn't know what was up.

28:33.213 --> 28:37.467
It wasn't like her to be that way.

28:40.470 --> 28:46.059
But it turned out that the cancer
had spread to her brain...

28:46.268 --> 28:48.562
...and that was why.

28:49.521 --> 28:53.317
It metastasized.

28:55.110 --> 29:01.116
But it was good that that was when
we decided to take her to the doctor...

29:01.325 --> 29:03.619
...because then we knew
what was up.

29:04.453 --> 29:06.663
You know, got her some treatment.

29:07.247 --> 29:10.667
Meds, so she wasn't stressing
all the time.

29:14.505 --> 29:18.175
It was a lot better after that.

29:18.550 --> 29:22.095
You know, she was a lot happier.

29:29.895 --> 29:31.897
Where the hell is he?

29:40.697 --> 29:43.909
I've been to my oncologist, Jesse...

29:44.117 --> 29:45.911
...just last week.

29:48.163 --> 29:50.624
I'm still in remission.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.418
I'm healthy.

29:53.627 --> 29:58.465
Okay, so good. Great.

30:00.551 --> 30:01.593
Well...

30:02.636 --> 30:04.972
...no end in sight.

30:05.931 --> 30:08.267
That's great.

30:10.477 --> 30:12.187
Well...

30:12.896 --> 30:14.815
...I missed it.

30:20.153 --> 30:27.244
There was some perfect moment
and it passed me right by.

30:29.079 --> 30:33.792
I had to have... enough to leave them.

30:34.001 --> 30:36.253
That was the whole point.

30:37.129 --> 30:39.798
I mean, none of this...

30:40.048 --> 30:44.720
None of this makes any sense
if I didn't have... enough.

30:46.013 --> 30:50.475
But it had to be
before she found out. Skyler.

30:50.684 --> 30:53.145
It had to be before that.

30:53.353 --> 30:57.941
Perfect moment for what?

30:59.234 --> 31:01.320
To drop dead?

31:02.321 --> 31:04.740
What, you saying you wanna die?

31:07.367 --> 31:11.955
I'm saying I've lived too long.

31:13.707 --> 31:15.125
I mean...

31:15.334 --> 31:19.630
...you want them to actually miss you,
you know?

31:20.589 --> 31:25.093
You want their memories of you
to be...

31:27.888 --> 31:29.848
But she just won't...

31:30.057 --> 31:33.018
She just won't understand.

31:33.227 --> 31:37.898
I mean, no matter how well
I explain it...

31:38.106 --> 31:41.109
...these days, she just has this...

31:41.318 --> 31:42.861
This...

31:44.821 --> 31:50.160
I mean, I truly believe there... exists
some combination of words.

31:50.327 --> 31:55.999
There must exist certain words
in a certain specific order...

31:56.208 --> 32:01.547
...that would explain all of this,
but with her, I just...

32:01.755 --> 32:04.591
I just can't ever seem to find them.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.969
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

32:07.177 --> 32:10.013
You know, I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state...

32:10.222 --> 32:13.517
...but before the fugue state,
I didn't have... enough money.

32:13.725 --> 32:17.187
So no, not then.

32:25.237 --> 32:29.366
And plus,
my daughter wasn't born yet.

32:30.242 --> 32:32.828
It had to be after Holly was born.

32:33.036 --> 32:34.663
Mr. White...

32:34.872 --> 32:37.624
Definitely before the surgery.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.545
Oh, Christ.

32:41.962 --> 32:44.047
That damn second cell phone.

32:44.256 --> 32:46.800
I mean, how could I possibly...?

32:57.519 --> 32:59.730
I know the moment.

33:03.859 --> 33:06.695
It was the night Jane died.

33:11.992 --> 33:14.119
Yeah, I...

33:15.495 --> 33:20.334
I was at home
and we needed diapers...

33:20.542 --> 33:25.255
...and so I said I'd go,
but it was just an excuse.

33:25.464 --> 33:29.885
Actually, that was the night
I brought you your money, remember?

33:30.093 --> 33:33.138
Yeah, I remember.

33:33.639 --> 33:37.351
But afterward, I stopped at a bar.

33:37.935 --> 33:42.773
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

33:42.981 --> 33:46.652
I just walked in, sat down.

33:51.031 --> 33:53.200
I never told you.

33:54.034 --> 33:56.119
That you went to a bar?

33:57.287 --> 33:58.664
No, I...

34:00.707 --> 34:05.796
I sit down and this man,
this stranger...

34:06.004 --> 34:08.257
...he... engages me in conversation.

34:08.465 --> 34:10.425
He's a complete stranger.

34:12.261 --> 34:19.142
But he turns out to be Jane's father,
Donald Margolis.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.144
What are you talking about?

34:21.353 --> 34:24.022
Of course, I didn't know it
at the time.

34:24.231 --> 34:27.109
I mean, he was just some guy
in a bar.

34:27.317 --> 34:31.488
I didn't put it together until after the
crash when he was all over the news.

34:31.697 --> 34:33.657
Jane's dad.

34:33.866 --> 34:36.660
I mean, think of the odds.

34:37.661 --> 34:41.498
Once I tried to calculate them,
but they're astronomical.

34:41.707 --> 34:46.420
I mean, think of the odds of me
going in, sitting down...

34:46.628 --> 34:50.757
...that night in that bar
next to that man.

34:53.427 --> 34:55.429
What did you talk about?

35:00.309 --> 35:02.644
Water on Mars.

35:05.939 --> 35:07.733
Family.

35:09.735 --> 35:12.821
What about family?

35:15.365 --> 35:20.829
I told him that I had a daughter
and he told me he had one too.

35:21.455 --> 35:23.207
Then he said:

35:23.582 --> 35:25.792
"Never give up on family."

35:28.712 --> 35:30.589
And I didn't.

35:33.383 --> 35:35.677
I took his advice.

35:50.025 --> 35:53.028
The universe is random.
It's not inevitable.

35:53.237 --> 35:56.281
It's simple chaos.

35:56.490 --> 36:01.203
It's subatomic particles
in endless aimless collision.

36:01.411 --> 36:04.164
That's what science teaches us.

36:04.831 --> 36:07.125
But what is this saying?

36:08.794 --> 36:15.843
What is it telling us when, on the very
night that this man's daughter dies...

36:16.260 --> 36:20.889
...it's me who's having a drink
with him?

36:23.600 --> 36:26.311
I mean, how can that be random?

36:26.687 --> 36:29.314
Hey, come on. Hey, sit down.

36:29.523 --> 36:32.734
No, no. No, it's...

36:35.696 --> 36:38.740
No. No.

36:42.703 --> 36:47.332
No, that was the moment.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.669
That night.

36:53.714 --> 36:56.466
I should never have left home.

36:59.052 --> 37:01.722
Never gone to your house.

37:06.351 --> 37:09.563
Maybe things would have...

37:14.276 --> 37:17.696
Oh, thought I was...

37:19.573 --> 37:23.619
I was at home watching TV.

37:24.620 --> 37:26.371
It was some...

37:27.206 --> 37:31.960
Some nature program
about elephants.

37:33.921 --> 37:37.382
And Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

37:39.843 --> 37:43.180
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

37:46.266 --> 37:49.186
She was singing a lullaby.

37:57.569 --> 38:02.366
If I had just lived right up
to that moment...

38:02.908 --> 38:05.702
...and not one second more...

38:18.298 --> 38:20.926
...that would have been perfect.

38:34.982 --> 38:37.526
He's not coming down.

38:37.734 --> 38:40.946
Must be Thailand-hot up there.

38:41.238 --> 38:43.282
That's why he likes it.

38:44.575 --> 38:47.035
Thailand's hot, right?

38:48.704 --> 38:49.746
Yeah.

38:49.955 --> 38:52.624
Then that's why.

38:53.500 --> 38:58.005
- Oh, Jesus.
- Hey, hey, wait. Here.

39:12.227 --> 39:14.813
He's not coming down.

39:16.690 --> 39:19.151
He's staying up there forever.

39:44.301 --> 39:46.595
What are you...? What are you doing?

39:46.803 --> 39:50.432
What do you think?
I'm gonna get that bitch.

39:54.728 --> 39:57.356
No, you're gonna break your neck.

39:57.564 --> 39:59.900
Yeah, yeah. Just...

40:01.944 --> 40:05.322
No, seriously, you're...
This is a bad idea.

40:06.532 --> 40:08.408
Damn it.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.160
Jesse.

40:10.369 --> 40:11.495
Just hold onto it.

40:11.954 --> 40:13.914
Hold it still?

40:27.594 --> 40:29.471
Jesse.

40:34.101 --> 40:35.561
I'm sorry.

40:35.769 --> 40:39.606
Sorry for what, being a lunatic?

40:42.943 --> 40:45.529
I'm sorry about Jane.

40:51.952 --> 40:53.579
Yeah.

40:54.454 --> 40:56.373
Me too.

40:58.375 --> 41:00.127
I mean...

41:03.046 --> 41:07.217
...I'm very sorry.

41:12.014 --> 41:14.266
It's not your fault.

41:15.058 --> 41:18.103
It's not mine... either.

41:18.312 --> 41:22.524
It's no one's fault, not even hers.

41:33.785 --> 41:37.664
You know, we are who we are,
Mr. White.

41:37.873 --> 41:43.337
You know, two junkies
with a duffel bag full of cash.

41:43.629 --> 41:48.342
Like you said, we both would've
been dead within a week.

41:49.051 --> 41:51.136
But I miss her, though.

41:55.140 --> 41:57.309
God, I do.

42:05.275 --> 42:06.485
Jesse.

42:07.152 --> 42:08.904
Come down.

42:09.112 --> 42:12.449
Wait. I'm so close.

42:15.035 --> 42:17.079
Let it go.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.498
We need to cook.

42:20.332 --> 42:22.376
What about the contamination?

42:23.961 --> 42:26.547
It's all contaminated.

42:32.052 --> 42:34.179
All right, well...

42:34.930 --> 42:37.099

42:38.934 --> 42:40.936

43:12.342 --> 43:13.927

43:16.805 --> 43:18.932
Did you see that, Mr. Wh...?

44:06.146 --> 44:08.106
Bins are packed?

44:08.649 --> 44:10.734
Bins are packed.

44:11.443 --> 44:12.903
How's the yield?

44:13.111 --> 44:15.489

44:44.518 --> 44:46.687
I couldn't chance saying it inside.

44:46.895 --> 44:50.607
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

44:51.650 --> 44:56.738

44:56.989 --> 45:00.492

45:01.326 --> 45:05.539
You understand?
And if they ever found out...

45:08.292 --> 45:10.836
I didn't take shit.

45:15.883 --> 45:19.386
I'm just saying that
I won't be able to protect you.
