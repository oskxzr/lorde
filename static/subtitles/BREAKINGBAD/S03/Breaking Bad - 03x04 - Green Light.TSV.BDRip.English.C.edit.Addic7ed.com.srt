00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:44,637
<i>So cigarettes and gas is...</i>

3
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,858
$79.70

4
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,765
Crap.

5
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:53,643
Oh, there's an ATM right outside.

6
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,799
Yeah,

7
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:57,089
I don't have a card.

8
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:00,651
Well, you can write
a personal check with ID.

9
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:04,943
Kind of in between banks
right now.

10
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:07,593
You think I

11
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:09,205
could just come back later?

12
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,170
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back.

13
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:18,420
If it were me, I'd be, "Totally,
you know, no problem."

14
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:21,616
But my dad is this
ginormous hardass.

15
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:23,777
He was in Fallujah for a year,

16
00:01:23,952 --> 00:01:26,162
and he always checks
the receipts.

17
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:27,499
I mean, like... always.

18
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,002
I've got to call him.
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,291
Wait, wait, wait.

20
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,631
Hold

21
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:34,458
Hold on a second.

22
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,674
Maybe if we could, um...

23
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:40,846
trade.

24
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:48,873
Ever try it?

25
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:53,674
I mean, I smoke pot
a lot sometimes.

26
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,624
I party.

27
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:56,971
But...

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,603
...But that stuff's
really addictive, right?

29
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,757
Not really. It's just
a media thing. You know?

30
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:03,906
You know?

31
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:09,193
What's it like?

32
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:16,182
It's awesome.

33
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:19,967
Everything's

34
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,344
maximum interesting.

35
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,084
You get these really cold

36
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:31,020
and sharp-like
action dagger feelings.

37
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:35,968
It's awesome.

38
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:39,159
Come on.

39
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,798
What do you say?

40
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:15,442
Have a nice day.

41
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:57,197
<i>Now, how does it feel?</i>

42
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,899
<i>Does it hurt?</i>

43
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:00,632
Yeah, it's tight.

44
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:03,148
Okay, but is it painful?

45
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:05,744
It's hard to breathe.

46
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,924
Well, you need your breathing.

47
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:11,291
Uh, well...

48
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:15,243
...although let's not lose sight of the fact that you
were the victim of a terrible accident, Antonio...

49
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:17,865
...so some discomfort
is to be expected.

50
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,436
Let's go with that one.

51
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,166
Oh, and spread the word. I'm
building a class-action, flight 515.

52
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,846
Victims' families would be great,

53
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,697
but I'll take anyone on he ground

54
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:45,448
who suffered emotionally anxiety, sleeplessness,
you get the picture.

55
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:47,125
Trouble?

56
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:51,210
<i>Ted Beneke?
You cannot be serious.</i>

57
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,375
<i>That guys is a joke. You know what, Walt?
You know what? You called my bluff.</i>

58
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:56,063
<i>I called your...
What does that even mean?</i>

59
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:59,642
<i>You dared me to tell the police,
and I couldn't do it, so you win.</i>

60
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:02,857
<i>If you want to stay in this house,
fine, but we are not married anymore.</i>

61
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:06,038
<i>I told you that I was done
cooking meth, Skyler.</i>

62
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:08,397
<i>Oh, right.
I promised you that. And so what?</i>

63
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:11,049
<i>At least I didn't
run off to go...</i>

64
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,483
<i>Jesus! I mean,
everything that I did, I did for this family.</i>

65
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:17,873
<i>Oh, yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.
Oh, and what is that supposed to mean?</i>

66
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,782
<i>You don't like it?
Then leave</i>

67
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:23,589
<i>and take your
drug money with you. That's what you want.</i>

68
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:25,707
Jesus.

69
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,868
Garbage disposal.

70
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,446
<i>You think this will
get me to move out?</i>

71
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:35,035
<i>You can screw Ted. You can screw the butcher,
the mailman, whoever you want.</i>

72
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:37,423
<i>Screw them all.
I'm not going anywhere.</i>

73
00:05:37,455 --> 00:05:39,269
<i>Good. Suit yourself.</i>

74
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,548
Is this a good or bad thing?

75
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:46,436
<i>You want me to suit myself?</i>

76
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:48,924
<i>I'll suit myself to his face!</i>

77
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:50,368
It's a bad thing.

78
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:02,525
Hello.

79
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:06,054
Ahem. Walter White
to see Ted Beneke.

80
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:09,616
I'm sorry. Mr. Beneke's
on a conference call.

81
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:11,647
Mm-hmm, okay.

82
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:13,662
I will wait.

83
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:16,052
It could be a while.

84
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,330
I have all the time in the world.

85
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:45,653
Okay.

86
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:48,819
Here we go. Okay.

87
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:51,767
Excuse me. Mr. Beneke's
not available. Ted?

88
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:53,482
- Come on.
- Señor...

89
00:06:56,765 --> 00:07:01,032
Ted, I can see you. I can see you standing
right there in your office.

90
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,298
Now, come on.

91
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:06,990
Open the door. Come on, let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

92
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:09,342
Come on, let's be men
about this. Huh? Okay?

93
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:10,606
How about that? Aha.

94
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:15,263
Hey, Walt, I'm kind of
in the middle of something

95
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:17,011
Oh, yes, you are.

96
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,754
So open the door.

97
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:21,352
You're damn right you are.
You're right in the middle.

98
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:23,572
Just open the door,
and let's talk about it, okay?

99
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:26,599
Open the door, Ted, right now.

100
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:31,654
All right, you don't want to be a man about it?
Okay. Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B.

101
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:40,473
¡Walt! ¡Walt!

102
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:41,836
¡Walt!

103
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,071
What are you doing?

104
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,483
I'm talking with Ted.

105
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,140
¡Next time,

106
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:00,607
...you'll open...

107
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:02,665
...the door!

108
00:08:02,963 --> 00:08:04,645
Señor, vamos.

109
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:07,600
I'm just here to talk.

110
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:09,775
I just want to talk to him.

111
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,289
God. Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

112
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,707
I'm just talk... All right. All right,
all right, all right, I'm calm.

113
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,018
¡I'm calm!

114
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:21,607
Fuck.

115
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,665
What do you want?
What do you want?

116
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:45,174
Hey! Hey, come on.

117
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:49,686
What the hell is wrong with you?

118
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:52,463
You act like you're the first
guy this ever happened to.

119
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:56,232
I caught my second wife
screwing my stepdad, okay?

120
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:59,232
It's a cruel world, Walt.
Grow up.

121
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:03,702
I just wanted to talk to him. Yeah,
well, now I'm talking to you.

122
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:06,062
Consider this an intervention.

123
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:08,857
You could have been arrested back there.
You understand.

124
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:12,215
I mean, speaking as your lawyer, I'm
always looking for billable hours,

125
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,454
but speaking
as your business associate,

126
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:18,042
I'm strongly advising that
you get your shit together.

127
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,659
Just cool it with this Beneke
guy, at least for now. Okay?

128
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:25,295
Let's talk shop

129
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:27,930
because I think this is
a great opportunity

130
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:31,534
to channel some of that negative
energy into something positive.

131
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,300
How did you know?

132
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:34,785
Sorry?

133
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:39,258
About Skyler, About where to find me
just now. How did you know?

134
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:41,965
That's just my meticulousness.

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,133
Don't bog down in detail,
Walt. The lesson here...

136
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,863
Did you bug my house?

137
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:54,831
Yeah, but I didn't know it was your house, did I?
You had moved out.

138
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,872
Besides,
you basically told me to.

139
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:59,934
I told you to? You strongly
hinted that I should.

140
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,881
You were worried
about your wife, remember?

141
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,262
You were concerned she might
say something to the police.

142
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:07,763
What? No, no, that's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

143
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,765
Let's not get lost
in the who, what, and whens.

144
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,945
The point is we did our
due diligence,

145
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:18,549
and she didn't talk. She kept quiet.
She stood by you, Walt.

146
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:20,538
Which, if you ask me,

147
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:23,139
is the ironical
silver lining here.

148
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:26,146
I mean, on the one hand,

149
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:29,277
sure, she snuck off the reservation
to get some dirty, damp, and deep.

150
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,384
You're fired!

151
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,619
You're done!
Good.

152
00:10:50,654 --> 00:10:54,806
Oh, boo-hoo, I won't cook meth anymore.
You're a crybaby. Who needs you?

153
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:58,413
Hey, I'm unplugging the Web site, so no more
money laundering. How do you like that?

154
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:01,552
I want those bugs
out of my house today.

155
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:03,262
I want them out now!

156
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,013
Oh, you just bought
a $300 suit, psycho!

157
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,614
<i>Door.</i>

158
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:19,444
Great, drilled right into the stucco.

159
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:25,155
Oh, a little bit of putty, you'll be fine.

160
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,597
Just make sure you get
all of those things.

161
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,263
A, these things cost $800 apiece.

162
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:32,974
These things cost $800 apiece.

163
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:35,060
B, you're not that interesting.

164
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,414
So yeah,
I'll get all of them, Walter.

165
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:41,390
Great line of work, by the way.

166
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:43,831
Real upstanding field.

167
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:46,361
Yep, well...

168
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:49,239
I enjoy it.

169
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:00,182
You're free to leave now.

170
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:01,934
Anytime.

171
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:05,765
You know, Walter,

172
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:10,197
sometimes it doesn't hurt to have someone
watching your back.

173
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,046
Mr. White?

174
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:37,058
Hi.

175
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:40,577
What's up?

176
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:48,677
I can't begin to understand what
you're going through, Walt,

177
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:51,538
with all of your health concerns

178
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:53,929
and the stresses
you've been under.

179
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:59,622
Still, as educators, there are certain
responsibilities we need to be meeting here

180
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:03,413
to the school
and to the students themselves.

181
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:04,978
Yeah, of course.

182
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:09,079
Is this a Wheaten terrier?

183
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:12,760
Uh, Norfolk.

184
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:14,916
Norfolk?

185
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,582
That's surprising.

186
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:22,487
Walt, could you
come back over here and have a seat, please?

187
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:24,795
Sure.

188
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:39,191
You've been absent a lot
recently,

189
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:42,260
and when you are here at school,

190
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,718
there have been
some behavioral questions,

191
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,082
and frankly I'm concerned.

192
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:52,111
Hm. Thank you.

193
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:02,787
Are you feeling okay?

194
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:06,333
And do you think maybe
I should call Skyler?

195
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,484
Um... nah.

196
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:17,455
Let's just

197
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:20,242
keep this...

198
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:23,803
What?

199
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:25,604
Hey!

200
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:29,272
Walt, what's wrong with you?

201
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,966
You know, look,

202
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:14,997
you're the one who was
talking about D.C., okay?

203
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:16,867
This is how you get there.

204
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:19,852
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

205
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:27,440
Besides, it's... you know, it's a
big deal to get picked for this.

206
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,624
El Paso's like

207
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:32,482
the Super Bowl.

208
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:36,905
I could get killed crossing the street, okay? Whatever.

209
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:40,334
I want to go.

210
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,086
What about last time?

211
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:45,496
What about last time?

212
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:09,566
Schrader.

213
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:12,132
Hey, Sheriff. Yeah.

214
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,776
Blue, huh?

215
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:20,160
Yeah, yeah.

216
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:21,712
Thing is, uh...

217
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,384
Thing is I'm supposed to be
getting on a plane right now.

218
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:33,671
The stuff this guy had
was blue. You sure about that?

219
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:37,498
Yeah.

220
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:41,022
I want to talk to him.

221
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:45,669
Taxi!

222
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:28,403
Man, I'm sorry.
I needed to talk to you,

223
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:30,488
but you weren't at your
apartment.

224
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,232
No, I moved back home.

225
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,793
That's good, right?

226
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:40,239
Yo, did you just get fired?

227
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:41,307
No!

228
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:43,227
No. No, no, no, it's, uh...

229
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:46,805
more like a sabbatical.

230
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,901
Indefinite. Yeah.

231
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:04,551
So

232
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:06,356
What's up?

233
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:08,875
Uh, should we go somewhere?

234
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,999
No. This is fine.

235
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,514
So, um, I want an intro
to your guy.

236
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:19,739
What guy?

237
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,640
Your guy.
Your distribution guy,

238
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:27,535
The guy Saul hooked you up with. No,
no, no, no, no. Come on, Jesse.

239
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,563
I thought about it,

240
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:31,778
and I want to.

241
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:33,636
It's the one thing I'm good at.

242
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,253
No, that is just not true.

243
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,351
You're good
at a lot of things, son.

244
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,391
Like what?

245
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,844
What about your sobriety?

246
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:48,826
I told you. I'm not using.

247
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:50,856
Ever.

248
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,931
I just want

249
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:54,632
back into the business.

250
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,686
Well, I don't.

251
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,698
I'm sorry.

252
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:04,961
I know, and that's cool.

253
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,491
I'm not asking you

254
00:20:06,526 --> 00:20:08,410
to cook.

255
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:12,669
What's this?

256
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:14,884
In the end,

257
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,468
I just went

258
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:20,394
with two reflux condensers. I didn't
want to lose track of my Ph levels,

259
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,229
but I did everything else
just like you taught me.

260
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:31,297
Super careful in my amounts and watched
the numbers every step of the way.

261
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:34,247
So what do you think?

262
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:36,114
It's good, right?

263
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:39,821
What

264
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,728
in the hell

265
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,803
is this?

266
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,946
What?

267
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:48,328
What? This. This.

268
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:50,122
This is my product.

269
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:52,404
This is my formula.
This is mine.

270
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:55,488
Okay, it's our product,

271
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,629
but yeah, I was going to cut you in.
You were going to cut me in?

272
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:01,998
No, no, no. I cut you in.

273
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:05,977
What the hell is your problem? All
I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

274
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:08,319
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

275
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:16,186
Because I am not going to lend my name to an inferior product.
I mean, look at the diameters here.

276
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:18,378
What did you use for reduction?

277
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:19,699
Don't tell me.

278
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:21,534
Platinum dioxide, right?

279
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:24,692
No. Mercury-aluminum
amalgam.

280
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,610
The dioxide's
too hard to keep wet.

281
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,690
All right, well, you must've
done it wrong, then.

282
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:34,747
Your color is all cloudy, so you were
struggling with distillation, too.

283
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:37,476
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

284
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,958
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

285
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:41,255
What?

286
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:46,814
No way. I gave out samples, and
everyone said it was the bomb.

287
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,506
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

288
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:51,778
And who are they? I wonder.

289
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:53,826
Huh? A bunch of meth heads?
Yeah.

290
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:56,315
They should know, right?

291
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,215
Yeah, well, sorry. I can't help you.

292
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,626
Fine, asswad. You know what?
I'll contact the guy myself.

293
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:04,583
Oh, yeah? Good luck with that
because my guy is a pro,

294
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:07,215
and he doesn't deal with junkies.
You know what?

295
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,033
Eat me.
Anytime, loser. Hey. Hey!

296
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:12,638
Hey. Hey!

297
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:54,051
I can't believe
it's only 4:00.

298
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,905
This day is dragging.

299
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:39,496
Mm. I wish I could stay.

300
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,993
So stay.

301
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,060
What's stopping you?

302
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,661
What? Like everything,
you mean?

303
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:57,111
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

304
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:01,649
So move in here.

305
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,758
And then my son

306
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:07,295
hating me even more.

307
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:11,771
Nah. It'll pass. I went through that
with the girls.

308
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:12,906
They adapt.

309
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:18,047
And now everyone at work thinks I'm an evil,
ladder-climbing whore.

310
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:21,047
They're all fired
effective immediately.

311
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,293
What else?

312
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:26,821
Oh, aren't you the answer man.

313
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,378
Where did it...

314
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:38,996
Where did it go wrong,
exactly... you and Walt?

315
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,852
I mean, I always saw him
as kind of...

316
00:24:50,216 --> 00:24:51,616
mild-mannered.

317
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:55,836
Something, I don't know, change
when he got sick, or...?

318
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:00,451
I don't know what changed, Ted,

319
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:04,973
and I just don't feel really comfortable
talking about it.

320
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:06,317
Sorry.

321
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,563
Just asking
out of self-interest.

322
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:13,498
Got to make sure I don't
make the same mistake.

323
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:16,885
I would be amazed.

324
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:23,015
Just let me see if I'm
following you here, Russell.

325
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,140
You got this stuff

326
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:27,792
from some guy at Gasparza's

327
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:30,544
who was wearing tan pants

328
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,863
and who you're 80% sure had a mustache.

329
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,893
That's it, right?

330
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:39,078
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

331
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:47,718
Russell.

332
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,952
Everything all right in there?

333
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:54,100
Mel.

334
00:25:54,528 --> 00:25:56,435
The dude's name was Mel.

335
00:25:57,044 --> 00:25:58,692
Well, there you go. See?

336
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:01,310
You served
an actual earthly function.

337
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:03,333
I can't believe
I remembered that.

338
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:04,595
Mel who?

339
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:06,396
Does he have a last name?

340
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:09,317
Yeah, uh,

341
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:10,461
Mel.

342
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:12,615
Wait.

343
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:15,488
Was it Mel?

344
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:17,922
Um... Mark.

345
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,499
It was definitely an "M" name

346
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:23,560
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

347
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:25,491
Wait, wait.

348
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:29,357
Yeah.

349
00:26:30,712 --> 00:26:32,099
It's gone.

350
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,380
It's gone.

351
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:36,565
It was an "M" name, though.

352
00:26:37,118 --> 00:26:39,580
I remember the "muh" sound.

353
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:44,743
We'll go with the "muh" sound.

354
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:47,952
Thanks a lot. Yeah.
Appreciate it.

355
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:49,887
He definitely had tan pants.

356
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,410
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

357
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:59,341
Okay, it's after 9, so this bar
that Girl George is at, probably wall-to-wall

358
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:02,312
dirtbags by now. Let's go have
a little looky-loo,

359
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:05,497
see if we can't find
this M-named clown.

360
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:10,491
What?

361
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:11,776
It's a lead.

362
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:13,369
Lead to what?

363
00:27:13,404 --> 00:27:14,654
To Heisenberg.

364
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:18,415
I told you it was only a matter of
time before this guy booted up again.

365
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:19,996
Here we go, my friend.

366
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:22,721
Don't hate me
because I'm beautiful, Gomie.

367
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,256
Just apologize and buy me a beer.

368
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,462
Man, you're reaching.

369
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:31,077
This stuff could be a knockoff

370
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:33,120
or left over from an older cook.

371
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:36,060
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

372
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:39,676
How do I know?

373
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:40,911
Because I know.

374
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:43,313
I don't get it.

375
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:46,446
This is the reason
why you're blowing off the task force?

376
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:48,687
Chase down teeners?

377
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,310
I'm getting tired
of all the second guessing.

378
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:56,085
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation,

379
00:27:56,756 --> 00:27:59,330
do us both a favor
and ask for a transfer.

380
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:01,265
What is up with you lately?

381
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,530
Starting bar fights?

382
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:05,498
Turning down El Paso?

383
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,175
And now this bullshit?

384
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:10,032
Do you need to talk
to someone or what?

385
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:12,233
Talk to someone?

386
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,549
Talk to who?

387
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,717
I'm not trying to step
on your toes, bro. Okay?

388
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:25,382
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

389
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:28,050
Appreciate that... bro.

390
00:28:29,684 --> 00:28:31,984
Now take your hand
off my shoulder.

391
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:48,811
Yeah, yeah,
the one that was on TV.

392
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:51,475
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

393
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm not looking for an entire
wing here, Mr. Linkas.

394
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:57,184
It could be a nut or a bolt.

395
00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:01,588
It could be a bag of peanuts,

396
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,511
Oh, no, no, no. Closed. Uh, calling you back.

397
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:08,239
You had your chance. I told you to get him
cooking again,

398
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:11,581
and you blew it off, and now it's too late.
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

399
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:14,467
All I wanted was to show
you two your potential,

400
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,883
and what do I get in return?
A bone contusion.

401
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:19,768
You want to see the scar?
I wish you two had...

402
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,148
Hi, there.

403
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:26,276
How in the hell did you get Walt to...
I made it.

404
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:29,732
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

405
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,037
Uh, good news is,
for a stage three cancer, the guy's doing well

406
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,364
physically.

407
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,123
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

408
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:15,058
He's gone off the rails over this thing
with his wife.

409
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:20,001
My opinion,
he's not coming back, not on his own.

410
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:27,711
Your friends were
at his place again, by the way.

411
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:30,846
They drew something on the street
outside his house.

412
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,811
The scythe.

413
00:30:33,107 --> 00:30:34,219
Animals.

414
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:37,158
Does the lawyer know?
Should he?

415
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:38,240
No.

416
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:43,326
If you want this guy
to produce again,

417
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:44,824
why not just tell him?

418
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:47,615
You're the only thing that stands
between him and an ax in the head.

419
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,963
I don't believe fear to be
an effective motivator.

420
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:51,987
I want investment.

421
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:54,965
For now, I'm simply
interested in time frame.

422
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,428
He will live for the
foreseeable future, yes?

423
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:03,761
Mm, foreseeable, couple years at least,
barring acts of God and men with axes.

424
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:10,828
Oh, from the lawyer, I'm supposed to let you
know the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

425
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,085
I don't work with junkies.
That's what I thought you'd say.

426
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:16,984
Probably for the best.

427
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:19,962
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

428
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:24,396
Really?
That's what Goodman says.

429
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:26,016
Cats and dogs.

430
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,181
Do the deal.

431
00:32:57,941 --> 00:33:00,260
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

432
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,242
<i>Agent Schrader, you need to be
calling me back ASAP. Clear?</i>

433
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:07,944
<i>I've got Texas breathing down
my neck, and I'm not about...</i>

434
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,239
Yeah, I haven't see Matt

435
00:33:34,582 --> 00:33:35,952
Where can I find him, you think?

436
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:39,402
No idea. I haven't seen him...
I know. You said that a few times.

437
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,564
Yeah, because I haven't seen him.

438
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:43,303
I don't know what else to say.

439
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:49,558
What's your name, darling?

440
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,027
Cara.

441
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,592
Where did this come from, Cara?

442
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:02,273
I... I don't know.

443
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:05,579
What is it? Drugs?

444
00:34:08,865 --> 00:34:11,022
Look, I'm just going to come
right out and say it.

445
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:14,653
Um, you're a bad liar, Cara.

446
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:16,561
Don't get me wrong.

447
00:34:17,174 --> 00:34:18,935
Not the worst I've ever seen.

448
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:24,194
Once had a guy try to explain
the dope balloon up his butt

449
00:34:24,224 --> 00:34:26,551
on bad Thai food.

450
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:29,176
Still, you're not
a very good liar.

451
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,031
I honestly don't know Stop.

452
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:35,584
You look like a good kid.

453
00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:40,121
I'm not hereto get you in trouble, but you need
to tell me where this came from right now!

454
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:48,883
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

455
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:53,124
I tried it, and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

456
00:34:53,154 --> 00:34:54,595
Okay, and who gave it to you?

457
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,325
Some guy, he came in
a couple days ago

458
00:34:58,152 --> 00:35:01,823
and wanted to trade it for gas.
Some guy? W-What's his name?

459
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:04,424
Okay, w...

460
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:06,504
What did he look like?

461
00:35:08,955 --> 00:35:10,435
I don't know. Um...

462
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:12,761
He looked pretty normal.

463
00:35:13,038 --> 00:35:14,450
You know? Um, white...

464
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,767
I think his hair
was lightish brown.

465
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,256
He had really blue eyes.

466
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:27,797
They were really, really blue.

467
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:30,253
He's dreamy.
Okay, w-w-what else?

468
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,088
Piercings, jewelery,

469
00:35:32,593 --> 00:35:35,572
distinctive articles of clothing?

470
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,151
Come on.

471
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:41,187
Listen to me.

472
00:35:42,164 --> 00:35:45,882
It's real important that I find the person
that had these drugs,

473
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,577
so if you can remember
anything else about him...

474
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,606
Come on.

475
00:35:57,515 --> 00:35:59,249
He drove an RV.

476
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:01,659
Okay, good, good.

477
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:06,183
What can you remember? What kind of RV?
What color? Did you spot a license plate?

478
00:36:07,185 --> 00:36:08,946
I don't knot the kinds,

479
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,507
and I didn't see the license,

480
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:17,746
but the color was, I think,
white, brownish color.

481
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:22,290
I'm sorry.

482
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:25,557
I know I'm not helping you,
but...

483
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:40,074
Cara.

484
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:43,657
Please tell me

485
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:46,360
that that camera works.

486
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:01,762
Damn it.

487
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:00,265
Bingo.

488
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,803
These eggs are good, Mom.

489
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:25,334
Thanks.

490
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:30,229
Hey, you know what's weird?
Dad's Web site.

491
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:33,172
It's been three days
since the last donation.

492
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:36,974
Yeah, well...

493
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,757
people lose interest.

494
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:57,763
So how long are you off for?

495
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,650
A few weeks.

496
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:06,174
Uh, we'll play it by ear.

497
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:11,080
I probably...

498
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:15,205
pushed it, you know,
going back to work so soon.

499
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:28,686
Think... Think I can get a ride today?
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

500
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:33,405
Uh... yeah.

501
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:41,826
Hey, so Dad can
babysit now. Right?

502
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,186
You won't have to take
Holly to work every day.

503
00:39:56,248 --> 00:39:58,608
Sometime, maybe.

504
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:02,659
We'll see.

505
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,130
What's up?

506
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,543
I think you'll
seriously enjoy, yo.

507
00:41:09,345 --> 00:41:10,595
Wait.

508
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:14,282
No, no. No. Wait.

509
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:17,801
Hey!

510
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,129
Hey!

511
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:22,801
Hey!

512
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:26,098
What the hell?
This is only half.

513
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:28,301
That's right.
It's your half.

514
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:34,989
Where's the other half, bitch?

515
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:39,707
I mean, it was, uh...
The whole thing was crazy, man.

516
00:41:39,941 --> 00:41:44,379
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him. He actually
thought we were the cable guys, you know?

517
00:41:46,863 --> 00:41:48,874
Anyway, uh, um,

518
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:51,046
sorry about those miscalls,
Chief.

519
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:53,926
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

520
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:58,218
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?
Hell, yes!

521
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,925
With pointed boots and bells on.

522
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:02,926
Just I got this break
in the Heisenberg case.

523
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:06,029
The blue meth, you mean?
The teenth?

524
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:08,296
Yeah, well, that teenth
got things rolling.

525
00:42:08,812 --> 00:42:11,846
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
At's where I got these.

526
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:15,921
Now, the station's, uh, closed circuit,
uh, was down... surprise, surprise...

527
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:20,705
but I was able to pull some of these
snapshots off an ATM security camera.

528
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:23,957
Hey, now, I always thought these guys might be
camper cooking, right?

529
00:42:23,981 --> 00:42:26,658
First off, your typical
Class C motor home

530
00:42:26,682 --> 00:42:29,846
is going to grunt
at least 5,000 pounds of interior fixtures, okay?

531
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:33,581
5,000 pounds at least, okay?

532
00:42:34,143 --> 00:42:36,439
See how high that
suspension's riding?

533
00:42:36,897 --> 00:42:40,065
No way, no how, this thing's
carrying that kind of weight.

534
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:43,893
I mean, this thing has been cleared out
and stripped down to its tight and curlies.

535
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:45,151
For what?

536
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,235
Blood bank?

537
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:49,073
Maybe a bookmobile?

538
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:53,171
There's no clear view
of the plates.

539
00:42:53,817 --> 00:42:56,190
Yeah, well, you can only
get so lucky, right?

540
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,202
But the fact that there's
no front plate

541
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,245
tells me its likely
New Mexico registration.

542
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:01,501
I checked with DMV.

543
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:05,177
There are only 29 of these early '80s
Bounders registered in the state.

544
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,330
Only 29?
Yeah.

545
00:43:11,282 --> 00:43:13,977
So I got to go, uh,
you know, knock on some doors.

546
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:24,948
They need you in El Paso, Hank.
You bet. I... I...

547
00:43:26,087 --> 00:43:28,236
I'm just going to wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first

548
00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:31,893
So you're refusing the assignment.
No, I'm not. I'll go.

549
00:43:32,204 --> 00:43:35,393
It's just I need some more time.
You're not hearing me, Agent Schrader.

550
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:37,393
You're out of time.

551
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,080
Are you going to El Paso now?

552
00:43:41,427 --> 00:43:42,549
Tonight?

553
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:49,080
Just a simple yes or no.

554
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:57,482
No.

555
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,525
I can't.

556
00:44:03,713 --> 00:44:08,749
But that's only because
I'm really close to something big here.

557
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:21,405
Better get to it, then.

558
00:44:46,632 --> 00:44:50,101
<i>This is KECA 480,
Albuquerque news radio.</i>

559
00:44:50,132 --> 00:44:52,429
<i>KECA news time 10:13.</i>

560
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:55,039
<i>Our top story this hour, Donald Margolis,</i>

561

his role in the recent air disaster</i>

562

565

566
00:45:58,636 --> 00:45:59,879
Your half.

567
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:15,456
Okay, okay.
