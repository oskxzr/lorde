01:58.952 --> 02:00.704
Hey, guys.

02:49.044 --> 02:54.299
So if it's okay, I was thinking
about using this one for the test.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.510
Mom's brakes are very sticky...

02:56.718 --> 03:01.807
...and you barely press down on them
and it's like a screech.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.142
Sure.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.855
But I'm good?

03:08.230 --> 03:11.316
Yeah, you're great. Why?

03:12.276 --> 03:14.194
Are my feet okay?

03:19.116 --> 03:24.580
I looked it up. New Mexico says
all I need is a note from a doctor.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.332
I know it's not the right way and all...

03:27.541 --> 03:31.712
...but once I get my provisional,
I can keep working at it.

03:32.629 --> 03:36.800
Well, as long as it gets you safely
from point A to point B...

03:37.009 --> 03:39.678
...then who am I to argue?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.148
Hi.

03:51.732 --> 03:56.111
You're a sweet girl. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.365
I know.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.924
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.801
- All right.
- Thank you.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.637
- Got it?
- Yeah.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.139
Okay. All right.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.602
- So 9 a.m. Saturday?
- Yes, 9 a.m. Saturday.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.979
So which means
pick me up about 8:30?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.857
- I'll be here with bells on.
- What?

04:34.024 --> 04:37.778
It's just a saying.
Don't worry, I won't be wearing bells.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.905
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.949
- Hi. Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.535
- Could you keep an eye on your sister?
- Sure.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.994
- Thanks.
- See you, Dad.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.872
- Bye, son. Hey, good work today.
- Thank you.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.799
Have you thought anymore
about what we discussed?

04:59.800 --> 05:03.387
"Thought anymore"
meaning reconsidered? No.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.973
So show me the flaw in it.

05:06.348 --> 05:11.436
Flaws, Skyler.
Flaws. Plural, not singular.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.982
Where do you want me to start?

05:15.148 --> 05:20.153
Hey, I don't love this situation,
all right, that you put me in.

05:21.530 --> 05:24.867
However, let's just stick
with what makes sense here.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.077
You took the money
you won gambling...

05:27.286 --> 05:29.746
...invested it in the car wash
you helped run.

05:29.955 --> 05:34.334
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper,
because she's actually a bookkeeper.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.671
That is a story an auditor can believe.
What am I missing?

05:37.880 --> 05:40.674
You should just take this money
that I give you...

05:40.883 --> 05:42.968
...and not look too closely at it.

05:43.177 --> 05:47.598
So, if God forbid, I get caught...

05:47.806 --> 05:50.309
...you maintain plausible deniability.

05:50.517 --> 05:54.313
Okay, my estranged husband who,
when he was working...

05:54.521 --> 05:58.066
...made $43,000 a year,
starts shoveling money at me.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.736
And when the police come,
I'm supposed to say:

06:00.944 --> 06:04.406
"I never thought about it, officers.
Made sense to me". Really?

06:04.615 --> 06:08.118
That, in your mind,
is plausible deniability?

06:08.744 --> 06:10.037
I tell you what, Walt...

06:10.245 --> 06:13.415
...I'd rather have them think
I'm Bonnie what's-her-name...

06:13.624 --> 06:15.125
...than some complete idiot.

06:16.585 --> 06:21.673
So you're promoting caution here.

06:22.341 --> 06:26.094
And you want a believable story.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.515
That, it seems to me,
is the safest way...

06:29.723 --> 06:35.437
...to make the best
out of a very bad situation, yes.

06:36.230 --> 06:42.110
But I'm noting a little hole
in your plot though.

06:42.611 --> 06:46.281
Why would your estranged husband
be doing all this for you?

06:48.283 --> 06:53.664
Because he loves his family and
desperately wants a reconciliation...

06:53.872 --> 06:57.668
...though it may be hopeless
and futile.

06:57.876 --> 07:02.214
Then again, he'd try anything.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.137
I'm just not buying it.
No, I think it would be better...

07:09.346 --> 07:12.599
...if the husband
were no longer estranged.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.687
Yeah. Maybe if he were back
sleeping in his own bed.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.984
And suddenly a fantasy story.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.157
I am at least gonna be a part
of this household.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.869
Dinner with the family
every night of the week.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.662
Not every night, no.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.082
Six nights a week. One night off.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.626
Dinner two nights. Not weekends.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.545
With 24-hours' notice.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.630
Five nights a week, with no notice.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.966
Three. Six-hours' notice.

07:46.175 --> 07:48.844
- Five nights a week, two hours' notice.
- Four.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.055
Don't push it.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.268
- And I want my own key to the house.
- No.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.770
For emergencies and appearances,
yes.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.858
I am going to babysit my own daughter,
help my son with his homework.

08:03.066 --> 08:08.864
I am going to be a part of this family.
That is how we'll sell your little fiction.

08:33.055 --> 08:36.308
How about we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.653
No. Thanks, though.
Maybe some other time.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.113
Seriously.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.574
Get a beer with me.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.347
What?

09:23.397 --> 09:25.482
What the hell are you doing?

09:25.691 --> 09:27.901
That's ours, right?

09:28.527 --> 09:31.530
Look at it and tell me if that's ours.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.414
Yes, it's ours. Now put it away.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.001
What the hell is wrong with you?

09:44.209 --> 09:47.296
Where did you get that?
Did you take it from the lab?

09:47.838 --> 09:50.716
I bought it from the two guys
who killed Combo.

09:51.842 --> 09:54.511
They had Combo shot down
in the street...

09:54.678 --> 09:58.056
...and now it's our product
they're selling.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.560
Which means they work for our guy.
Right?

10:01.768 --> 10:05.314
What? No. What is that?
That's hearsay. Do you have any proof?

10:05.522 --> 10:09.902
I heard it from the sister
of the kid who shot him.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.614
Hear how I just said "kid"?

10:14.406 --> 10:17.826
This kid, he's 11 years old.

10:18.035 --> 10:21.038
Shot Combo on orders.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.791
These two scumbags,
they got him dealing.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.710
They got him...

10:26.919 --> 10:28.795
And you know he's not the first.

10:29.546 --> 10:34.635
They use kids because hey, why not?
Easy to control. Easy to fool.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.137
All they get is juvie
if they get caught.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.765
Hearts and minds, right?

10:39.973 --> 10:43.852
Get them young
and they're yours forever.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.605
These guys killed Combo.

10:46.813 --> 10:51.193
They used this little kid
like some puppet.

10:51.902 --> 10:56.698
They used him to shoot my friend.

11:02.204 --> 11:05.249
So why are you telling me this?

11:08.085 --> 11:10.254
I need your help.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.298
How?

11:13.465 --> 11:16.802
- I need ricin.
- Oh, my God.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.180
- Oh, my God.
- Look, these two...

11:20.389 --> 11:21.431
- Hey.
- No.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.561
Hey, they gotta go. All right?
I got the... entire thing figured out.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.771
- No.
- The delivery method, everything.

11:27.980 --> 11:31.275
All I need from you is the poison,
that's all.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.735
- No...
- Look.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.738
- Otherwise, you don't gotta lift a finger.
- No.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.157
You don't know
what you're talking about.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.369
- Not even...
- Look, you don't get how right this is?

11:42.828 --> 11:46.790
You don't get how the whole
entire world would be better off?

11:46.999 --> 11:48.542
We're not talking about this.

11:48.750 --> 11:52.379
I know a woman who buys
from these two once or twice a week.

11:52.588 --> 11:57.134
They sit in their car all day and they
get hungry, so she brings them food...

11:57.342 --> 11:59.678
...and they knock a few bucks
off her price.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.556
There's your delivery system
right there.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.975
- I could be a mile away.
- Jesus.

12:05.184 --> 12:07.853
A meth-head
you're trusting to do this?

12:08.020 --> 12:11.273
Know what? That meth-head stood up
to your brother-in-law.

12:11.481 --> 12:15.110
He questioned her for five hours.
She didn't give it up.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.822
Know how you know?
Because you're not in prison right now.

12:19.031 --> 12:21.491
Well, I know I would be in prison
after this.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.828
Prison or worse.
And I'd be right alongside you.

12:25.037 --> 12:27.831
No, Jesse, you cannot be serious.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.126
This is a ridiculous idea.

12:31.335 --> 12:35.005
It's ridiculous? What,
so you're saying it's not gonna work?

12:35.797 --> 12:40.594
How about back when it was your plan?
When we were gonna use it on Tuco.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.597
- Apples and oranges.
- Guy eats ricin...

12:43.805 --> 12:48.393
...two or three days later he gets the flu
or a heart attack and he keels over.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.980
That's what you said.
Untraceable back to us.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.441
To me.

12:55.025 --> 12:59.321
Not even that other scumbag
we work for is ever gonna figure it out.

12:59.530 --> 13:03.867
It was a good plan back when
it was Tuco, and it's a good plan now.

13:04.076 --> 13:09.414
Tuco wanted to murder us.
These guys don't.

13:09.623 --> 13:14.419
Apples and oranges. Do I really have
to sit here and explain the difference?

13:14.628 --> 13:18.715
Combo was us, man.

13:18.924 --> 13:22.302
He was one of us.
Does that mean nothing?

13:22.511 --> 13:26.723
Why didn't you go after these guys
two or three months ago?

13:26.932 --> 13:28.976
Because I just found out about them.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.644
What's to find out?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.563
It's a dispute over turf, right?

13:32.771 --> 13:37.776
I mean, how hard could it have been for
you to track them down on their turf...

13:37.985 --> 13:40.737
...and kill them months ago?

13:40.946 --> 13:46.869
Because back then, you were too busy
getting high, feeling sorry.

13:47.077 --> 13:54.126
Now, murder is not part
of your 12-step program.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.671
This is not some amends
that you have to make.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.466
What you are talking about here
is pointless.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.220
This achieves nothing.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.682
It accomplishes nothing.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.190
If you don't see
what it accomplishes...

14:16.481 --> 14:19.401
...then there's no way
I can explain it to you.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.529
Jesse, listen to me.

14:22.988 --> 14:26.116
You are not a murderer.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.661
I'm not, and you're not.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.915
It's as simple as that.

14:37.336 --> 14:39.087
Jesse.

14:40.506 --> 14:42.591
I'm doing it.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.261
With or without you.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.668
Knock, knock.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.672
Chrissakes, Marie, you don't say
"knock, knock," you... like that.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.716
- I like saying it.
- Well, that's not the rules.

15:25.551 --> 15:28.220
- Okay?
- You knock your way, I'll knock mine.

15:28.387 --> 15:30.430
But look, see? I win.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.558
Not so fast.

15:33.559 --> 15:35.769
Christ, again? That's three in a row.

15:36.395 --> 15:38.480
Got a fricking Paul Newman
over here?

15:38.689 --> 15:42.025
- Been playing cards with your dad?
- No. Why?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.237
How is your old man?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.655
Back teaching?

15:46.864 --> 15:50.117
No. I don't think
either of them are working...

15:50.325 --> 15:52.578
- ...right now.
- How they swinging that?

15:52.786 --> 15:54.621
- I don't know.
- Hey...

15:54.830 --> 15:57.541
...did you know
the doctors told your Uncle Hank...

15:57.749 --> 16:00.043
...he can get out of here
anytime he wants?

16:00.252 --> 16:02.462
Oh, yeah? That's great.

16:02.671 --> 16:06.216
- Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
- Why not?

16:06.925 --> 16:08.427
What? That's what they said.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.179
Because they want the room.

16:10.387 --> 16:13.098
They hit the sheets with Lysol,
reset the meter...

16:13.307 --> 16:17.019
...and wheel the next slob in.
We went over this, Marie. Drop it.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.481
Are you not well enough?

16:22.524 --> 16:25.819
Jesus, kid, you too?
Do I look well enough?

16:26.028 --> 16:28.739
I'm shitting in pans,
peeing in pitchers.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.617
I can't move my legs. Got it?

16:31.825 --> 16:35.162
So people in wheelchairs
should be in hospitals?

16:35.370 --> 16:40.083
What about people on crutches?
Maybe I should be in here too.

16:40.667 --> 16:45.589
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- Exactly. Deal, you little prick.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.151
Bitch.

17:07.528 --> 17:10.030
You know I'm hourly, right?

17:12.074 --> 17:14.034
He promised me
that he would be here.

17:14.243 --> 17:15.827
Oh, he promised.

17:16.036 --> 17:20.541
Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then.
That's a joke. The kid ain't coming.

17:20.749 --> 17:25.629
- Okay, so, what's plan B?
- I don't know.

17:26.296 --> 17:29.132
- I really don't.
- Well, let's brainstorm.

17:30.008 --> 17:33.512
- You really think he's serious?
- That's why I'm here, Saul.

17:33.720 --> 17:38.308
The way he was talking,
he is going to do it. Or try, at least.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.644
Okay, so we pay him off.

17:40.853 --> 17:44.565
No, no, it's not about money.
It's about getting him off the streets.

17:44.773 --> 17:47.442
Getting him to calm down.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.570
Maybe...

17:53.782 --> 17:57.119
What if we, maybe...?

17:58.871 --> 18:00.998
Could you get him arrested?

18:03.083 --> 18:06.879
You want your criminal associate
taken into police custody?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.381
No, now listen.
I know it sounds risky.

18:09.590 --> 18:13.093
But it wouldn't anything
that would get him into real trouble...

18:13.302 --> 18:16.096
...and nothing that could lead back
to our business.

18:16.305 --> 18:17.848
Just some minor offense.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.893
Pinkman in jail? I don't know.
I'm picturing it and...

18:21.101 --> 18:26.190
No, not jail as in "jail" jail.

18:26.398 --> 18:29.193
I'm talking about
one of those situations...

18:29.401 --> 18:33.572
...where you're in an orange jumpsuit
picking up litter along the highway.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.991
That's jail.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.494
You're talking about a level-two joint.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.497
Something that keeps him off the street
for 30 days.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.374
Then by the time he gets out...

18:44.583 --> 18:47.377
...tempers have cooled
and hopefully we can move on.

18:47.586 --> 18:51.465
Well, Roswell Correctional's
pretty low impact, you know.

18:51.673 --> 18:54.635
In the past,
I've recommended Springer...

18:54.801 --> 19:00.057
...but I'm hearing chancy things about
their bathrooms since they renovated.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.600
So...

19:01.808 --> 19:03.977
So it's possible, right?

19:04.186 --> 19:07.856
Well, it falls under
my Premium Services Package...

19:08.065 --> 19:12.569
...but you can afford that.
I'll call my PI.

19:16.907 --> 19:19.576
You understand what you have to do?

19:22.538 --> 19:26.375
And you can never talk to anyone,
right?

19:29.211 --> 19:31.630
I mean, ever. Understand?

19:31.797 --> 19:33.465
Yeah.

19:37.302 --> 19:40.055
I found this stuff on the Internet.

19:40.264 --> 19:42.349
Takes days to kick in.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.811
Just keep quiet
and this won't ever come back to you.

19:47.980 --> 19:50.440
You okay with this, right?

19:52.609 --> 19:55.404
Just think of it
like it's the same thing as always.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.323
You're just delivering
some hamburgers.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.079
It's not just delivering hamburgers.

20:04.288 --> 20:09.126
Hey. You got a kid, right?

20:09.334 --> 20:12.421
- What's his name?
- Patrick.

20:12.629 --> 20:17.885
All right, imagine these two guys
had Patrick working as a mule.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.970
Making him kill people.

20:20.179 --> 20:23.056
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

20:23.265 --> 20:26.226
Of course, I would.
I do all kinds of things for him.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.732
Okay, so...

20:31.940 --> 20:35.694
...these guys are using kids like that.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.740
They gotta go. Right?

20:46.121 --> 20:47.706
Good.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.798
Tomorrow.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.426
I'll be in touch.

21:18.946 --> 21:22.824
Yeah. I bet that tastes good, huh?

21:27.829 --> 21:29.623
Hey.

21:30.374 --> 21:32.334
Come here, baby.

21:33.544 --> 21:36.547
Okay. Here we go.

21:36.755 --> 21:39.091
Here we go.

21:50.853 --> 21:53.981
What are you doing?
If you need to talk, use the phone.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.276
This isn't a phone talk, Walter.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.903
Your wife's out, right?

22:03.532 --> 22:05.200
Isn't she something?

22:05.367 --> 22:08.078
I got a granddaughter
a few years older.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.831
What can I do for you?

22:12.124 --> 22:14.543
Have a seat, Walter.

22:16.545 --> 22:21.091
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
and this plan of yours.

22:25.012 --> 22:27.306
- And?
- Well, I'm not gonna do it.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.642
- Why?
- Because it's moronic.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.979
Saul said you've done things
like this before.

22:34.188 --> 22:38.108
- That's not the moronic part.
- Okay. So, what's the problem?

22:38.317 --> 22:41.320
The problem is
the boss wouldn't like it.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.448
Saul?

22:46.909 --> 22:48.952
My boss.

22:49.494 --> 22:50.746
Your boss.

22:53.790 --> 22:59.004
This is a professional courtesy.
No one knows I'm here. Understand?

22:59.213 --> 23:02.508
But our employer would find out,
like always.

23:02.716 --> 23:06.762
And if Pinkman were arrested,
he'd take it as a problem.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.598
Walt...

23:09.973 --> 23:13.227
...you got a good thing going here.
We all do.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.271
You wanna risk it all on one junkie?

23:16.480 --> 23:18.607
Now, I realise
you two have a history...

23:18.815 --> 23:23.320
...but this kid's been on the bubble
a while now. It's a long time coming.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.157
What is?

23:32.037 --> 23:35.207
I used to be a beat cop,
a long time ago.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.085
I'd get called on domestic disputes
all the time.

23:38.252 --> 23:40.504
Hundreds, probably, over the years.

23:40.712 --> 23:44.883
But there was this one guy, this one
piece of shit that I will never forget.

23:45.092 --> 23:49.096
Gordie. He looked like Bo Svenson.
You remember him?

23:49.304 --> 23:52.182
<i>- Walking Tall?</i> You don't remember?
- No.

23:52.391 --> 23:57.354
Anyway, big boy, 270, 280...

23:57.563 --> 24:01.733
...but his wife...
Or whatever she was... His lady...

24:01.942 --> 24:04.987
...was real small. Like a bird.

24:05.195 --> 24:07.781
Wrists like little branches.

24:08.991 --> 24:12.452
Anyway, my partner and I'd
get called out there... every weekend...

24:12.661 --> 24:15.122
...and one of us would
pull her aside and say:

24:15.330 --> 24:18.000
"Come on, tonight's the night
we press charges."

24:18.166 --> 24:21.253
This wasn't one of those
"deep down, he loves me" setups.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.673
We got a lot of those, but not this.
This girl was scared.

24:24.882 --> 24:28.218
She wasn't gonna cross him.
No way, no how.

24:28.427 --> 24:31.805
Nothing we could do but pass her
to the EMT's, put him a car...

24:32.014 --> 24:34.683
...drive him downtown,
throw him in a drunk tank.

24:34.850 --> 24:37.769
He sleeps it off,
next morning, out he goes.

24:37.978 --> 24:39.188
Back home.

24:40.814 --> 24:42.774
But one night...

24:43.901 --> 24:47.154
...my partner's out sick,
and it's just me.

24:47.362 --> 24:49.698
The call comes in
and it's the usual crap.

24:49.907 --> 24:52.618
Broke her nose in the shower
kind of thing.

24:52.826 --> 24:55.746
So I cuff him, put him in the car
and away we go.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.957
Only that night...

24:59.708 --> 25:01.919
...we're driving into town...

25:02.127 --> 25:07.674
...and this sideways asshole is in
my back seat humming "Danny Boy."

25:08.342 --> 25:12.221
And it just rubbed me wrong.

25:12.471 --> 25:16.141
So instead of left, I go right,
out into nowhere.

25:16.350 --> 25:20.354
And I kneel him down
and I put my revolver in his mouth...

25:20.562 --> 25:26.568
...and I told him,
"This is it. This is how it ends."

25:26.818 --> 25:29.863
And he's crying,
going to the bathroom all over himself.

25:30.072 --> 25:32.449
Swearing to God
he's gonna leave her alone.

25:32.658 --> 25:36.912
Screaming, much as you can
with a gun in your mouth.

25:37.663 --> 25:39.915
And I told him to be quiet.

25:40.123 --> 25:43.293
That I needed to think
about what I was gonna do here.

25:43.752 --> 25:46.213
And, of course, he got quiet...

25:46.713 --> 25:51.552
...goes still and real quiet.

25:52.135 --> 25:55.889
Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps.

25:56.139 --> 25:59.017
Then we just stood there for a while.

25:59.893 --> 26:02.938
Me, acting like
I'm thinking things over...

26:03.146 --> 26:07.818
...and Prince Charming kneeling
in the dirt with shit in his pants.

26:10.112 --> 26:14.032
And after a few minutes,
I took the gun out of his mouth...

26:14.533 --> 26:17.953
...and I say, "So help me,
if you ever touch her again...

26:18.161 --> 26:23.333
...I will such and such and such,
and blah, blah, blah."

26:27.296 --> 26:30.340
It was just a warning?

26:32.968 --> 26:35.220
Of course.

26:37.306 --> 26:40.309
Just trying to do the right thing.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.898
But two weeks later he killed her.

26:46.106 --> 26:48.442
Of course.

26:49.776 --> 26:53.655
Caved her head in
with the base of a Waring blender.

26:55.574 --> 26:59.912
We got there, there was so much blood,
you could taste the metal.

27:03.457 --> 27:06.126
Moral of the story is...

27:07.294 --> 27:09.963
...I chose a half measure...

27:10.380 --> 27:13.091
...when I should have
gone all the way.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.807
I'll never make that mistake again.

27:29.733 --> 27:32.819
No more half measures, Walter.

27:50.254 --> 27:52.297
Man, I don't get this.

27:52.506 --> 27:56.343
I don't get this at all.
All I'm seeing is the kid.

27:57.803 --> 27:59.721
So where are they?

27:59.930 --> 28:03.058
I don't know. They're always around.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.144
Burgers are getting cold.

28:08.605 --> 28:11.650
So is it, like, fast?

28:14.820 --> 28:17.531
Don't sweat it.
You're just doing what you do.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.409
Hey, nobody's gonna know anything.

28:21.994 --> 28:24.913
- Can I have another bump?
- Look, you had your bump.

28:25.122 --> 28:28.041
Get this thing done,
then you can have all you want.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.335
Gonna need you to come with me.

28:31.253 --> 28:33.213
Take a walk.

29:11.835 --> 29:13.754
Where we going?

30:46.430 --> 30:48.265
Sit down.

30:59.568 --> 31:03.030
I understand that you have a problem
with two of my employees.

31:03.697 --> 31:07.075
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

31:07.284 --> 31:09.661
It is possible they acted rashly.

31:10.245 --> 31:13.081
But, on the other hand,
there was provocation.

31:13.290 --> 31:15.626
The man was selling
on their territory.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.422
There is blame on both sides.

31:25.552 --> 31:27.346
This will go no further.

31:27.554 --> 31:31.934
It will be settled right here,
right now.

31:32.935 --> 31:35.062
You told him?

31:38.815 --> 31:39.816
Wait outside.

31:51.370 --> 31:56.124
Listen to me. You have one friend
in this room. This man.

31:58.126 --> 32:02.548
Those men outside
are my trusted employees.

32:02.756 --> 32:07.135
And when I learned
what you intended to do...

32:08.804 --> 32:12.558
If it wasn't for this man
and the respect I have for him...

32:12.766 --> 32:16.228
...I would be dealing with this
in a very different way.

32:16.436 --> 32:19.731
You don't look at him.
You look at me.

32:25.529 --> 32:29.408
This is what happens now.
My men will come back inside...

32:29.616 --> 32:34.121
...and you will shake their hands
and you will make peace.

32:34.329 --> 32:36.874
And that will be the... end of this.

32:40.377 --> 32:41.879
No.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.174
Jesse.

32:45.674 --> 32:49.052
- Pardon me?
- They use kids.

32:49.261 --> 32:53.015
These assholes got an 11 -year-old kid
doing their killing for them.

32:53.223 --> 32:56.435
You're supposed to be some kind
of a reasonable businessman.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.729
This how you do business?

33:00.230 --> 33:04.359
You okay with this?
You got anything to say here?

33:18.373 --> 33:20.292
Bring them back.

33:44.358 --> 33:46.235
No more children.

33:48.737 --> 33:50.531
Understand?

33:52.866 --> 33:54.326
And you...

33:58.455 --> 34:00.624
...you keep the peace.

34:05.295 --> 34:07.005
Say it.

34:08.382 --> 34:11.802
Yeah. I'll keep the peace.

34:15.055 --> 34:16.598
Shake hands.

35:00.601 --> 35:03.270
Jesse, your actions...

35:04.855 --> 35:07.733
...they affect other people.

35:10.068 --> 35:15.407
Sometimes
compromises have to be made...

35:16.950 --> 35:19.620
...for the best of reasons.

35:31.590 --> 35:34.009
Jesse. Jesse.

35:54.071 --> 35:57.783
Marie, let the people
who get paid to do this do this.

35:57.991 --> 36:01.036
The people who get paid to do this
do a lousy job.

36:13.423 --> 36:15.843
So I guess this is what you want,
huh?

36:16.051 --> 36:20.973
Just lying in a hospital bed
getting sponge baths from nurses.

36:21.181 --> 36:22.808
Marie.

36:25.435 --> 36:26.895
It's time to go home, Hank.

36:27.104 --> 36:30.774
How many times I gotta tell you, Marie?
Not till I'm well.

36:36.905 --> 36:40.075
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

36:40.284 --> 36:41.660
I'm just seeing.

36:41.827 --> 36:45.539
- Seeing what?
- Seeing what I see.

36:46.832 --> 36:50.586
- I'm not at my best here, Marie.
- We'll see.

36:51.211 --> 36:53.130
Nothing's gonna happen.

36:53.547 --> 36:54.548
I say it will.

36:54.756 --> 36:58.594
No. I'm in this bed for a reason.

37:00.304 --> 37:02.347
It's a waste of time.

37:04.308 --> 37:06.560
Besides, what if someone comes in?

37:06.768 --> 37:10.063
- I don't care if someone walks in.
- What's wrong with you?

37:11.231 --> 37:15.152
I'll tell you what. If I can get
the groundhog to see his shadow...

37:15.360 --> 37:16.862
Not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

37:17.070 --> 37:21.408
I'm betting it will.
And if he does, you check out of here.

37:23.327 --> 37:26.079
I'm not gonna bet
on whether I can get a boner.

37:26.288 --> 37:29.458
- No bet. There's no bet here. No bet.
- Afraid you'll lose?

37:29.666 --> 37:33.337
You know, you're just...
You're just being foolish, you know?

37:33.504 --> 37:36.465
Come on. What's the point?

37:36.632 --> 37:40.260
The point is
you're not completely hopeless.

37:44.056 --> 37:46.016
We have a bet?

37:47.184 --> 37:48.560
You know what?

37:48.769 --> 37:51.897
If it'll get you out of here quicker.
You got one minute.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.106
- One minute?
- Yeah.

37:53.273 --> 37:54.983
All right. That's a cakewalk.

37:55.192 --> 37:57.027
You know, this is just...

37:57.236 --> 37:59.154
This is just sad. I mean...

37:59.363 --> 38:04.368
I really feel sorry for you,
Marie, you know? I really do. It's just...

38:04.660 --> 38:07.120
- It's pathetic.
- That's good, keep talking.

38:07.329 --> 38:10.499
Protest. Struggle.

38:11.875 --> 38:14.795
Marie, give up.
I mean, seriously, it's...

38:15.671 --> 38:17.214
...not...

38:18.298 --> 38:19.299
...gonna happen.

38:44.616 --> 38:46.410
Bad day?

38:48.912 --> 38:51.290
I don't even know.

38:54.793 --> 38:56.420
Anyway...

38:56.753 --> 38:59.006
...it's better now.

39:06.054 --> 39:08.140
Tell them you're busy.

39:10.726 --> 39:12.436
Hello?

39:13.228 --> 39:14.897
Grandma?

39:15.355 --> 39:17.065
Slow down.

39:17.566 --> 39:19.610
Slow down, I can't...

39:21.320 --> 39:23.071
Oh, God.

39:23.780 --> 39:25.991
Oh, God.

39:29.661 --> 39:31.538
Oh, God.

39:59.483 --> 40:01.360
Tomas!

40:02.152 --> 40:03.779
No.

40:03.987 --> 40:07.407
You have to let me in. Please.

40:17.876 --> 40:20.838
<i>Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.</i>

40:21.588 --> 40:25.843
Jesse, you are now 42 minutes late.

40:27.594 --> 40:29.847
I'm starting without you.

40:34.268 --> 40:36.478
<i>- What is "wasabi"?
- Wasabi. Right you are.</i>

40:36.687 --> 40:38.021
<i>Four-letter word, 1200.</i>

40:38.647 --> 40:41.358
<i>Pilots and musicians
know this word derives from...</i>

40:41.567 --> 40:43.402
Dinner's almost ready, okay?

40:43.610 --> 40:45.279
Okay.

40:45.487 --> 40:48.365
<i>- What is "solo"?</i>
- This guy's good.

40:48.574 --> 40:49.825
<i>Four letter word, 2000.</i>

40:49.992 --> 40:54.413
<i>"A loud, harsh cry;
Walt Whitman's was barbaric."</i>

40:54.621 --> 40:56.582
- "Yell."
- What is "yawp"?

40:56.790 --> 40:58.000
<i>- Kevin.
- What is "yawp"?</i>

40:58.208 --> 41:00.127
<i>- Yawp.
- Tokyo, 1200.</i>

41:00.752 --> 41:04.298
- <i>This crustacean...</i>
- What the heck's a yawp?

41:04.756 --> 41:07.676
A yawp is a yell. I'll be right back.

41:07.885 --> 41:10.387
That's what I said.

41:12.764 --> 41:14.600
Okay to use your bathroom, right?

41:16.310 --> 41:17.394
Yeah, okay.

41:26.278 --> 41:29.448
<i>Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.</i>

41:40.542 --> 41:43.670
<i>Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.</i>

41:44.755 --> 41:49.801
Look, I hope you're not waiting for an
apology because I did not rat you out.

41:49.968 --> 41:53.305
I was looking out for
your best interests, as well as my own.

41:53.514 --> 41:55.682
And I stand by my decision
100 percent...

41:55.891 --> 41:59.728
...so we'll just have to agree
to disagree.

42:01.313 --> 42:04.608
Anyway, just call me back.

42:07.152 --> 42:09.446
- So the TV turns itself off, huh?
- Yeah.

42:09.655 --> 42:11.198
I'll get it.

42:11.365 --> 42:15.452
<i>- The beginning of an early cold snap.
- But first, more details on...</i>

42:15.661 --> 42:17.120
Where's the remote?

42:17.329 --> 42:19.998
<i>The murder of a young boy
in the South Valley.</i>

42:20.207 --> 42:22.376
<i>Police have yet
to release a statement...</i>

42:22.584 --> 42:25.712
<i>...but sources indicate
that 11-year-old Tomas Cantillo...</i>

42:25.921 --> 42:28.924
<i>...may have been the victim
of a gang-related execution.</i>

42:29.091 --> 42:31.802
<i>An anonymous tip brought police
to a playground...</i>

42:32.010 --> 42:35.013
<i>...in the 4700 block of Eighth Avenue
late last night.</i>

42:35.222 --> 42:39.101
<i>Paramedics were called to the scene
but were unable to revive the boy.</i>

42:39.309 --> 42:42.104
<i>- A gruesome crime...</i>
- Can you turn that off?

42:42.312 --> 42:44.690
<i>Yet another casualty
in what appears to be...</i>

42:44.898 --> 42:47.025
<i>- ...the city's ongoing struggle...</i>
- Walt?

42:47.234 --> 42:50.904
<i>...against drugs and the gangs
that peddle them. We'll be passing...</i>

42:57.202 --> 42:59.162
Hand me your dad...

42:59.621 --> 43:04.334
I'm sorry, it's just they've been talking
about that all day, and it's just...

43:04.501 --> 43:06.461
No. Yeah.

43:09.548 --> 43:12.467
Hey, did you know your Dad and I...

43:12.676 --> 43:15.554
...are thinking about
starting a business together?

43:15.762 --> 43:17.723
Seriously?

43:18.098 --> 43:20.642
What kind of business?

43:21.018 --> 43:22.895
We're thinking maybe a car wash.

43:23.103 --> 43:25.147
What do you mean? Like the...?

43:27.649 --> 43:30.027
I'm sorry, I have to go.

46:07.935 --> 46:09.061
Oh, my God.

46:28.121 --> 46:29.164
Run.
