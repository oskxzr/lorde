02:00.913 --> 02:03.414
- Good morning, officer.
- Can you turn the music down?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.208
Oh, okay.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.461
Down means off.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.674
You know why I pulled you over
this morning?

02:13.842 --> 02:15.968
Well, I'm pretty sure
I wasn't speeding.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.429
I've been using the cruise control,
so I don't...

02:18.597 --> 02:20.181
No, sir, your windshield.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.477
License and registration, please.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.522
Right.

02:31.026 --> 02:35.571
This... This was from Wayfarer 515.

02:35.739 --> 02:39.659
- My house was in the debris field.
- Okay.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.372
And that's what shattered
my windshield...

02:44.540 --> 02:47.083
...some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.418
I understand.

02:52.631 --> 02:56.884
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.470
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.056
I was one of the first responders
on the scene.

03:02.224 --> 03:05.726
- Then what are you doing?
- Citing you, sir.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.980
What? What, you don't believe me?

03:09.147 --> 03:11.440
Regardless of how that windshield
was damaged...

03:11.608 --> 03:15.736
...this car is unsafe to drive in
this condition. Stay in the car, please.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.659
Wait. Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.996
- I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.914
- Sir, listen...
- No, you listen to me.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.875
It's time for you to listen to me.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.752
- Take a deep breath, calm down.
- This is America, okay?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.755
- Get back in that car.
- I have rights. You understand that?

03:34.923 --> 03:37.717
At least have the common decency
to hear me out.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.136
- Step back now.
- Did you even hear what I said?

03:40.304 --> 03:42.430
- Sir, calm down.
- You're giving me a ticket?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.932
I told you that my house
was in the debris field.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.852
Do you have the remotest inkling
of what that means?

03:48.020 --> 03:50.897
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house...

03:51.064 --> 03:52.398
...where my children sleep!

03:52.566 --> 03:55.651
- I need you to step back now.
- There were body parts in my yard!

03:55.819 --> 03:57.778
- Are you kidding me?!
- Sir, last warning.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.906
- You got two seconds to stand down.
- Or?

04:00.073 --> 04:03.576
- I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
- Pepper-spray me. That is just perfect.

04:03.744 --> 04:07.955
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing
his opinion under the First Amendment!

04:33.315 --> 04:36.484
Lastly a little something from
down El Paso way.

04:36.652 --> 04:41.948
Border Patrol came across multiple
homicides just this side of the border.

04:42.199 --> 04:46.202
Truck turns out to be a chicken run
out of Juarez into Laredo.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.537
Border Patrol's been playing
hide-and-seek...

04:48.705 --> 04:50.498
...with these polleros for two years.

04:50.666 --> 04:53.918
But this time, soon as they made it
across, someone hit them.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.503
Hit them hard.

04:55.671 --> 04:59.173
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.676
So this truck was carrying more
than just people.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.886
What are we looking at,
weed, coke or meth?

05:04.054 --> 05:06.889
No, doesn't look like
they were transporting narcotics.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.933
Why'd the Border Patrol
kick this to us?

05:09.101 --> 05:11.060
They didn't. I pulled it.

05:11.228 --> 05:15.106
You ask me, this is high-end
cartel work. Los Zetas, maybe.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.484
Question is, why do we have
Juarez-style action...

05:18.652 --> 05:20.569
...on our side of the DMZ?

05:20.737 --> 05:23.114
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?

05:23.782 --> 05:27.118
Or was this about stopping
one particular border-hopper?

05:27.285 --> 05:31.163
Maybe one of those extra-crispies
knew something he shouldn't.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.541
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.710
All right, that's it. Slow news day.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.878
Add one more to the countdown.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.714
Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomey?

05:39.881 --> 05:42.216
We're waiting on that famous
blue meth of yours.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.052
Twenty-nine days since
we saw it last.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.097
It's still out there, Gomey.
Don't worry.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.433
Local PD. I gotta take this.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.226
Gomey, go beat your piÃ±ata.

05:52.394 --> 05:55.479
Rest of you jokers,
too damn quiet in here.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.690
Catch some bad guys.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.650
Schrader.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.861
Hey, what's up, Walt?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.613
What?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.247
Jesse?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.709
Hey, Dad.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.672
- Fixing up the house, huh?
- Doing a little work, yeah.

07:05.383 --> 07:09.470
Well, I'll bounce. It's cool.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.516
You doing okay?

07:14.309 --> 07:16.018
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

07:16.186 --> 07:20.523
I just happened to be driving by
and saw the sign.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.567
So you're selling the place.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.613
In this market. Can you believe it?

07:28.698 --> 07:31.534
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.328
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.664
We did all new stucco,
all new master suite...

07:36.832 --> 07:40.000
...sandblasted,
fumigated the basement.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.754
Right on.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.257
Yeah.

07:46.424 --> 07:50.010
You know, fixing up the place
totally increases resale value.

07:50.178 --> 07:54.306
I read that in, I wanna say,
like TIME magazine.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.061
So, what'd you do
with the upstairs bathroom?

07:59.229 --> 08:02.064
All redone. New tiles
in the bathrooms and kitchens...

08:02.232 --> 08:06.485
...granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.

08:06.820 --> 08:11.198
Damn. That's great, Dad.
Think I can get a tour?

08:11.408 --> 08:16.662
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.293
There are pictures on the website,
if you want to take a look.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.548
Cool.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.758
You're looking healthy.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.720
I'll tell your mother. She'll be happy.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.766
Thanks.

08:37.934 --> 08:43.772
You know, I could come by sometime
for dinner or something.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.860
Yeah. Sometime.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.032
Okay.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.159
Later, Dad.

09:08.215 --> 09:12.134
You know, look,
he's a high-school teacher.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.970
He's never been in trouble
a day in his life.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.097
He finds out he's got lung cancer...

09:17.265 --> 09:21.143
...and now his wife kicks
the poor bastard out of his own house.

09:21.311 --> 09:27.733
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates
a little slack, here's the guy.

09:35.033 --> 09:40.996
Hey, Walt.
Remember Officer Cavanaugh?

09:47.003 --> 09:51.090
Officer, I'm very sorry that
I lost my temper.

09:51.800 --> 09:56.929
There's no excuse for my behavior.
It was disrespectful.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.936
Yeah. Thanks, man.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.291
She's divorcing me.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.088
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.133
It is what it is.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.680
She doesn't want me to see the kids.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.852
She said that?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.730
Yeah.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.463
You don't write, you don't call.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.969
God.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.389
It's a disaster.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.352
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.562
It's not a disaster, all right?

11:28.730 --> 11:31.982
She's not going to the cops,
she's not gonna tell a living soul.

11:32.150 --> 11:37.988
You wanna know why?
One word: Blowback.

11:38.698 --> 11:43.369
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster,
for her.

11:43.536 --> 11:48.791
That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed.
You were right under his nose.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.753
He'll be lucky if they let him
bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.422
The kids? Paging Dr. Phil.

11:55.590 --> 11:59.885
My daddy's a drug dealer
and my mommy turned him in.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.598
And the house? Gone. Feds would
RICO her and the kids out on the street.

12:04.766 --> 12:09.144
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No. It's not gonna happen.

12:09.979 --> 12:14.191
She's bluffing and she knows it.

12:19.781 --> 12:24.284
Her going to the police
is not the point, Saul.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.538
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?

12:27.705 --> 12:32.626
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.

12:33.628 --> 12:37.005
Hey, buddy.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.468
- It's bad. It's a calamity.
- Oh, my God.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.847
But we live to fight another day.

12:45.014 --> 12:49.143
And after a decent interval of time...

12:49.310 --> 12:52.438
...well, there are other fish
in the sea.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.442
You've been out of circulation
for a while.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.611
You'll be just amazed at
what's out there.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.239
Thailand, the Czech Republic.

13:02.407 --> 13:07.744
I mean, those women are so grateful
to even be here.

13:09.664 --> 13:13.041
In the meantime,
idle hands are the devil's plaything.

13:13.209 --> 13:18.380
So why don't you get back on the horse
and do what you do best?

13:18.548 --> 13:22.634
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.769
I can't be the bad guy.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.898
What?

13:37.233 --> 13:40.194
I can't be the bad guy.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.825
Okay.

13:49.204 --> 13:52.456
You know, we'll revisit.

13:53.541 --> 13:59.379
Just promise me
you won't hang yourself in the closet.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.038
Pop-pop!

14:33.831 --> 14:36.792
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!

14:44.634 --> 14:48.053
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.

14:55.770 --> 14:59.940
- Yeah.
- It's me. We may have a wife problem.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.776
Look, I need eyes on it.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.988
You got an address?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.468
Hey. Dinner's gonna be late.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.264
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie
are bringing takeout...

15:33.474 --> 15:36.143
...but if you're hungry,
I could rustle something up.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.382
Hey, buddy,
pass the ketchup, will you?

16:18.645 --> 16:21.938
What? I've had enough trans-fat
for one lifetime.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.940
Two-day drive
from the nearest ocean...

16:24.108 --> 16:26.652
...and you're eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.657
Been awhile since that minnow's
been swimming. Right, buddy?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.786
Yeah.

16:36.204 --> 16:39.706
You know, Flynn here is looking
for a part-time job...

16:39.874 --> 16:42.959
...so, I don't know, if you know of
anything you might want to...

16:43.127 --> 16:45.379
My name's Walter Jr.

16:45.546 --> 16:49.716
Like, what,
you can't even say his name?

16:49.884 --> 16:53.053
If you've changed your mind
about being called Flynn...

16:53.221 --> 16:56.973
...all you need to do is just tell me
that you don't want to be called Flynn.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.518
Dad didn't even show up
till fourth period.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.688
And his eyes were all red,
like he's been crying or something.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.941
But you, you don't even care!

17:06.651 --> 17:09.486
And now he won't even
drive me home.

17:09.654 --> 17:14.032
He won't say why, but I know
it's because you told him not to.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.493
- Honey, I...
- What?

17:16.994 --> 17:19.204
I don't know what your problem is.

17:19.372 --> 17:24.334
You may not love him anymore,
but I do.

17:24.711 --> 17:29.339
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?!

17:29.507 --> 17:31.258
- Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
- Oh, God.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.761
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no. Hank. Hank, it's...

17:34.929 --> 17:37.472
It's all right.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.143
Hey, hey.

17:41.310 --> 17:47.023
Skyler, I know that you must have
your reasons for all of this.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.570
Sky, the...

17:52.363 --> 17:55.907
I know it's none of my business...

17:58.536 --> 18:00.871
...but keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...

18:06.878 --> 18:08.920
You're right, Hank.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.924
It's none of your business.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.808
Oh, my God. After all of that?

18:21.976 --> 18:24.603
Please, tell me
that you are still not curious.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.522
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.525
The day I heard the words
"second cell phone," I knew.

18:30.693 --> 18:34.029
- Believe me. Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay. All right.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.032
So, what? Stop dancing around it.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.868
What is it exactly that you have seen
a hundred times?

18:40.036 --> 18:41.620
Please, please, enlighten me.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.416
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.

18:46.584 --> 18:50.128
But, let's face it, underachiever,
dead-end life, okay?

18:50.338 --> 18:53.465
He gets cancer. Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.426
He acts up. He steps out.

18:56.594 --> 19:00.680
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.

19:00.848 --> 19:05.227
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.

19:05.394 --> 19:10.690
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty,
he probably told her himself.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.026
I... I don't know.

19:13.194 --> 19:17.781
I think if he cheated on her,
that she would have told me by now.

19:17.949 --> 19:23.119
It just feels like something more.

19:31.254 --> 19:34.464
Yes, yes, yes, 24/7 coverage.
Need you ask?

19:34.632 --> 19:36.216
How much is this gonna run me?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.387
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.014
Yeah, I'll call you.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.892
Return of the prodigal,
back to the land of the living.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.602
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

19:47.770 --> 19:51.398
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster. Am I right?

19:51.566 --> 19:56.111
Unencumbered young man
with stacks of cash.

19:56.279 --> 20:01.741
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.

20:01.909 --> 20:06.621
Speaking of cash, you know
what's giving me heartburn lately?

20:06.789 --> 20:10.834
Your former partner. This guy,
he works like a bastard, right?

20:11.002 --> 20:12.627
Builds a business single-handed.

20:12.795 --> 20:17.132
Finally the big money shows up
and what does he do? He walks out.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.470
Talent like that and he flushes
it down the crapper.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.891
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.519
Look, I know you're out of it
and all...

20:29.687 --> 20:31.980
...but you wouldn't talk to him,
would you?

20:32.148 --> 20:34.024
Help him pull his head
out of his ass?

20:35.067 --> 20:36.735
All right, all right, scratch that.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.071
Yeah, he won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.991
All due respect.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.037
You want a job?

20:47.622 --> 20:49.247
A job?

20:49.957 --> 20:53.335
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.790
There you go.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.714
Thought I'd...

24:26.882 --> 24:29.342
- ...well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.

24:29.510 --> 24:32.303
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.640
I just needed some more space
to spread out.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.642
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.

24:37.810 --> 24:43.857
Hey, girl. Hi, baby. Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay. Oh, yeah.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.359
She's a beauty. Look at her.

24:46.527 --> 24:50.738
Hey, thanks for being so flexible
on me coming in.

24:51.782 --> 24:55.994
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.959
Listen, believe me, this is...

25:03.127 --> 25:06.754
I don't want to bring this up,
but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.

25:06.922 --> 25:10.091
I'm sorry, I just can't.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.929
Is that right?

25:18.350 --> 25:22.270
If you're gonna do this,
it can't be so glaring.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.024
Glaring.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.193
Okay.

25:30.154 --> 25:34.490
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.041
Keller.

25:45.127 --> 25:49.422
Again. Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.

25:49.590 --> 25:52.217
Revenue with no backup.

25:52.968 --> 25:57.305
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.

26:05.189 --> 26:06.898
Yeah.

26:08.067 --> 26:11.694
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?

26:11.862 --> 26:16.324
How about if I just push 28,800...

26:17.284 --> 26:22.038
...out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?

26:26.543 --> 26:32.882
I'm just saying I can't sign it
as it currently exists.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.968
Fair enough.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.011
I'll take care of it.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.264
Thank you for the heads-up.

26:39.974 --> 26:42.475
You won't have to deal with this again,
I swear.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.688
What if your kids found out?

26:50.192 --> 26:55.363
- If my kids found out?
- This. What you're doing.

26:55.531 --> 27:00.076
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?

27:03.622 --> 27:06.916
Well, put me on the spot,
why don't you?

27:08.502 --> 27:10.878
I guess maybe I'd...

27:11.588 --> 27:15.008
I'd say that I might have feet of clay...

27:15.175 --> 27:17.635
...but that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

27:17.803 --> 27:21.389
You know, trying to provide.

27:21.557 --> 27:26.311
And I'd ask them to try
to take the time to understand...

27:28.480 --> 27:32.275
You know what? Truth is,
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.

27:32.443 --> 27:35.611
I'm just trying to keep my head
above water, so...

27:36.613 --> 27:38.781
I'd better get back to it.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.667
Oh, God.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.212
Hi, Walt.

27:53.380 --> 27:57.050
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...

27:57.217 --> 27:58.718
What?

27:58.886 --> 28:01.804
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

28:01.972 --> 28:03.056
No, no, no, of course.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.767
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.604
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.

28:11.065 --> 28:12.982
Well, yeah. It is rush hour.

28:13.150 --> 28:16.652
I mean, I could fight traffic
and bring him down to Beneke now.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.155
But wouldn't it be easier if we...?

28:20.074 --> 28:23.701
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.870
Okay, bye.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.331
Why are you doing this?

28:28.499 --> 28:33.753
She's just trying to keep me from
seeing you and you're helping her.

28:33.921 --> 28:40.468
Well, son, I mean, your mother,
she has her reasons.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.637
What reasons?

28:44.932 --> 28:46.849
They're...

28:47.434 --> 28:49.811
Well, they're...

28:51.605 --> 28:54.690
Well, they're just a little difficult
to delineate.

28:54.858 --> 29:01.072
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides
to every story, always.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.534
But she...

29:06.578 --> 29:08.121
Yeah.

29:09.873 --> 29:14.794
This is just how it has to be
for now, okay?

29:14.962 --> 29:19.757
Now, look, your home is your home
and that is where you belong, all right?

29:19.925 --> 29:24.220
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.180
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie...

29:26.348 --> 29:30.268
...everybody knows
that you haven't done anything wrong.

29:30.644 --> 29:34.188
Everybody is on your side.

29:37.443 --> 29:42.864
Well, it's not about taking sides,
though.

29:43.031 --> 29:46.742
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.

29:46.910 --> 29:51.247
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?

29:51.415 --> 29:55.626
No matter what, all of this has nothing
to do with how we feel about you, okay?

29:55.794 --> 29:59.797
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

29:59.965 --> 30:04.093
You and your sister will
come first always.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.722
Come on.

30:11.894 --> 30:16.063
Let's try to see this
in a positive light, okay? Both of us.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.442
Let's just buck up.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.945
And I'll take you home.

30:26.825 --> 30:31.704
Let me first just
hit the old bathroom here.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.599
Hello. Good afternoon.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.227
- Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman.
- Nice to meet you.

30:54.394 --> 30:58.064
You're not that lawyer
on late-night television, are you?

30:58.232 --> 31:00.441
Better call Saul!

31:02.110 --> 31:03.569
I get it all the time.

31:04.321 --> 31:08.241
We're here to discuss the sale of
the property at 9809 Margo.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.827
I get it. Flat-fee clients, am I right?

31:11.995 --> 31:14.747
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

31:14.915 --> 31:18.543
I represent a client
who shall remain nameless.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.253
However, for our purposes...

31:20.420 --> 31:23.798
...you might just as well visualize
a large bag of money.

31:23.966 --> 31:28.261
This individual wants
to buy your house today for cash.

31:28.428 --> 31:31.222
- Cash?
- Cash. I know, in this economy.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.225
The money is already burning a hole
in my client's account.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.728
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown
him all the pertinent financials.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.439
It's the only reason
we're sitting here.

31:41.066 --> 31:44.735
Fair enough. We get a few papers
signed and notarized...

31:44.903 --> 31:46.737
...we can take care of this right now.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.782
In fact, I could wire you your money
this very afternoon.

31:50.242 --> 31:53.578
There's just one little hair
in the soup.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.788
The price.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.545
We feel 875 is very fair.

32:02.713 --> 32:06.007
But I suppose there's always
a little wiggle room.

32:06.383 --> 32:12.263
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down
to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?

32:12.889 --> 32:16.225
Four hundred thousand?
What is that, a joke?

32:16.393 --> 32:18.436
No, that's my offer.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.855
That's less than half-price.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.107
We put that much
into the renovations alone.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.067
Why don't we just cut
the clown act...

32:25.235 --> 32:28.321
...and you tell us what you're willing
to come up to?

32:28.488 --> 32:31.157
Four hundred thousand.
That's my final offer.

32:31.325 --> 32:32.658
- Waste of time.
- Ridiculous.

32:32.826 --> 32:35.286
How could you possibly imagine
we'd entertain this?

32:35.454 --> 32:36.829
- Come on, hon.
- I don't know.

32:36.997 --> 32:40.333
I thought some allowance was in order
once I heard about the meth lab.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.043
That used to be in the basement.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.296
I looked over your signed disclosure
statements...

32:45.464 --> 32:47.923
...and I don't see any mention
of a meth lab. Nope.

32:48.091 --> 32:51.385
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.

32:51.553 --> 32:52.970
But no meth lab.

32:53.138 --> 32:58.684
Now, some would call that fraud
in service of concealing a felony.

32:58.852 --> 33:04.231
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.692
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.569
I mean, good try...

33:08.737 --> 33:12.073
...at sneaking a meth-contaminated
property past a buyer.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.868
I mean, could've been a good deal
for you. Too bad.

33:16.036 --> 33:21.499
Now, I could file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.918
Or I could start some criminal
proceedings.

33:24.086 --> 33:27.213
But I don't think any of us want that,
now, do we?

33:27.381 --> 33:30.883
How about it, counselor?
Do you concur?

33:52.739 --> 33:53.781
There you go, son.

33:55.325 --> 33:58.577
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.168
Okay.

34:16.096 --> 34:18.723
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

34:23.770 --> 34:27.523
- Brought pizza.
- Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.

34:28.108 --> 34:33.279
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.

34:36.658 --> 34:37.700
Hi, honey.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.330
Sorry.

34:47.502 --> 34:48.919
Skyler.

34:51.131 --> 34:55.009
I mean, what kind of example do
we want to set here, right?

34:55.177 --> 34:59.430
I mean, can't we at least just sit down
and eat a piece of pizza together?

34:59.598 --> 35:02.475
Just hash things out like adults?

35:04.144 --> 35:08.314
We have discussed everything
we need to discuss.

35:08.482 --> 35:11.400
I thought I made myself very clear.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.323
I got dipping sticks.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.490
You've reached Walt's
temporary number.

36:41.658 --> 36:43.492
Please, leave a message.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.748
When I went out this morning
to get the newspaper...

36:49.916 --> 36:52.960
...I saw a pizza on our roof.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.796
Would you know anything about that?

36:55.964 --> 36:59.258
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.

36:59.426 --> 37:04.221
Calm down, accept the situation
and keep your distance.

37:04.389 --> 37:09.101
If you can't manage that,
I will get a restraining order.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.403
Skyler. Skyler.

37:20.572 --> 37:24.533
Got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!

37:39.466 --> 37:41.300
Breaking even is not so bad.

37:41.468 --> 37:44.553
In this economy, a lot of people
would kill to break even.

37:44.721 --> 37:50.601
Poor Jake. He had his heart set
on going to Space Camp.

37:52.562 --> 37:53.854
Oh, no.

37:54.022 --> 37:57.691
Oh, God. This is all we need.

37:58.818 --> 38:02.988
Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going?

38:03.782 --> 38:07.242
Jesse, it's really not a good time.

38:07.869 --> 38:08.911
Come on.

38:09.079 --> 38:12.039
Jesse, the house has been sold.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.208
The new owners are expected
at any moment.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.877
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.798
I bought the place.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.022
Be back by seven, okay?

38:37.315 --> 38:39.024
Love you.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.323
Bye.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.183
No!

42:00.894 --> 42:01.935
Oh, God.

43:54.132 --> 43:56.633
It's me. There's something
he should know about.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.387
Hold on.
