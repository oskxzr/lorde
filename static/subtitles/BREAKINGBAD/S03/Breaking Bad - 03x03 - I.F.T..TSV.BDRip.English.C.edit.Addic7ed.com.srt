2
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:14,103
More.

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,154
Another.

4
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:27,746
Careful, señor.

5
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:30,287
Hot day like today...

6
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,622
...too much oil in the machine...

7
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,334
...can cause it to blow a gasket.

8
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:40,380
There are two kinds of men
in this world.

9
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:42,213
Those who drink...

10
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:44,300
...and those who pour.

11
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:47,476
Shut up and fill my glass.

12
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:59,903
Hey, you two.

13
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:01,523
Yes, you.

14
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,285
I used to be just like you.

15
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,824
Worked dirt for the man
till my hands bled.

16
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,698
But no more.

17
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:14,331
Because I learned that a man
can never drink his fill...

18
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:16,582
...by waiting in line for the tap.

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,331
Listen to him.

20
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:21,261
He can teach you something!

21
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:26,929
Hey, how you doing, boss?

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,104
Good to see you, my friend.

23
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:37,480
You know, I never pegged you
for such a deep thinker.

24
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:39,771
I keep thinking I should write a book.

25
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,022
Maybe, maybe...

26
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,286
So, what brings you to this
burro's asshole of a town?

27
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:51,745
I knew I would find you here.

28
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:56,702
Don't you have something to deliver?

29
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,874
Cutting it close, aren't you?

30
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,630
Lots of time.

31
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:08,129
Tortuga may be slow out of the gate,
but he always...

32
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:09,593
Finishes first.

33
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:12,056
Yes, I know.
Just like your namesake.

34
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:15,561
I like the way you talk, Tortuga.

35
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,474
Yeah?

36
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:20,140
You've got such a way with words.

37
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:24,518
They flow like a waterfall.

38
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:26,401
I like that about you.

39
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:36,616
I'm so stupid.
I missed your birthday.

40
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:38,751
No, I feel terrible.

41
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,454
So bad I came all the way here
to this burro's asshole...

42
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:44,250
...to give you your present.

43
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:45,497
Present?

44
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:48,593
Come on, boss.
No need to go through the trouble.

45
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:51,010
Forget it, I wanted to.

46
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:54,099
I have it for you in the back.

47
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,011
- Back there?
- Yes. Come. Follow me.

48
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,118
It's perfect!

49
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,038
Do you really like it?

50
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:20,998
I love it!

51
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,374
What a great pet it will make.

52
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:24,915
Thank you, boss!

53
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,505
Excellent.

54
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,129
Let me sign it for you.

55
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:30,832
Let me sign it...

56
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:38,048
..."For the big talker."

57
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:40,191
He's still breathing.

58
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:43,910
Well, by the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

59
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,914
I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

60
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,125
Mum's the word.

61
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,205
Son of a bitch.

62
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,432
Hang on, baby.

63
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,613
<i>Hello.</i>

64
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,733
Walt? Are you in the house?

65
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,285
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.

66
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,661
What? What the hell
are you doing in there?

67
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,372
I'm back.

68
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,165
No, no, you're not back, Walt.

69
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,090
You're not back.
Get... Get out of there.

70
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,499
- Well, it's my house too, Skyler.
- No...

71
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,594
I'm staying. End of story.

72
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,180
- We had an agreement.
- I didn't agree to anything.

73
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,516
Now, look, just come on inside
and we'll talk this through, okay?

74
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,603
No. No. There's nothing to talk about.

75
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:43,233
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

76
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:47,859
Well, suit yourself.

77
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,734
Walt.

78
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,402
Walt?

79
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,591
What is wrong with you?

80
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:23,181
- Skyler, I have... every right to be here.
- No, you don't.

81
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:26,642
You don't live here anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

82
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:29,523
- I don't agree to a divorce.
- Well, it's not up to you.

83
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,900
If you don't get out of here right now,
I'm gonna call the police...

84
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:39,695
...and I'm going to tell them
everything.

85
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:42,541
I mean it, Walt.

86
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:47,668
There's the phone.

87
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:07,849
It's ringing.

88
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,070
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.</i>

89
00:08:14,238 --> 00:08:17,488
<i>Operator number 314.
How may I help you?</i>

90
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:22,658
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.
How may I help you?</i>

91
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,499
Yes, I want to report a disturbance,
please.

92
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,540
No, no, it's not...
It's not exactly, it's...

93
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:36,419
It's a domestic issue.

94
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,546
Okay.

95
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:43,724
They're connecting me.

96
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:48,258
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

97
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:50,975
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

98
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:55,523
This family is everything to me.

99
00:08:55,778 --> 00:09:00,404
- Without it, I have nothing to lose.
- Fine.

100
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,699
Yes. My name is Skyler White.

101
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:08,872
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

102
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,710
My soon-to-be... ex-husband
broke into my house...

103
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,497
...and I need an officer to come
and remove him.

104
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:23,503
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

105
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,715
Okay. Okay.

106
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:32,555
Thank you.

107
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:39,978
They're coming.

108
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:31,159
- Dad's here?
- Great, he's home.

109
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:33,485
- Dad.
- Hey, son.

110
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,407
How are you?

111
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:38,584
Are you back for good?

112
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:43,413
- Why are you home so soon?
- I'm not.

113
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:47,550
Hey, I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

114
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:48,998
- Sure.
- You want one too?

115
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:52,344
Walter, your dad and I
have something we need to discuss.

116
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:56,013
When your sandwich is ready,
I'll bring it to your room.

117
00:10:56,226 --> 00:11:01,351
Mom, can't it wait?
I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever.

118
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:03,065
- Walter?
- How was school?

119
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:05,024
- It was good.
- Yeah? Homework?

120
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:08,443
- No, not really.
- Not really? What does that mean?

121
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:20,619
So are you gonna be
at work tomorrow?

122
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,033
Yeah, that's the plan.

123
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:39,632
Hello, ma'am.
We were called about a disturbance?

124
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:44,020
It's more of a trespassing situation,
really, but...

125
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:46,642
Yeah, that was me.

126
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:51,273
You called the cops on Dad?

127
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,233
I came home from work
and he was back.

128
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,735
He had just moved back
into the house.

129
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:07,164
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen. I just...

130
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:11,244
I want him out.
I want him out of the house.

131
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:14,874
Okay, Mrs. White, there's a couple
questions I need to ask you.

132
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,925
It's very important
you answer honestly.

133
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,054
- Did he strike you?
- No.

134
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:24,386
- Has he... ever hit you?
- No. This is not about violence.

135
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,718
This is about trespassing.

136
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:31,688
- About him being here against my will.
- Okay. Trespassing.

137
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:35,477
- You're divorced, then?
- No, working on it.

138
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,316
- Right now, were separated.
- Legally separated?

139
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,946
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean.

140
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:45,986
But we've been living apart
for almost two weeks, give or take.

141
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:49,746
I changed the locks.
Isn't that breaking and entering?

142
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:51,791
Whose name is on the title
to the house?

143
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:55,294
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

144
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:58,038
We can't arrest a man for breaking
into his own house.

145
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,708
Not without a court order
requiring he stays away.

146
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:02,795
Unless he's threatened you
or the kids.

147
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:08,926
No. Not physically.
But having him in the house is just...

148
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:14,015
It's not a good thing. Excuse me.

149
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:20,650
I got her, honey.
Come here. Here we go.

150
00:13:20,822 --> 00:13:25,448
You hungry? You hungry?
Here we go.

151
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,025
That was it.

152
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,744
- I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?
- Disagreements.

153
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:36,582
Yes, well, we've had our share of that.

154
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:42,124
I haven't... I haven't been
the most attentive husband lately.

155
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:49,090
Mrs. White, would this be... easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

156
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:58,774
No. Nope. I'm fine right here.

157
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:00,484
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

158
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:03,356
If you want him out of the house,
you'll have to help me.

159
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:07,114
Is it possible maybe
he's broken any laws that you know of?

160
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:11,530
Anything at all. Anything that
we could work with here, just tell me.

161
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:14,242
Even if it's just a suspicion,
I can work with that.

162
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:16,656
I'll get him out of the house for you.

163
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,874
What's your take on all this?

164
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:21,879
It's my mom's fault.

165
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:29,675
She won't even say what my dad did
and it's because he didn't do anything.

166
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:32,337
I don't know why
she's being this way.

167
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:37,806
My dad, he is a great guy.

168
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:41,727
Son, it's not your mom's fault.

169
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,976
Mrs. White.

170
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:49,477
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no legal basis...

171
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,444
...for us to remove your husband
from the house.

172
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:56,573
Next time you feel things
are getting out of control...

173
00:14:56,747 --> 00:15:00,281
...you should call this number.
It's the family hotline.

174
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,747
I'd really look into
some counseling.

175
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,963
Best of luck to you folks.

176
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,800
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

177
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,428
Why you gotta...?
Why you gotta do this to Dad?

178
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:23,646
Junior, wait, come on.
Don't blame your mother for this.

179
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,652
Sorry.

180
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,912
Welcome home.

181
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:35,996
He lives. Happy housewarming, kid.

182
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:38,547
- Don't look so glad to see me.
- Thanks.

183
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:42,594
Interesting decor. It's subtle.

184
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:46,098
The whole minimalist thing never
really blew my hair back, but hey.

185
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:51,805
So how are you doing?
Staying clean?

186
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:56,691
Good. I was kind of worried
that you were back to old habits...

187
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:59,103
...since I didn't hear from you,
you know.

188
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,697
You realize how stupid it is
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

189
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,527
What if I was trying to warn you...

190
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:08,153
...that the DEA was gonna kick down
your door? What then?

191
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,414
Why don't you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

192
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,706
Fair enough.
Remember the other day...

193
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:17,875
...when I brought up the idea of you
getting back in touch with your partner?

194
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:20,503
Well, I kind of wanted to
re-float that boat.

195
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:23,249
I'm not suggesting you
yourself get back to cooking.

196
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:25,255
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

197
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,130
I only want you to convince
the master chef to do his thing.

198
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:32,345
So, what do you say?

199
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:35,808
- Sure, man. Whatever.
- Okay. Whatever what?

200
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:38,437
I mean, you gonna call him?

201
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:42,772
I said I'll handle it.
Now, bounce, will you? Please?

202
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:44,820
Final thought.

203
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:49,781
Look at this place. You're house-poor,
you got no bankroll.

204
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:54,200
If you get the maestro cooking again,
I'll make it worth your while.

205
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,782
Call him.

206
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:46,707
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

207
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:47,962
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

208
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:50,707
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

209
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:15,033
Schrader.

210
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,526
Yes, sir. Yeah, what's up?

211
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:21,206
Yeah?

212
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:27,451
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

213
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:31,089
Yeah, yeah, absolutely,
you can bet on that.

214
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:33,091
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir...

215
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,593
...I really appreciate you stepping
to the plate. Thank you.

216
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,100
So you gonna keep me in suspense
or what? What's the good news?

217
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:47,563
Merkert called in a couple of favors.
El Paso wants me back.

218
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:50,899
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

219
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:52,527
Thank you.

220
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,272
Hello.

221
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:10,784
Gentlemen. Welcome.

222
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:13,113
Thank you for coming.

223
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:15,661
Any difficulty at the border?

224
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:19,165
The day I can't get across the border
is the day I retire.

225
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:22,038
Please, come in.

226
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:25,961
I apologize that it's not
wheelchair accessible.

227
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:38,931
My apologies, Gustavo.

228
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,394
Of course,
you should have been advised.

229
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:45,685
It's your territory,
you had a right to bless the order.

230
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,140
But...

231
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,269
We had no reason to believe
the man was of concern to you.

232
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,946
Indeed, he is.

233
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,329
So you're in business with
this Heisenberg.

234
00:22:57,746 --> 00:23:00,202
I don't know him by that name, but yes.

235
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:02,366
I've made no secret of the fact that...

236
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:06,872
...I have always done business
with certain local manufacturers.

237
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,756
You and I,
we still make money together.

238
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:17,007
It's never affected our relationship.

239
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:21,511
Don Salamanca had a
nephew named Tuco.

240
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:24,135
Yes, I knew of him.

241
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:28,436
Then perhaps you know Don Salamanca
mentored him in the business.

242
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:31,731
Thought of Tuco as a son.

243
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:37,147
When Don Salamanca was no longer
able, Tuco took over for his uncle.

244
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:40,534
He was a key man in our
organization north of the border.

245
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:42,871
He was loyal.

246
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:45,699
This Heisenberg, Walter White...

247
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,450
...he was one of Tuco's local suppliers.

248
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:50,752
Until he betrayed Tuco.

249
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:56,127
So now you see,
blood must be repaid by blood.

250
00:23:57,345 --> 00:23:59,053
Tuco's cousins here...

251
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,929
...they have the right
to exact vengeance.

252
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,714
The Salamanca family, the cartel...

253
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,810
...everyone stands shoulder
to shoulder on this.

254
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:10,846
Don Salamanca.

255
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,025
Gentlemen.

256
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:15,518
I feel your loss deeply.

257
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,273
Please accept my condolences.

258
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:25,743
I have no issue with
your right to vengeance.

259
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:31,704
But I am presently engaged in
business with this man.

260
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:35,088
When our business is done...

261
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:40,126
...he will no longer be
of any concern to me.

262
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:43,882
Until then...

263
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:49,132
...I need him alive.

264
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:56,898
Excuse us.

265
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:14,954
I don't tell you how to
fry your chickens, Gustavo.

266
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:18,668
You should really leave matters
of my organization's politics to me.

267
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:22,249
Do I not run my own territory?

268
00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:23,836
Of course you do.

269
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:26,052
And I will advise them to be patient.

270
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:29,554
But I recommend you finish your
business with the man quickly.

271
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:32,554
Or you risk losing the
good graces of the cartel.

272
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:34,852
That would not be wise.

273
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:40,431
And those boys inside...

274
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:43,227
...I cannot guarantee
that they will listen.

275
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,865
They are not like you and I.

276
00:26:11,597 --> 00:26:14,801
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

277
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:16,007
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

278
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:18,641
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

279
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:33,402
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

280
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:34,608
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

281
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:37,491
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

282
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,835
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you...</i>

283
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:27,874
Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

284
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:32,422
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

285
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:37,882
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.
Mama's got you.

286
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:43,633
I've got you. Yes. Yes.

287
00:27:45,937 --> 00:27:48,345
Skyler? Want some help?

288
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:02,652
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

289
00:28:15,757 --> 00:28:17,382
God...

290
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,433
- What do you mean? Against your will?
- Yes.

291
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:42,361
Very much against my will.
He just... He showed right back up.

292
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:46,661
And he doesn't want a divorce.
Won't even consider it.

293
00:28:47,162 --> 00:28:50,780
I called the police on him.

294
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:53,330
I was so clo...

295
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:57,878
- So close to what?
- Nothing. Never mind.

296
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:03,467
Skyler, I can't advise you properly
if you don't give me all the facts.

297
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:07,007
Understand, I'm bound
by the attorney-client privilege...

298
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,340
...to keep everything you tell me
a secret.

299
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:12,802
I can't tell a soul
unless you authorize me to.

300
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,595
Even if it's something illegal?

301
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,479
Especially if it's illegal.

302
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:23,229
I'm your lawyer, not the police.
My job is to protect you.

303
00:29:32,747 --> 00:29:35,321
My husband makes meth.

304
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:39,458
Methamphetamine.

305
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,459
- Your husband's a drug dealer?
- A manufacturer, technically.

306
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:50,629
They... They call them cooks.

307
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:53,139
I looked it up on the Internet.

308
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:57,177
This is my advice,
and you should take it:

309
00:29:57,354 --> 00:30:00,106
Sue your husband for divorce
immediately.

310
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:03,856
Let me go to the police
and tell them what you just told me.

311
00:30:04,027 --> 00:30:07,478
I'll go in ex parte to get a
restraining order from the court today.

312
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:11,274
If he comes anywhere near you and
your children, he'll go straight to jail.

313
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:14,156
No questions asked.
This is a no-brainer.

314
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:17,448
It's the best thing for you
and your family.

315
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:21,577
I can't.

316
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,286
I can't do it.

317
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:32,297
I don't want my son to find out
that his father is a criminal.

318
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:34,964
I just...

319
00:30:35,182 --> 00:30:40,686
- I can't do that to him.
- In the... end, it may not be up to you.

320
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:43,727
Drug dealers have a way
of getting caught.

321
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:48,892
Walt has lung cancer.

322
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:51,647
His treatment bought him some time.

323
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:54,989
But the doctors,
they all say that sooner or later...

324
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,701
I can't see why
I should lay all this on my family...

325
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:04,039
...when things may...

326
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:10,124
...resolve themselves on their own...

327
00:31:10,757 --> 00:31:14,707
...without anyone... else knowing.

328
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:23,180
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

329
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:27,522
- What are we doing in this shithole?
- Relax, will you?

330
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,015
Relax? This is the kind of place
you get knifed.

331
00:31:30,193 --> 00:31:33,644
- We should have went to Chili's, man.
- All right, already. Jesus.

332
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:38,233
Outback Steakhouse. It's not too late.
They got that Blooming Onion.

333
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:40,817
What's wrong with spicing things
up a little?

334
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:45,039
This spice looks like it's been through
a couple of guys already.

335
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:48,418
So when you headed back down
to El Paso?

336
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:52,838
You know. Between all the packing,
errands, getting the ducks in a row...

337
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:56,457
- ...maybe a week or two.
- Week or two?

338
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:59,125
Come on, man.
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

339
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:01,545
It's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

340
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:03,051
What are you talking about?

341
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:07,304
Ain't jack going on up here.
It's quiet as hell.

342
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:09,936
I'm gonna hit the head.

343
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:46,006
Those two over there.
I think they're holding.

344
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,219
Man, in this place,
the bartender's probably holding.

345
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:57,726
- All right.
- What you doing?

346
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:59,609
Calling A.P.D., what do you think?

347
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,020
Since when can't we handle
a couple dirtballs?

348
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:03,607
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

349
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,439
What if Vice is running
some kind of undercover op?

350
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:13,663
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.

351
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:50,532
- Where you going?
- Gotta take a leak.

352
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:53,239
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

353
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:06,042
Stand up.

354
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:17,300
You got a problem with us, bitch?

355
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:19,470
Your move.

356
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:49,336
DEA. Don't move.

357
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,681
Go out and tell my partner
to get his ass in here.

358
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:36,711
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

359
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:37,917
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

360
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,467
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

361
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,186
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:</i>

362
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,022
<i>"Do Not Call..."</i>

363
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:13,159
<i>The number you have reached,
149-4985...</i>

364
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:17,121
<i>...in area code 505 is no longer...</i>

365
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,268
Skyler.

366
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:02,729
Can we talk?

367
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:20,370
ASAC wants to see you.

368
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,752
And?

369
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,327
We were hanging back,
saw a deal go down.

370
00:38:26,506 --> 00:38:28,249
I went outside to call it in.

371
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:30,417
You stayed to keep an eye
on the suspects.

372
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:32,799
That's when they attacked you.

373
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:42,059
What I didn't tell him is that
you left your gun under the seat...

374
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:44,898
...before you went back inside.

375
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:05,829
I've done a terrible thing.
But I did it for a good reason.

376
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:09,787
I did it for us.

377
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,676
That is college tuition
for Walter Jr...

378
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:22,057
...and Holly 18 years
down the road.

379
00:39:25,186 --> 00:39:28,353
That is health insurance
for you and the kids.

380
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:35,312
For Junior's physical therapy,
his SAT tutor.

381
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:39,189
It's money for groceries...

382
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:42,242
...for gas...

383
00:39:42,745 --> 00:39:47,407
...for birthdays
and graduation parties.

384
00:39:50,627 --> 00:39:54,577
Skyler, that money is for this roof
over your head...

385
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:57,247
...the mortgage you aren't
gonna be able to afford...

386
00:39:57,425 --> 00:40:00,177
...on a part-time bookkeeper's salary
when I'm gone.

387
00:40:00,345 --> 00:40:04,212
- Walt, I...
- Please. Please.

388
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,147
This money, I didn't steal it.

389
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:17,234
It doesn't belong to anyone... else.

390
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,481
I earned it.

391
00:40:21,156 --> 00:40:25,652
The things I've done to earn it...

392
00:40:33,293 --> 00:40:37,373
...the things that I've had to do...

393
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:42,710
...I've got to live with them.

394
00:40:48,808 --> 00:40:50,385
Skyler...

395
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,685
...all that I've done...

396
00:40:55,856 --> 00:41:01,312
...all the sacrifices that I have
made for this family...

397
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:07,441
...all of it will be for nothing
if you don't accept what I've... earned.

398
00:41:08,702 --> 00:41:10,445
Please.

399
00:41:14,624 --> 00:41:17,459
I'll be here
when you get home from work.

400
00:41:19,587 --> 00:41:22,043
You can give me your answer then.

401
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,979
Hey, Sky.

402
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:48,871
- Hey, some coffee?
- Yeah.

403
00:42:49,464 --> 00:42:53,296
That report's looking real good.
I like how it looks.

404
00:42:53,468 --> 00:42:55,010
Good.

405
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:05,427
Are your kids home?

406
00:43:45,768 --> 00:43:49,267
<i>It's here! It's here!
Everybody, come on in! Look!</i>

407
00:43:51,273 --> 00:43:53,313
Hey, Mrs. White.

408
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:56,308
Hey, Louis.

409
00:43:56,486 --> 00:43:59,571
Hey, thanks for having me
over for dinner.

410
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:01,939
Sure.

411
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:07,656
Hey, Skyler. I'm cooking dinner.

412
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:12,659
Pot roast. Could you...?

413
00:44:31,812 --> 00:44:34,978
So how was your day?

414
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:39,394
- Good.
- Good.

415
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:40,600
Excellent.

416
00:44:41,154 --> 00:44:46,231
I hope you don't mind, I invited Louis
to stay for dinner tonight.

417
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:50,822
You know, as a thank-you for driving
Walter Jr. To school for us.

418
00:44:51,247 --> 00:44:53,916
We've been kind of absent...

419
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:58,875
...but, I tell you,
Louis really pitched in.

420
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:09,926
Look, I just wanna say that I feel good
about our talk this morning...

421
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:13,549
...and I'm very eager
to hear what you're thinking about...

422
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:15,636
...about what we talked about.

423
00:45:15,812 --> 00:45:18,564
But, you know,
whenever you're ready, of course.

424
00:45:24,904 --> 00:45:30,064
Honesty is good. Don't you think?

425
00:45:52,722 --> 00:45:54,880
I fucked Ted.

426
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:05,980
Boys, dinner.

427
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:09,696
- Iced tea?
- Yeah.

428
00:46:09,863 --> 00:46:11,239
- Okay.
- Thank you.

429
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:12,817
- Louis?
- Yes, please.

430
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,534
All right.

431
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,455
I want you boys both
to eat your salad, okay?

432
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:23,751
- Okay.
- I know nobody likes salad...

433
00:46:24,294 --> 00:46:25,669
...but it's good for you.

434
00:46:25,837 --> 00:46:27,830
- Thanks, darling.
- Thank you.
