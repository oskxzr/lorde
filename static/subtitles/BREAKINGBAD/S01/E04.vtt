Operation Icebreaker.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.637
How we liking that? We never
used that before, did we?

00:12.805 --> 00:14.245
Isn't that the name
of a breath mint?

00:14.390 --> 00:15.556
What?
Ice Breakers, right?

00:15.724 --> 00:18.059
- Breath mint?
- Nobody's gonna think that.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.519
Gonna be thinking about
some big-ass ship

00:19.687 --> 00:21.062
in the North Pole breaking ice.

00:21.230 --> 00:24.232
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
Operation Breath Mint.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.817
I'm thinking
Operation Breath Mint

00:25.984 --> 00:28.344
every time you and me are on a
stakeout together, all right?

00:28.404 --> 00:31.239
Your breath can knock a buzzard
off a shit wagon.

00:31.407 --> 00:35.618
All right, Operation TBD.

00:35.786 --> 00:36.911
Thanks for nothing, Gom.

00:37.079 --> 00:41.499
Anyway, say hello to
Domingo Gallardo Molina.

00:41.667 --> 00:45.753
A.k.a. Krazy-8. Way smarter
than your average cheese eater.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.380
I turned him out
when he was street level,

00:47.548 --> 00:49.257
but this dude's
like The Jeffersons,

00:49.425 --> 00:50.425
moving on up.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.968
Every small-time dealer
he'd throw at us,

00:52.136 --> 00:53.720
he'd end up snaking
all their customers.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.431
Now it turns out that he's
missing, presumed dead.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.474
Found his car out in the boonies.

00:58.642 --> 01:02.770
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin,

01:02.938 --> 01:05.231
Emilio Koyama.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.442
You thinking the cousin
found out and took revenge?

01:07.609 --> 01:10.111
Could be. Turns out
he's missing too.

01:10.279 --> 01:13.698
And normally I'd say
someone did the world a favor.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.785
But our snitch's car, turns out
we find two grams of meth in it,

01:17.953 --> 01:19.996
we take it to the lab,
they come back,

01:20.164 --> 01:22.957
they tell us it is the purest
they've ever seen.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.626
Ninety-nine-point-one percent.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.212
I mean, our chemist is blown away. Said
he couldn't do the same thing better.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.757
Worse yet, it didn't come out
of some super lab in Mexico,

01:30.924 --> 01:34.093
we're thinking this was cooked right
here in the Land of Enchantment.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.764
Car was abandoned at
what appears to be a cook site.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.975
This is the, uh,
only other thing left behind.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.464
We're sending it off to Quantico,

01:42.603 --> 01:44.103
see if they can pull
something off it.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.355
Meantime, our guys swabbed
the filter element

01:46.523 --> 01:49.358
and found the same 99.1 meth.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.862
So be on notice.

01:53.030 --> 01:56.073
We got new players in town.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.786
Now, we don't know who they are,
or where they come from,

01:59.953 --> 02:02.413
but they possess
an extremely high skill set.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.333
Me, personally,

02:05.501 --> 02:09.170
I'm thinking Albuquerque
just might have a new kingpin.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.290
Jesus, Walt, you're burning
the shit out of them.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.709
Oh. Damn it.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.295
Hey, Sky,
you got any more chicken?

02:51.463 --> 02:53.464
Emeril here
is gonna need a fresh pack.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.424
Bam.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.884
All right, looking good.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.804
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the coleslaw?

02:59.972 --> 03:03.140
Uh, I... I don't know,
it's store-bought.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.934
Okay, uh, Hank,

03:05.102 --> 03:06.143
you need another beer?

03:06.311 --> 03:07.854
Does the pope shit in his hat?

03:08.021 --> 03:10.064
Yeah, I don't think
that he does, Hank,

03:10.232 --> 03:11.774
and I think everybody
would like it

03:11.942 --> 03:13.359
if you'd stop saying that.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.777
Marie, some more wine, maybe?

03:14.945 --> 03:15.945
I'm all right, thanks.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.738
All right.
Hey, I want a beer.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.033
Yeah, I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggy.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.119
Guess what.
It ain't happening either.

03:23.287 --> 03:24.620
How about some more soda, hm?

03:24.788 --> 03:25.872
Yeah, sure.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.160
Honey, do you need anything?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.666
Mm-mm. No, Walt,
thank you.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.210
Okay. Be right back.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.689
No.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.774
What, are you kidding me?

03:53.942 --> 03:56.277
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.946
Girls gotta be lining up
left and right.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.656
Tell him how
good-looking he is.

04:00.824 --> 04:01.949
He's adorable.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.952
He doesn't wanna be fricking
adorable, he wants to be hot.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.622
Anyway, see what I'm talking about?
That's female perspective.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.457
She's supposed to say that.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.876
Look, a guy doesn't
gotta look like, uh,

04:12.044 --> 04:15.796
you know, Charlton Heston...
I'm talking Moses days.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.423
- To get a girl, all right?

04:17.591 --> 04:21.469
You just gotta have confidence.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.305
Confidence and, uh...
And persistence.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.807
Okay? That's what
I'm talking about.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.477
I chased your aunt Marie here
all over creation.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.396
I kept bugging her for a date,
she kept saying no.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.231
What, I asked you,
like, 50 times?

04:34.399 --> 04:37.318
Yeah, it was before they
tightened the stalking laws.

04:38.987 --> 04:43.324
Anyway, how about your dad here?
That there's a good story, Walt.

04:43.492 --> 04:44.992
Tell him how you met Skyler.
Uh-huh.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.661
Mom was a waitress

04:46.828 --> 04:52.625
in Los Alamos, and Dad said
that thing to you.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.419
Well, actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress,

04:55.587 --> 04:59.840
it was a summer job,
and, um, she was the hostess

05:00.008 --> 05:02.593
and she also worked
the cash register.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.720
And I used to go in there a lot

05:04.888 --> 05:06.472
because it was close enough
to the lab

05:06.640 --> 05:09.475
where I could ride my bicycle.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.186
And once I noticed her,

05:12.354 --> 05:15.982
it got to be so that
I would only go in

05:16.149 --> 05:17.775
when I knew she was working.

05:17.943 --> 05:21.028
When it was slow, she would
lean against the counter,

05:21.196 --> 05:25.700
doing her crossword puzzles,
uh, but kind of hiding it.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.035
Right? Pretending that
she was still working,

05:28.203 --> 05:32.289
and once I caught on to that,
I would do crossword puzzles

05:32.457 --> 05:34.500
while I ate
my grilled-cheese sandwich.

05:34.668 --> 05:38.546
It got so that every day
at lunch, we would both be doing

05:38.714 --> 05:41.090
The New York Times
crossword puzzle

05:41.258 --> 05:44.552
10 feet from each other.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.971
And, uh... Heh-heh.

05:47.139 --> 05:52.393
Eventually, I caught her
looking over at me,

05:52.561 --> 05:54.520
so I began saying:

05:54.688 --> 05:58.190
"Excuse me, um, 14 across,

05:58.358 --> 06:00.401
seven-letter word
for whatchamacallit,

06:00.569 --> 06:02.361
uh, may I ask what?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.238
What you wrote down?"

06:04.406 --> 06:08.576
And, uh, well,
that got us talking,

06:08.744 --> 06:10.077
and, uh, boy,
I tell you, I was...

06:10.245 --> 06:12.079
I was terrible at those puzzles.

06:13.582 --> 06:17.084
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.463
But your mother
would do them in ink.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.756
Very smooth.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.718
I bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him, huh?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.428
But that's what
I'm talking about,

06:27.596 --> 06:29.055
that's persistence, you see?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.307
Once you set your cap
for something

06:31.475 --> 06:34.602
or somebody,
you gotta just, you know...

06:36.188 --> 06:38.564
Whoa. Skyler.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.108
Mom, a... Are you all right?

06:41.276 --> 06:43.277
Hey, hey.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.488
Shh. Honey, it's okay.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.448
What's the matter?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.620
What is it?

06:53.997 --> 06:55.748
Ask him.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.301
What's she talking about?

07:12.140 --> 07:13.474
Walt?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.478
Um...

07:20.816 --> 07:24.193
I have cancer.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.073
Lung cancer.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.668
It's bad.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.066
Ask him how long he's known.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.028
I guess a month, maybe.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.864
Oh, for God sakes, Walt.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.791
We're just sitting out there
having a cookout

08:11.908 --> 08:12.950
like nothing's going on.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.870
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.582
Christ, these last 48 hours.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.709
And it's the weekend,

08:21.877 --> 08:24.795
so I couldn't even get
his doctor on the phone.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.423
Buddy, why? I mean, why
wouldn't you wanna tell anybody?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.509
Walt, don't you see

08:30.677 --> 08:33.429
everybody just wants to help you.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.683
We're family. We get through
these things together.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.644
And I don't get,
you know, lung cancer?

08:40.812 --> 08:43.856
How can that happen?
You don't even smoke.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.568
You know, I'm thinking that
this goes back 20 years, maybe,

08:47.736 --> 08:49.195
to the applications lab,

08:49.362 --> 08:51.280
all those chemicals
they had you working around.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.574
We... We always took
the proper precautions.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.910
One time you complained
that they didn't give you

08:56.077 --> 08:57.745
the right kind of, um,
I don't know,

08:57.913 --> 09:00.789
some kind of ventilation hood
or something, and... And...

09:00.957 --> 09:03.584
And then the headaches.
Honey, it wasn't that.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.170
How do they think they
can get away with this?

09:06.338 --> 09:07.796
We should hire a lawyer.

09:07.964 --> 09:12.259
Okay, so first
let's deal with this.

09:12.427 --> 09:16.430
Okay, so,
what's the next step for Walt?

09:16.598 --> 09:19.600
Certainly
a second opinion, right?

09:19.768 --> 09:22.394
Right. Right, absolutely.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.941
Okay, so first thing tomorrow,
I talk to my radiologists,

09:27.108 --> 09:33.280
we find you the best,
the oncology dream team.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.366
That's good.
That's good.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.202
Yeah.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.289
Yeah?

09:42.457 --> 09:43.624
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.833
Yeah.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.758
I'm gonna go check on Walt Jr.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.136
I, um... I'm gonna see

09:56.304 --> 09:59.932
if I can talk him into,
I don't know, joining us.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.270
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.319
Walt, uh...

10:13.488 --> 10:15.990
whatever happens...

10:16.157 --> 10:22.329
I hope this goes without saying,
but, um, whatever happens,

10:22.497 --> 10:25.874
I want you to know that, um,

10:26.042 --> 10:29.503
I'll always take care
of your family.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.345
Yeah.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.325
Yo, check out these, uh,
fake Pop-Tarts.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.202
These are mad tight, yo.
No, thanks, man, pass.

11:02.370 --> 11:06.165
Your loss. These are from, like,
Canada, or something. Imported.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.417
Hey, yo, what happened
to your hallway, man?

11:08.585 --> 11:10.210
Did, like,
the ceiling fall down, or?

11:10.378 --> 11:13.213
Oh, yeah, uh, no, man,

11:13.381 --> 11:15.799
I think the house
is just settling.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.177
You know, it's been
caving in left and right.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.262
Hit me in the eye. Heh-heh.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.555
It's bananas.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.057
Yo, my pops could fix you up,

11:23.224 --> 11:25.559
he's, like, a contractor
or something.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.687
Yeah? Yeah, right on,
I should grab that number.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.065
Say, Jesse,
you still cook a little crystal?

11:34.277 --> 11:38.906
Uh, could be, yeah.
You know, from time to time.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.909
I heard you lost your partner.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.410
Emilio.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.581
- Didn't he get locked up?
- No, man, uh, he's out.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.999
His cousin bailed him out.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.607
I think he skipped town
or something.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.629
I don't know about any of that,
I've just been

11:53.797 --> 11:56.090
kind of doing my own thing
these days, so...

11:56.257 --> 11:58.842
But you maybe got
some crystal, man?

11:59.010 --> 12:01.512
Because I could seriously go for a bowl
right now, you know what I'm saying,

12:01.679 --> 12:02.846
take the edge off.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.599
Hell, yeah,
Sunday night bowl, yo.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.267
All right.

12:09.771 --> 12:13.816
Well, uh, maybe it
just so happens that, uh,

12:13.983 --> 12:17.611
I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.114
Yeah?

12:20.281 --> 12:22.908
Oh, yeah. Came up
with this whole new recipe.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.160
It's more like a formula.

12:25.328 --> 12:29.706
It's, like,
way, way more chemically...

12:29.874 --> 12:32.793
Shit, you know, it's...
It's just the bomb, so...

12:33.795 --> 12:37.047
But, you know, I don't know,
I've been thinking lately

12:37.215 --> 12:39.216
I'll just lay off of it
for a while,

12:39.384 --> 12:42.469
because lately it's been kind of
making me paranoid, so...

12:47.308 --> 12:50.686
You know, for, like,
health-wise, just lay off.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.604
Yo, if you're, uh,
not into sharing, man,

12:52.772 --> 12:55.107
just tell us to piss off,
it's cool.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.317
We don't need no soap opera.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.820
Yeah, man, whatever.
No, no, it's all good, you know.

12:59.988 --> 13:04.158
L-I'm just saying, uh, hey,
I got... I got plenty of pot.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.618
Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.996
Yeah, sounds about right.

13:09.164 --> 13:13.500
Hey, yo, yo.
Hey, homes, I'm joking.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.670
Okay, I'm totally joking
with you.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.423
You kidding? Sit down.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.765
Best scante ever.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.058
Grab that pipe.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.235
Okay, there.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.077
Shit.

16:45.505 --> 16:49.716
Walt, do you need some help?

16:51.094 --> 16:52.928
Oh, no, I'm... I'm fine, honey.

16:53.096 --> 16:56.723
I'm fine. Just, uh, privacy.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.850
Thanks.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.563
I'm right outside if you need me.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.065
Okay.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.366
Yeah, any time on Friday
is absolutely fine.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.285
Thank you so much
for working us in.

17:18.496 --> 17:22.416
Uh, can I just put that
on a credit card?

17:22.583 --> 17:24.710
Great. Perfect.

17:24.877 --> 17:29.965
Okay, so we will see you
at 10:45 on Friday morning.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.759
Thank you so much.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.469
Okay.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.473
Oh, yes.

17:38.641 --> 17:42.102
Honey, the best oncologist,

17:42.270 --> 17:43.729
I mean, not even
just in New Mexico,

17:43.896 --> 17:46.982
but one of the top 10
in the entire nation,

17:47.150 --> 17:50.444
his name is, um, Dr. Delcavoli

17:50.611 --> 17:52.696
and we see him on Friday.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.615
Ah.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.826
I mean, Marie really
came through for us.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.120
She had her boss call, and...

18:02.749 --> 18:07.335
Okay, this is good.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.296
From here on out, I mean,
things are gonna...

18:09.464 --> 18:11.840
What's? What's that we're
putting on a credit card?

18:12.008 --> 18:15.469
Uh, it's just a deposit
kind of thing.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.762
How much of a deposit?

18:16.929 --> 18:19.765
It's $5000.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.558
Five thousand?

18:23.978 --> 18:25.854
Jesus.

18:28.691 --> 18:29.858
What's that, just to start?

18:30.026 --> 18:33.153
I mean, just to tell me
what I already know?

18:33.321 --> 18:35.822
Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay?

18:35.990 --> 18:38.825
So be it, we'll figure it out.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.747
Come on,
don't get hung up on money here.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.749
I mean, we can
always borrow from Hank.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.501
Absolutely not.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.671
No, I just...

18:51.839 --> 18:53.006
We're not gonna do that.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.176
Well, maybe we can ask your mom.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.639
Have you even called her yet?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.520
Walt, regardless, you're gonna
have to tell her about this.

19:06.687 --> 19:10.023
I'm willing to do it, but I...
I'll call. I'll call.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.859
Okay, look,

19:13.027 --> 19:16.822
I don't even want us
thinking about money.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.032
Money is not the issue here.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.785
It's not.
I know. I know.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.413
It's not.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.040
Okay.
Okay.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.417
Okay.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.045
I'll take care of the deposit.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.214
Yeah?

19:34.382 --> 19:35.882
Yeah.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.717
I'll, uh...

19:37.885 --> 19:40.595
I'll borrow it from my pension.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.502
Oh, damn it!

20:15.172 --> 20:16.756
Hey. Heh-heh.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.800
Hey, pal, what's up?

20:20.803 --> 20:24.306
Oh, uh, yeah, no,
I thought I heard mice.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.726
Heh. Boy, that's...
That's all we need, huh?

20:29.437 --> 20:31.396
So, what's up, pal?

20:31.564 --> 20:34.608
What the hell's wrong with you?

20:36.777 --> 20:37.777
What?

20:37.945 --> 20:41.281
You're... You're acting all...

20:41.449 --> 20:43.617
You're... You...

20:43.784 --> 20:49.247
You're all...
Why are you acting so weird?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.457
Son.
You're...

20:50.625 --> 20:53.168
You're acting like
nothing is going on.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.432
Oh, no, please.
Please, please, no.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.443
Hey, no, hey!

22:43.320 --> 22:44.821
- Hey!
- Put that douche bag

22:44.989 --> 22:46.823
- on the phone.
- Oh, come on.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.117
Hey, am I? Am I gonna
have to come down there

22:49.285 --> 22:50.702
and whup your ass?

23:03.841 --> 23:05.202
And let me tell you
something else,

23:05.259 --> 23:07.343
I'm not doing this
for charity, right?

23:07.511 --> 23:10.311
I'm hands down the best he's got in that office.
He knows it, I know it,

23:10.347 --> 23:13.433
I expect to be paid
to a level commensurate with...

23:13.601 --> 23:16.770
I said, "Dave, do you think
40 grand is a proper bonus?"

23:16.937 --> 23:20.098
That's less than 10 percent of what I
booked for you guys this quarter. Come on.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.400
I'm not gonna sit here
and be disrespect...

23:22.568 --> 23:24.736
Oh, he's shitting bricks.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.279
Oh, you know he is.

23:26.447 --> 23:28.948
Yeah, that man lives in fear
I'll go across town...

23:29.116 --> 23:30.450
Hell, I could go anywhere.

23:30.618 --> 23:33.161
Hoffman, Gordon Bradley,
or Sorcher.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.288
Even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make
me a partner at Goldberg-Wayne

23:35.456 --> 23:36.777
just for walking
in the damn door,

23:36.832 --> 23:38.032
that's how ecstatic they'd be.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.209
Next customer.

23:39.376 --> 23:42.587
Hells, yes, brother man.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.423
Dude, you should check
this chick out.

23:45.591 --> 23:49.928
Who? No.
Buddy, she's a cow.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.930
Stacey's a cow.

23:52.098 --> 23:55.141
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.060
Roll her in flour
and look for the wet spot

23:57.228 --> 23:59.479
before you hit that, man,
you know what I'm saying?

23:59.647 --> 24:02.273
That kind of stink
does not wash off.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.984
- Sir?
- Ha-ha-ha. Right.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.570
Sir.

24:07.738 --> 24:08.863
Oh, yeah?

24:09.031 --> 24:10.573
- Sorry. Hi.
- Yeah. Oh, totally.

24:10.741 --> 24:12.325
Hi. What can I do
for you today?

24:12.493 --> 24:13.493
Which dude?

24:13.661 --> 24:15.829
- Dude that looks like a lizard?
- Next in line.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.872
- I, um...
- He limps like some leper.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.958
I... I'm sorry.
I... I would like...

24:20.126 --> 24:21.167
Grosses me out.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.461
A cashier's check
in the full amount,

24:23.629 --> 24:28.591
made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

24:28.759 --> 24:33.555
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.141
Yeah, you got it.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.060
I don't understand why

24:39.228 --> 24:41.771
they're forcing you to choose
between the piccolo and the oboe.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.815
You show so much promise
with both.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.317
They say they can't have any
switching between woodwinds.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.862
Because no matter how they divide
it up, someone would be left out.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.822
Well, rules are rules, I guess.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.782
- Sure, rules are rules.
- I'm all for that.

24:52.950 --> 24:56.369
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.746
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.707
Thanks.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.375
What about Mr. Pemberton?

25:02.543 --> 25:04.836
Is he giving you
enough individual attention?

25:05.004 --> 25:07.297
I'd have to say so. He tries
to talk to each one of us

25:07.464 --> 25:09.132
at least once
during every practice.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.718
That's good.
Feedback's important.

25:11.886 --> 25:14.012
It's key, I think.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.973
Hey, so how was soccer practice?

25:19.935 --> 25:22.437
I think that was in our backyard.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.739
Who's there?

25:39.246 --> 25:42.248
What the hell are you doing
out here?

25:44.752 --> 25:46.085
Hey, Dad.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.005
Hey, Mom.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.007
Jake.

25:51.175 --> 25:54.344
Got new patio furniture.

25:54.511 --> 25:57.138
Right on.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.142
Hey. Heh-heh. My leg.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.918
What do you think it could be?

27:10.254 --> 27:12.547
God knows I'm no expert.

27:12.715 --> 27:16.384
I don't know. Uppers, downers?
Your guess is as good as mine.

27:16.552 --> 27:20.972
I think we should check
his arms for needle marks.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.851
Do we let him stay?

27:25.978 --> 27:29.063
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

27:29.231 --> 27:33.026
So maybe on condition, you know?
If he agrees to attend.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.904
I... I just don't know
what to tell Jake.

27:44.455 --> 27:45.455
Hey.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.624
Hey. Good evening.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.210
Well?
Sleep well?

27:51.378 --> 27:52.837
What time's, uh?

27:53.005 --> 27:55.506
What time is dinner?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.717
In about an hour.

28:00.929 --> 28:04.015
You know, I could, uh, wash
those clothes if you like.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.225
They look a little lived in.

28:06.393 --> 28:10.855
Oh, um, no, that's cool.
Yeah, maybe later.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.153
We are not doing this again.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.113
Adam...
No.

28:19.281 --> 28:22.450
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.703
We just have to be
consistent about it.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.334
Hey.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.586
You're, uh...

29:15.754 --> 29:17.880
You're not taking the bus?

29:19.133 --> 29:21.092
Oh.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.343
All right. Well, listen.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.304
Um, give me
maybe another 20 minutes,

29:25.472 --> 29:27.098
and we'll get out of here.

29:27.266 --> 29:31.144
All right.

29:31.311 --> 29:32.770
Yeah, good.

30:03.719 --> 30:07.513
You know, I...
I just think that, uh...

30:10.017 --> 30:13.978
things have a way
of working themselves out.

30:37.211 --> 30:38.669
Wow.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.963
When did you, uh?
When did you get this?

30:41.131 --> 30:43.382
Last May
at the year-end assembly.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.427
They gave me that one too.
The one on the end.

30:47.721 --> 30:51.432
Environmental
Consciousness Award.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.478
What's that mean? What, you,
like, recycle cans and shit?

30:55.646 --> 30:57.438
I contacted
The Albuquerque Journal

30:57.606 --> 31:00.441
and asked what kind of chemicals
they use to bleach their paper.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.068
They wound up writing
an article about it.

31:02.236 --> 31:03.736
Right on, little bro.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.739
Making mad inroads
with the business community.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.533
All right.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.535
Now, hey, remember,

31:10.702 --> 31:14.413
not all learning
comes out of books.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.002
Look at you. Heh.

31:20.170 --> 31:23.089
You know, we should... We
should hang out more often.

31:23.257 --> 31:27.552
You know, just, uh...
Just kick back and chill.

31:27.719 --> 31:32.807
I mean, if you ever, like,
I don't know, need advice.

31:32.975 --> 31:34.225
Because, you know, I've been...

31:34.393 --> 31:37.103
I've been through it all.
For real.

31:40.107 --> 31:43.859
Yeah, man, you, uh?
You play the flute?

31:44.027 --> 31:46.445
It's a piccolo, actually.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.373
Dude, play some, uh...
Play some Jethro Tull.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.996
Hey, guys, how we doing in here?

31:55.163 --> 31:57.331
We're, uh... We're good.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.084
Jake?

32:00.252 --> 32:01.627
Yeah. Fine, Mom.

32:01.795 --> 32:06.382
Well, that's good.
That's... That's great.

32:13.932 --> 32:18.311
You know, what the hell?
You see this?

32:18.478 --> 32:20.313
What am I,
some criminal or something?

32:21.148 --> 32:22.315
Whatever.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.983
Whatever?

32:24.151 --> 32:26.444
What, you?
You think that's okay?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.863
Like, "Oh, we can't
let that scumbag

32:29.031 --> 32:32.116
warp the mind
of our favorite son."

32:32.284 --> 32:33.826
I'm the favorite?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.746
Yeah, right.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.206
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.557
Oh, snap.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.727
Awesome.

34:55.385 --> 34:56.677
Yeah?

34:56.845 --> 34:58.053
Yo, man, it's me.

34:58.221 --> 35:01.932
Hey, listen. You know that,
uh? That product?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.893
You got any more of that?

35:04.060 --> 35:06.145
No, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.647
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.649
No, no charity. No.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.152
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.113
These dudes are in town,
they're looking to party.

35:16.281 --> 35:19.825
And your stuff is, like,
so sweet.

35:19.993 --> 35:22.244
So, what do you say?

35:22.412 --> 35:24.288
You up for making
some fat stacks?

35:24.456 --> 35:27.208
Because they'll buy
everything you got.

35:36.718 --> 35:40.387
Yes. Yes. Okay.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.437
Oh, you can't be serious.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.607
What the hell are you doing here?

35:51.775 --> 35:53.651
Yo, I waited
till the ball buster left.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.445
I mean, no offense.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.990
Who sent you, huh? Huh?

36:00.158 --> 36:01.534
You wearing a wire?
Hey. Jesus.

36:01.701 --> 36:02.785
You setting me up?

36:02.953 --> 36:05.496
Homo. A wire? You want a wire?

36:05.664 --> 36:08.457
I got a wire.
Speak into the mike, bitch.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.167
What the hell's wrong with you?

36:10.335 --> 36:12.211
A wire.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.754
Jesus.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.508
So who did you tell about?

36:17.676 --> 36:18.884
Nobody. What, are you nuts?

36:19.052 --> 36:21.053
Then why are you here?

36:22.806 --> 36:24.557
I don't know.

36:24.724 --> 36:28.060
To, like, touch base.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.895
Touch base?

36:30.897 --> 36:33.023
Yeah, you know, um,

36:33.191 --> 36:36.861
what they call a debrief.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.779
Maybe we could, like...

36:38.947 --> 36:40.739
Thought we could debrief.

36:40.907 --> 36:43.033
Debrief?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.785
Wow, that's...

36:44.953 --> 36:48.247
That's what you think
we need, debrief?

36:49.833 --> 36:51.750
Yeah, after what happened,

36:51.918 --> 36:54.420
it just seems
like the thing to do.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.589
Kind of, you know, talk about it.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.758
I mean, we can't...
We can't talk to anybody else.

37:01.011 --> 37:03.888
Anyway, th...
That and I wanted to, uh...

37:04.055 --> 37:05.222
Wanted to, you know,

37:05.390 --> 37:09.393
tell you how much everybody digs
that meth we cooked.

37:09.561 --> 37:13.689
Everybody digs the meth
we cooked.

37:14.524 --> 37:18.611
Seriously. I got dudes
that would give their left nut

37:18.778 --> 37:20.070
for a little more.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.739
Oh. Great.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.950
I'm just saying,
I mean, if you ever,

37:25.118 --> 37:29.163
you know, saw your way clear
to, um, you know,

37:29.331 --> 37:34.043
you and I cooking
a little more...

37:38.006 --> 37:39.298
Wow.

37:41.343 --> 37:43.802
Get the hell off my property.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.805
What? I'm just saying.
Go. And don't come back.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.891
Now.

37:50.602 --> 37:54.730
All right.
All right, you know what?

37:54.898 --> 37:57.650
Four grand.

37:57.817 --> 38:01.487
Your share
from selling that batch.

38:01.655 --> 38:04.490
That's why I'm here.

38:04.658 --> 38:09.578
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Hey, I didn't smoke it all.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.730
Non-small-cell adenocarcinoma.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.357
Stage 3A,

38:38.525 --> 38:41.694
which means it's spread from
the lung to the lymph nodes.

38:41.861 --> 38:44.738
There's no denying
it's very serious.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.533
But it... Is it?

38:47.701 --> 38:50.160
It is...

38:50.328 --> 38:51.704
curable?

38:51.871 --> 38:55.207
I prefer the word
"treatable."

38:55.375 --> 38:57.084
But the treatments we have
at our disposal

38:57.252 --> 38:58.335
can be very effective.

38:58.503 --> 39:00.212
Without making any promises,

39:00.380 --> 39:01.900
I can tell you
that the specific course

39:02.048 --> 39:04.675
of radiation and chemotherapy
I'm going to suggest

39:04.843 --> 39:06.176
has been successful.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.345
In certain cases,
it's prolonged a patient's life

39:08.513 --> 39:11.807
and even resulted in remission.

39:11.975 --> 39:15.060
Hmm. Um, what about
the side effects?

39:15.228 --> 39:18.772
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.358
Or they can be pretty darn awful.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.901
It varies from patient
to patient.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.695
Typically, there's hair loss,

39:24.863 --> 39:28.741
which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

39:28.908 --> 39:32.202
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.246
You won't want to get out of bed.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.290
You may lose weight
due to reduced appetite

39:36.458 --> 39:38.459
and certain intestinal issues.

39:38.626 --> 39:42.588
Muscle aches and pains,
gums will get sore and bleed.

39:42.756 --> 39:45.883
And, uh, of course, there's
the possibility of nausea,

39:46.051 --> 39:48.135
although we'll prescribe
an antiemetic

39:48.303 --> 39:49.511
and try to counteract that.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.722
Possible kidney
or bladder irritation.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.391
You may wind up with increased
bruising and bleeding.

39:54.559 --> 39:59.438
There are maybe sexual symptoms.
Your skin may become dry...

40:28.635 --> 40:31.595
Got anything to say?

40:37.393 --> 40:39.019
What do you know about that?

40:40.480 --> 40:41.688
Nothing.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.315
Well, that's not
gonna fly this time.

40:43.483 --> 40:46.151
How many chances
have we given you?

40:46.319 --> 40:48.737
How many times
have we sat right here

40:48.905 --> 40:50.906
and had the same conversation
over and over again?

40:51.074 --> 40:53.617
Where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance?

40:53.785 --> 40:55.369
And you play on our emotions

40:55.537 --> 40:57.996
and you tell us
anything and everything

40:58.164 --> 41:00.833
you think we wanna hear, just so
we'll give you another chance.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.461
Mm-hm.
And it makes us feel like fools.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.004
Every time.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.511
Enough, Jesse.

41:12.679 --> 41:13.846
Enough.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.933
We are not going to
have this in our house.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.895
We need you to leave.

42:01.102 --> 42:03.353
Thanks for not telling on me.

42:07.775 --> 42:11.236
Uh, you think
I could have it back?

42:25.668 --> 42:27.461
It's skunk-weed anyway.

42:43.144 --> 42:45.938
While 3 percent
are listed as unknown.

42:46.105 --> 42:48.690
The Air Force is aware
of the widely-held belief

42:48.858 --> 42:51.360
that some of these
could be flying saucers from...

42:51.527 --> 42:53.779
You know,
this is actually very hopeful.

42:53.947 --> 42:55.739
Nothing conclusive
in the evidence,

42:55.907 --> 42:58.617
but probing and digesting
of information about UFOs

42:58.785 --> 43:00.285
continues unceasingly.

43:00.453 --> 43:02.287
Did you hear me?

43:02.455 --> 43:06.083
I said this is really
very, very hopeful.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.584
Oh.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.962
Defense Command in Colorado
Springs issued an order...

43:10.129 --> 43:11.922
So can I call them and?

43:12.090 --> 43:15.300
And tell them
you'll start next week?

43:15.468 --> 43:16.760
Uh...

43:16.928 --> 43:19.388
Even as they did so,
the military wondered whether

43:19.555 --> 43:22.140
their scientific know-how
and their best weapons

43:22.308 --> 43:23.642
would be effective in any battle

43:23.810 --> 43:29.523
of the Earth
versus the flying saucers.

43:29.691 --> 43:33.318
I just think that
we need to discuss it

43:33.486 --> 43:34.653
a little more, that's all.

43:34.821 --> 43:37.281
What is there to discuss?

43:37.448 --> 43:40.993
You're gonna get the best
treatment, and he's the best.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.036
Well, there's the money
discussion. I think...

43:43.204 --> 43:46.790
No, $90,000 out of pocket.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.959
- Maybe more.
- There's a way, Walt.

43:49.127 --> 43:52.879
There's financing,
there's, um, installment plans.

43:53.047 --> 43:55.048
I... I could always go back
to work.

43:55.216 --> 43:57.134
Walt, there's always a way.

43:57.302 --> 43:58.427
All right.

43:58.594 --> 44:01.638
Skyler, say that there is a way.

44:01.806 --> 44:04.808
And we spend
all that money, and...

44:16.529 --> 44:20.866
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

44:21.034 --> 44:22.075
No.

44:22.243 --> 44:24.119
Honey.

44:24.287 --> 44:27.706
I just don't want
emotions ruling us.

44:27.874 --> 44:31.209
Maybe treatment
isn't the way to go.

44:32.462 --> 44:33.754
Then why don't you just

44:33.921 --> 44:35.922
fucking die, already?

44:38.968 --> 44:41.428
Just give up and die.

45:30.853 --> 45:33.355
Come on, move your ass.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.942
Uh, name of the guy?
You'll like him.

45:38.528 --> 45:39.653
Yeah, dude, I'm not worried.

45:39.821 --> 45:42.114
I got the best fricking attorney.

45:42.281 --> 45:44.783
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one.

45:44.951 --> 45:47.160
He's got this little team
of ninjas, too,

45:47.328 --> 45:49.121
that go out and do forward
operations...

45:49.288 --> 45:51.581
He's got crap on people.

47:03.863 --> 47:05.697
What the hell?

47:09.368 --> 47:10.368
What?

47:10.536 --> 47:11.953
Don't go near it, buddy.

47:12.121 --> 47:14.039
- What? What are you doing?
- Call somebody.

47:14.207 --> 47:15.540
Call the fire people.

47:15.708 --> 47:17.584
Yeah. I have a fire...

47:17.752 --> 47:20.545
I don't believe this. Do you
know how much I paid for that?

47:25.510 --> 47:27.677
Why are you doing this?
