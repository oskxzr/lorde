00:52.547 --> 00:54.288
Let's get something straight.

00:54.413 --> 00:57.405
This, the chemistry, is my realm.

00:57.630 --> 00:59.808
I am in charge of the cooking.

00:59.921 --> 01:02.929
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

01:05.641 --> 01:08.903
As far as our customers go,
I don't wanna know anything about them.

01:08.973 --> 01:11.598
I don't want to see them.
I don't want to hear from them.

01:11.601 --> 01:14.549
I want no interaction
with them whatsoever.

01:18.048 --> 01:22.045
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

01:22.367 --> 01:24.471
You got any issues with that?

01:25.618 --> 01:27.134
Whatever, man.

01:33.721 --> 01:35.650
No matter what happens,

01:36.401 --> 01:38.042
no more bloodshed.

01:39.446 --> 01:40.863
No violence.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.904
"Crazy Handful of Nothin'"

02:34.930 --> 02:35.782
Walt?

02:36.955 --> 02:39.059
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

02:39.682 --> 02:41.160
Yeah. I'm okay.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.497
You know, honey,
you really don't have to...

02:47.178 --> 02:50.259
Look, I like being here with you.

02:53.325 --> 02:55.180
I'm only saying that,

02:55.268 --> 02:58.664
I'd be okay with it, really,
if you want to go.

03:00.365 --> 03:02.959
You know, actually,

03:02.996 --> 03:05.960
it would make me feel a little better
knowing that you were there

03:05.961 --> 03:09.006
when Walter Jr.
gets home from school.

03:12.529 --> 03:13.318
Okay.

03:15.893 --> 03:16.960
All right.

03:17.045 --> 03:19.970
- You'll call me when you're finished?
- Oh, yeah.

03:24.333 --> 03:26.412
And have you been
in touch with Elliott?

03:26.417 --> 03:29.952
Because I haven't
seen a check from him.

03:30.292 --> 03:31.895
Yes, I got it.

03:32.465 --> 03:34.387
- Really?
- It came, yeah.

03:35.438 --> 03:37.517
Yeah, it came last week,

03:37.520 --> 03:41.207
and I put it right into
my credit union account, so...

03:42.071 --> 03:43.699
Taken care of it.

03:45.591 --> 03:46.443
Good.

03:47.870 --> 03:49.900
So we're good. We're good.

03:53.152 --> 03:56.121
Could you not deposit this

03:56.497 --> 03:58.300
until Monday?

04:00.982 --> 04:01.959
Thank you.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.660
Call if the discomfort's too much.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.034
Otherwise,
we'll see you next week.

04:07.483 --> 04:08.286
Yeah.

04:29.827 --> 04:33.747
Chemical reactions
involve change on two levels:

04:33.823 --> 04:35.740
matter and energy.

04:36.936 --> 04:39.352
When a reaction is gradual,

04:40.018 --> 04:42.937
the change in energy is slight.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.404
I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

04:46.567 --> 04:47.870
For example,

04:48.663 --> 04:52.182
when rust collects
on the underside of a car.

04:57.208 --> 05:00.903
But if a reaction
happens quickly,

05:01.816 --> 05:05.533
otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way

05:05.603 --> 05:09.553
that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

05:14.104 --> 05:17.211
Who can give me an example

05:17.225 --> 05:20.004
of rapid chemical reaction?

05:25.265 --> 05:27.431
Hint, hint. Right here.

05:28.279 --> 05:30.109
Like an explosion?

05:31.236 --> 05:32.425
Yes. Good.

05:32.847 --> 05:34.150
Explosions.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.907
Explosions are the result

05:37.133 --> 05:39.061
of chemical reactions

05:39.301 --> 05:41.832
happening almost instantaneously.

05:42.082 --> 05:45.533
And the faster reactants,
i.e., explosives,

05:45.765 --> 05:49.135
and fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that,

05:49.838 --> 05:52.443
the faster they undergo change,

05:53.019 --> 05:55.298
the more violent the explosion.

05:58.408 --> 06:00.956
So... explosions.

06:02.031 --> 06:05.241
Okay, listen. Why don't you
start reading on your own

06:05.242 --> 06:08.711
from the top of chapter 7,
all right?

06:23.565 --> 06:24.742
You okay?

06:26.203 --> 06:28.145
I got it, Mr. White.

06:28.506 --> 06:29.905
Don't worry.

06:30.218 --> 06:32.259
You got kids to teach.

06:52.796 --> 06:54.223
Thanks, Hugo.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.321
He's starting to lose weight,

07:08.515 --> 07:10.469
which is tough...

07:12.135 --> 07:13.437
to see that.

07:13.852 --> 07:16.147
You know, to feel
the difference when I put my

07:16.189 --> 07:18.482
arms around him.

07:26.303 --> 07:29.032
- Can I talk to him?
- Of course.

07:30.481 --> 07:31.358
Walt...

07:34.596 --> 07:38.469
when you don't let me in,
when you don't tell me what's going on,

07:39.043 --> 07:42.832
I think it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

07:42.932 --> 07:43.747
No.

07:44.722 --> 07:47.883
And recently these afternoons,

07:48.316 --> 07:50.848
when you're coming home so late

07:50.949 --> 07:53.471
and we're just left wondering

07:53.780 --> 07:55.421
where you are.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.073
Yeah, Dad.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.525
What's up with that?

08:03.022 --> 08:06.230
Walt, is there anything else

08:06.706 --> 08:09.273
you're holding back
from your family?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.050
Now's the time to share.

08:17.162 --> 08:18.164
Well...

08:23.443 --> 08:26.126
I like to be alone,
I mean at times,

08:26.220 --> 08:28.799
and it's not about you, really.

08:30.255 --> 08:33.217
It's just that sometimes
it feels better

08:34.040 --> 08:37.649
not to talk at all...

08:39.819 --> 08:42.965
about anything, to anyone.

08:44.026 --> 08:46.890
Alone time can be helpful
for some types.

08:49.315 --> 08:52.184
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone

08:53.286 --> 08:55.879
might make it easier
for your family

08:56.042 --> 08:59.860
to be more accepting
of whatever it is you do alone.

09:02.325 --> 09:03.415
Well...

09:05.537 --> 09:08.405
I like to go on walks

09:09.519 --> 09:13.030
a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work,

09:15.538 --> 09:19.071
And I really enjoy the nature.

09:20.706 --> 09:23.060
You know, the cacti,

09:24.500 --> 09:27.206
the vegetation,
that kind of thing.

09:29.173 --> 09:33.157
It's really very therapeutic.

10:03.435 --> 10:05.088
Yo! You okay?

10:06.235 --> 10:09.403
- Did you breathe that shit?
- No. I'm just dizzy.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.277
Come here.

10:12.634 --> 10:14.414
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm burning up.

10:14.444 --> 10:15.834
Take this off.

10:18.776 --> 10:20.768
Sit down. Get some air.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.526
Oh, God.

10:31.483 --> 10:33.123
Yeah, that's better.

10:39.133 --> 10:41.300
When were you going to tell me?

10:43.901 --> 10:45.529
Tell you what?

10:46.321 --> 10:47.498
Cancer.

10:48.344 --> 10:50.075
You got it, right?

10:57.446 --> 10:58.999
How did you know?

10:59.061 --> 11:02.670
My aunt had one
of those dots on her,

11:03.553 --> 11:05.287
to target the radiation.

11:05.325 --> 11:07.301
What is it, in your lung?

11:08.514 --> 11:11.312
I'm your partner, man.
You should have told me.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.155
That's not cool,
okay? Not at all.

11:17.361 --> 11:19.090
What stage are you?

11:20.862 --> 11:21.869
3a.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.707
Gone to your lymph nodes.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.303
Your aunt.

11:41.477 --> 11:43.982
How bad was she
when they caught it?

11:44.842 --> 11:47.461
Bad enough.
She didn't last long.

11:49.323 --> 11:50.299
How long?

11:50.650 --> 11:52.341
Seven months.

11:59.123 --> 12:00.540
I get it now.

12:00.941 --> 12:03.157
That's why you're doing all this.

12:03.570 --> 12:06.812
You want to make some cash for
your people before you check out.

12:06.831 --> 12:09.069
- You got a problem with that?
- You tell me.

12:09.072 --> 12:12.933
You're the one that looks like you
just crawled out of a microwave.

12:18.373 --> 12:20.678
You going to be able
to finish the batch?

12:20.803 --> 12:21.610
Yes.

12:22.807 --> 12:23.858
All right.

12:27.956 --> 12:28.720
No.

12:30.736 --> 12:32.051
You do it.

12:34.979 --> 12:35.793
Me?

12:36.924 --> 12:37.750
Yeah.

12:38.746 --> 12:41.953
What happened to your mad skills?

12:48.207 --> 12:49.610
Go on. Here.

12:50.241 --> 12:51.631
You do it.

12:55.331 --> 12:56.907
You can do it.

13:02.452 --> 13:05.507
If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

13:10.885 --> 13:14.465
The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

13:15.849 --> 13:18.742
My aunt said it helped
with the hair loss.

13:55.766 --> 13:58.020
What's this? Christmas?

14:01.364 --> 14:04.617
This the one we found way out
in the boonies, the cook site?

14:08.094 --> 14:09.960
- Holy shit.
- What?

14:10.228 --> 14:12.419
Lab pulled up an imprint
of some old writing

14:12.424 --> 14:15.229
that used to be on the inside.
Old Magic Marker or something.

14:15.246 --> 14:16.726
Yeah? What's it say?

14:16.804 --> 14:19.572
"Property of J.P. Wynne
Chemistry Lab."

14:20.721 --> 14:22.425
That's Walt's school.

15:41.537 --> 15:43.917
We were supposed to start at 3.

15:44.017 --> 15:47.047
I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

15:47.700 --> 15:50.958
Hey. Prepaid cell phone.
Use it.

15:59.932 --> 16:02.411
- How much is this?
- 26 big ones.

16:03.493 --> 16:06.222
Is that all? $26,000?

16:06.435 --> 16:08.289
No, that's 26 hundred,

16:08.515 --> 16:10.907
and your share is 13,

16:11.551 --> 16:13.817
minus 25 bucks for that phone.

16:14.532 --> 16:17.752
- How much meth did you sell?
- Nearly an ounce.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.464
Last time I checked,
there were 16 ounces to a pound.

16:25.467 --> 16:26.785
You smoked the rest?

16:26.822 --> 16:29.466
I've been out there
all night slinging crystal.

16:29.597 --> 16:32.588
You think it's cake moving a pound
of meth one teenth at a time?

16:32.614 --> 16:34.750
Why are you selling it
in such small quantities?

16:34.756 --> 16:37.277
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

16:37.327 --> 16:39.409
To who? What do I
look like, Scarface?

16:39.456 --> 16:41.605
This is unacceptable.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.018
I am breaking the law here.

16:44.081 --> 16:46.516
This return is too little
for the risk.

16:46.530 --> 16:48.923
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound today.

16:48.931 --> 16:50.701
You may know a lot
about chemistry,

16:50.704 --> 16:53.603
but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

16:54.042 --> 16:57.739
Well, I'll tell you, I know
a lack of motivation when I see it.

16:59.829 --> 17:02.960
You've got to be more
imaginative, you know?

17:03.240 --> 17:05.741
Just think outside the box here.

17:06.103 --> 17:09.962
We have to move our product
in bulk, wholesale, now.

17:11.542 --> 17:13.027
How do we do that?

17:14.818 --> 17:17.362
- What do you mean, to a distributor?
- Yes. Yes.

17:17.382 --> 17:19.686
That's what we need.
We need a distributor now.

17:19.786 --> 17:21.683
Do you know anyone like that?

17:21.708 --> 17:25.087
Yeah, I mean I used to
until you killed him.

17:38.564 --> 17:42.478
So who took Krazy-8's place?

17:42.944 --> 17:44.923
Some guy named Tuco.

17:45.576 --> 17:47.565
A bad ass, from what I hear.

17:47.922 --> 17:51.356
Tuco, okay. So then
just go talk to Tuco.

17:51.858 --> 17:52.947
Right. Like,

17:52.956 --> 17:55.346
"Hello, sir. Hey, I know
you don't know me,

17:55.390 --> 17:58.259
"but would you be interested in
a felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

17:58.282 --> 18:01.527
Well, yes, but maybe with a little more
salesmanship, perhaps?

18:01.530 --> 18:03.739
You just don't get it, man.
This guy's O.G.

18:03.777 --> 18:05.487
What does that mean?

18:05.623 --> 18:07.585
Jesus, look,
he's upper level, man.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.969
He's not going to do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.102
You don't understand
the way it works.

18:13.110 --> 18:16.213
You can't just bum rush
some high-level ice man

18:16.217 --> 18:18.126
and start cutting deals, okay?

18:18.148 --> 18:20.150
It's risky.
You need an intro.

18:20.156 --> 18:22.144
You need someone to vouch.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.355
Well, who introduced you
to Krazy-8?

18:24.365 --> 18:27.270
Emilio. That's only because
I knew him from, like, third grade.

18:27.291 --> 18:30.969
- We can't talk to Emilio, either...
- All right, all right.

18:31.108 --> 18:34.473
Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, it's too risky.

18:35.586 --> 18:37.917
Okay?
I mean, we're making money.

18:37.963 --> 18:40.894
Why can't you just be satisfied
with the way it is?

18:40.910 --> 18:41.769
Jesus!

18:41.787 --> 18:44.008
Just grow some fucking balls!

19:25.658 --> 19:27.265
Wait till Monday again?

19:27.284 --> 19:29.413
Yes, please. Thank you.

20:00.420 --> 20:01.549
Mr. White.

20:08.013 --> 20:09.420
Thank you, Hugo.

20:34.915 --> 20:36.910
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, hey.

20:37.296 --> 20:39.814
- How are you feeling, Walt?
- Good.

20:41.735 --> 20:43.939
Are you up for having a visitor?

20:44.269 --> 20:45.535
Hey, buddy.

20:47.183 --> 20:47.935
Hank.

20:48.150 --> 20:49.933
Let me know if you need anything.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.596
- I will. Thank you, Carmen.
- No problem.

20:53.922 --> 20:54.899
Damn.

20:55.486 --> 20:57.585
That chick's got
an ass like an onion.

20:57.610 --> 20:59.326
Makes me want to cry.

21:00.253 --> 21:03.537
So what are you doing here?

21:03.831 --> 21:06.737
Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you,

21:06.799 --> 21:08.204
work-related.

21:08.401 --> 21:11.882
- You okay? I could come back later.
- No, no, no, no. I'm fine.

21:12.039 --> 21:13.530
Everything's fine.

21:14.236 --> 21:16.790
What do you mean
work-related, though?

21:18.439 --> 21:20.819
Do you recognize that?

21:24.796 --> 21:25.624
No.

21:28.317 --> 21:30.408
That was used to cook meth.

21:31.281 --> 21:34.992
Found that on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

21:35.242 --> 21:38.285
Old label on the inside
used to say...

21:39.601 --> 21:41.532
J.P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.

21:41.632 --> 21:42.733
Really?

21:42.948 --> 21:45.741
I don't understand
how that came from here.

21:45.897 --> 21:49.118
I was hoping you could help me.
We found it near an abandoned car

21:49.125 --> 21:51.493
belonging to one of our snitches.

21:54.235 --> 21:55.499
A snitch?

21:55.674 --> 21:58.204
Yeah, one of our
confidential informants.

21:58.304 --> 22:00.514
Went missing a while back.
No body yet,

22:00.523 --> 22:02.969
but we're pretty sure
he's, you know...

22:03.147 --> 22:07.084
Probably chopped up in little pieces
and fed to the buzzards.

22:09.087 --> 22:12.910
Anyway, any respirators like that
go missing lately?

22:14.421 --> 22:15.868
No. No.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.837
No, I mean, not that I know of.

22:20.012 --> 22:22.242
I'll need to take a look
at that inventory.

22:22.330 --> 22:24.846
Sure. I got a list
hanging on the wall.

22:24.999 --> 22:27.354
You mind if I take a look
at your storeroom?

22:27.467 --> 22:30.435
Not at all, no. Be my guest.

22:34.317 --> 22:35.668
Right. So who's got keys?

22:36.067 --> 22:38.559
Well, the science faculty,
the staff,

22:38.576 --> 22:41.603
Carmen, the vice principal
has the master,

22:41.609 --> 22:42.990
and me.

22:43.355 --> 22:45.088
How about students?

22:45.689 --> 22:46.695
No, no.

22:46.815 --> 22:48.368
No students have keys.

22:48.829 --> 22:50.065
I should hope not.

22:50.075 --> 22:53.071
My question is do any know
where you keep them?

22:53.678 --> 22:55.489
I don't think so. No.

22:55.519 --> 22:58.402
Besides, I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so...

22:58.464 --> 23:01.007
Walt, look, I know they're
your students, but,

23:01.331 --> 23:03.885
do not underestimate them.
Big mistake.

23:03.941 --> 23:06.064
Are there any other respirators?

23:06.134 --> 23:07.184
Uh, no.

23:07.194 --> 23:10.208
Because I'm counting six.
Inventory says eight.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.875
Glassware looking
a little sparse.

23:15.938 --> 23:17.434
- Is it?
- Yeah.

23:17.746 --> 23:21.604
You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks at least.

23:22.633 --> 23:23.809
Oh, yeah.

23:24.620 --> 23:27.995
A 5,000 milliliter round bottom.

23:28.262 --> 23:31.041
Meth heads love
to brew in this, baby.

23:32.634 --> 23:34.080
Going to answer that?

23:34.296 --> 23:36.405
No, it's just...
No, I don't...

23:36.456 --> 23:38.831
Maybe it's Skyler.
She's in trouble or something.

23:38.852 --> 23:42.768
Don't ignore it on my account.
Answer it! C'mon, I got stuff to do.

23:43.128 --> 23:44.759
- Jeez.
- Okay.

23:46.434 --> 23:47.405
Hello.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.495
Yo. What's up, Mr. W?

23:50.775 --> 23:51.953
Speaking.

23:52.055 --> 23:54.552
- Bad time to talk?
- Absolutely.

23:54.669 --> 23:56.304
All right, so just listen.

23:56.392 --> 23:59.502
You know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

23:59.634 --> 24:01.557
Turns out my boy Skinny Pete

24:01.562 --> 24:04.365
was in the same cellblock with him
over at Los Lunas.

24:04.404 --> 24:06.025
So we got our in.

24:06.126 --> 24:09.193
We're hauling a pound
to the dude right now.

24:09.775 --> 24:10.881
Okay, then.

24:10.892 --> 24:13.407
Thank you very much for calling.

24:16.567 --> 24:18.996
My doctor is very solicitous.

24:19.651 --> 24:22.622
Look, buddy, the last thing I want to do
is get you in hot water,

24:22.629 --> 24:25.834
but some meth monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

24:25.939 --> 24:28.479
You got to keep a better
watch over your turf.

24:28.543 --> 24:29.733
I will.

24:30.173 --> 24:33.667
We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

24:40.588 --> 24:41.765
Right. No.

24:42.191 --> 24:43.681
Right. Absolutely not.

24:47.462 --> 24:49.452
So you're sure you're
tight with this guy?

24:49.456 --> 24:51.713
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

25:08.696 --> 25:10.850
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete!

25:19.606 --> 25:22.599
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea, yo. Come on.

25:27.166 --> 25:29.234
Atta man.
That's what's happening.

25:42.694 --> 25:44.648
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

25:55.084 --> 25:57.739
No need, man.
Me and Tuco go back.

26:11.951 --> 26:14.820
Tuco. What's happening,
my brother?

26:21.082 --> 26:22.907
Sick crib, yo.

26:22.912 --> 26:25.168
You been keeping it real
since you been sprung.

26:25.173 --> 26:27.065
What's it been, like a year?

26:27.267 --> 26:29.078
- This your boy?
- Yeah, Jesse.

26:29.114 --> 26:31.570
The dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

26:31.616 --> 26:34.283
Hey, man.
Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

26:34.970 --> 26:36.536
Break out the ice.

26:53.228 --> 26:54.381
Take a bump.

26:54.388 --> 26:56.468
No worries, man.
I'm no cop.

26:58.226 --> 26:59.966
I said hit it.

27:02.835 --> 27:03.925
All right.

27:19.813 --> 27:23.460
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.387
- Where'd you get it?
- I cooked it.

27:29.091 --> 27:30.169
Bullshit!

27:32.540 --> 27:34.043
Who you working for?

27:34.491 --> 27:37.623
No one, man. I mean,
I have a partner that I cook with,

27:37.653 --> 27:39.176
but that's it.

27:42.045 --> 27:43.241
All right.

27:46.511 --> 27:47.802
We got a deal.

27:47.889 --> 27:50.008
See? I told you
Tuco would hook you up.

27:50.128 --> 27:50.993
Cool.

27:51.595 --> 27:53.398
I haven't said how much.

28:02.025 --> 28:04.468
All right. How much?

28:05.139 --> 28:07.192
35 large for the pound.

28:11.998 --> 28:14.528
Well, you're a little light, ese.

28:18.265 --> 28:20.674
It's all right. Don't sweat it.
It's all good.

28:20.688 --> 28:23.246
It's good.
Walk. Get out of here.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.708
- What about the money?
- You'll get it.

28:26.979 --> 28:29.284
This is a consignment operation.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.976
You want me to float 35 G's?

28:35.608 --> 28:37.221
You don't trust me?

28:37.359 --> 28:40.796
No, no. Hey, it's not that, man.
It's just, you know, I don't...

28:40.884 --> 28:42.718
I don't do business that way.

28:42.737 --> 28:45.359
Tough shit!
The deal is done!

28:47.868 --> 28:49.722
You said this was cool.

28:49.835 --> 28:51.874
Get money for meth.
Cash up front.

28:51.982 --> 28:54.919
Don't front, dude.
Tuco's good for it.

28:55.299 --> 28:58.237
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me!

29:02.589 --> 29:03.729
Come on!

29:05.222 --> 29:06.537
Oh, come on!

29:18.677 --> 29:22.661
All right, you brought me
some really clean crystal.

29:25.574 --> 29:28.141
Do you really
want your money up front?

29:51.818 --> 29:53.183
Up front.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.210
Nobody moves crystal

30:25.213 --> 30:27.916
in the South Valley but me, bitch!

30:48.805 --> 30:50.370
Good morning, Hugo.

30:51.718 --> 30:54.524
Don't mind if
I call you Hugo... Hugo.

30:58.771 --> 31:01.326
We've never had a crowd
on the street like that.

31:01.520 --> 31:03.274
Is that Uncle Hank?

31:08.649 --> 31:11.405
Uncle Hank's arresting
Mr. Archuleta.

31:12.130 --> 31:15.037
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

31:15.233 --> 31:18.716
I got two words for you:
background check. How about that?

31:20.668 --> 31:24.004
Yo, yo, yo. 148-3369,

31:24.092 --> 31:25.695
representing the ABQ.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.087
What up, biatch?

31:27.137 --> 31:28.897
Leave it at the tone.

31:29.123 --> 31:32.384
Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

31:33.028 --> 31:34.846
- Hey, Walt.
- Yeah?

31:35.523 --> 31:37.276
Hank's about to deal.

31:37.377 --> 31:39.858
Okay. I'll be right there.

31:46.364 --> 31:49.131
All right. Let's see
what the turn brings us.

31:50.522 --> 31:52.301
You're looking good, Walt.

31:52.367 --> 31:53.799
Your color's better.

31:53.814 --> 31:55.845
Yeah? Thanks.

31:55.983 --> 31:58.883
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

31:59.215 --> 32:02.800
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some time off from work, but...

32:02.812 --> 32:05.687
Well, actually, I just
talked to Carmen this morning,

32:05.725 --> 32:08.656
and they're getting
a substitute for a few weeks.

32:09.328 --> 32:12.183
I just didn't have a chance
to tell you. Sorry.

32:12.346 --> 32:13.961
Your bet, tough guy.

32:14.254 --> 32:15.281
Check.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.809
Yeah. Check.

32:18.136 --> 32:19.885
Check's in the mail.

32:20.993 --> 32:22.178
10 million.

32:22.226 --> 32:23.956
Red's 25 million.
Blue's 10.

32:23.999 --> 32:26.981
Then 25 million
because that's how I roll.

32:27.194 --> 32:30.220
Hey, Uncle Hank,
why were you arresting

32:30.333 --> 32:32.854
Mr. Archuleta the other day?

32:33.015 --> 32:34.444
He's a pretty cool guy.

32:34.468 --> 32:37.640
Well, turns out
that he has a record.

32:37.843 --> 32:40.074
Yeah. Couple
of possession beefs.

32:40.533 --> 32:44.090
We figure he was the guy that was
stealing your school's chemistry gear.

32:44.210 --> 32:46.327
I mean, you know, he had a key.

32:46.653 --> 32:48.168
Fit the profile.

32:48.368 --> 32:51.781
When we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt,

32:52.069 --> 32:55.328
which goes to prove old Huge Hugo
ain't so cool after all.

32:55.415 --> 32:56.812
It's to you, Walt.

32:56.862 --> 32:59.192
Yeah, I'll call.

32:59.772 --> 33:01.675
I can't believe the school system

33:01.690 --> 33:03.703
didn't know
about this guy's record.

33:03.730 --> 33:05.634
I mean, that's pretty scary.

33:05.690 --> 33:08.238
How could something like that
just slip through the cracks?

33:08.240 --> 33:11.078
I don't know. I mean,
for what it's worth,

33:11.453 --> 33:14.346
Hugo just doesn't strike me
as the thief.

33:14.610 --> 33:17.021
Yeah, well, nothing
personal, Walt, but

33:17.053 --> 33:20.936
you wouldn't know a criminal if he was
close enough to check you for a hernia.

33:22.821 --> 33:25.368
Now, that said,
we got a search warrant,

33:25.377 --> 33:27.619
and we tore
old Hugo's house apart.

33:27.691 --> 33:30.271
Turns out he's
a major league pothead.

33:30.553 --> 33:33.448
But he didn't
raid your chemistry set.

33:33.523 --> 33:35.139
You hiding something?

33:41.457 --> 33:42.457
I'm in.

33:42.505 --> 33:44.836
And the river card.

33:47.381 --> 33:49.448
Yeah, I got nothing.
I'm out.

33:49.848 --> 33:50.800
I'm out.

33:54.382 --> 33:55.347
Yowsa!

33:56.206 --> 33:59.904
When old "holes in her purse" bails,
you know you're in deep.

34:00.362 --> 34:02.829
Looks like it's
you and me, buddy.

34:03.682 --> 34:05.930
What's going to happen
to him? Hugo.

34:06.530 --> 34:09.996
Well, I mean, he's going to lose
his job, like he should.

34:10.247 --> 34:14.155
Probably spend a couple months
in County, as it's not his first rap.

34:15.691 --> 34:17.356
I'm waiting.

34:19.795 --> 34:22.266
You going to man up,
or you're going to puss out?

34:22.329 --> 34:23.143
Hank.

34:24.815 --> 34:26.130
What? Sorry.

34:30.187 --> 34:31.439
I'm all in.

34:35.079 --> 34:35.843
No.

34:36.874 --> 34:40.807
You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.

34:42.213 --> 34:44.229
What are you smoking there, huh?

34:45.632 --> 34:48.613
You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

34:52.800 --> 34:55.940
Nope. Not falling for it,
buddy. I fold.

34:57.832 --> 34:59.779
Talk about anti-climactic.

34:59.788 --> 35:02.410
Your cards couldn't
have been that bad.

35:02.484 --> 35:05.412
Oh, my God.
You threw away an ace...

35:05.437 --> 35:08.798
- What are you doing? Don't.
- ...and a cowboy, for...

35:13.922 --> 35:15.801
A handful of nothing.

36:16.865 --> 36:18.155
Who is this?

36:18.431 --> 36:20.385
I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.

36:23.583 --> 36:25.524
Well, where is he, then?

36:40.068 --> 36:41.358
You the guy?

36:42.213 --> 36:43.991
Yeah, I'm the guy.

36:49.606 --> 36:50.879
How is he?

36:52.122 --> 36:54.546
Got some busted ribs
and like that.

36:55.955 --> 36:58.122
Got messed up pretty good.

36:58.370 --> 37:01.225
I was all like
"Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."

37:03.092 --> 37:05.896
I don't know what got into him.
Seriously.

37:08.511 --> 37:11.038
Oh, he's out, man, way out.

37:11.850 --> 37:14.229
They got him doped up
big-time.

37:19.994 --> 37:22.074
So you're the cook, huh?

37:23.799 --> 37:25.890
Yo, I didn't catch your name.

37:39.998 --> 37:42.115
Tell me about this Tuco.

37:43.211 --> 37:45.438
Tell me everything about him.

39:28.937 --> 39:30.164
Good morning.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.249
Would you
pass the butter, please?

39:37.657 --> 39:39.273
Bad ass, Dad.

40:32.403 --> 40:33.665
You Tuco?

40:39.141 --> 40:42.660
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

42:07.513 --> 42:09.010
What's your name?

42:09.807 --> 42:11.335
Heisenberg.

42:11.609 --> 42:13.100
Heisenberg.

42:14.105 --> 42:14.970
Okay.

42:15.778 --> 42:17.820
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

42:18.641 --> 42:21.326
I don't imagine
I'll be here very long.

42:21.447 --> 42:22.748
No?

42:23.834 --> 42:25.024
All right.

42:27.017 --> 42:28.294
Be that way.

42:30.873 --> 42:32.515
It's your meeting.

42:32.610 --> 42:36.041
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

42:37.045 --> 42:38.511
$50,000.

42:40.814 --> 42:43.256
Oh, man! 50 G's?

42:43.635 --> 42:44.980
How you figure that?

42:44.985 --> 42:47.456
35 for the pound
of meth you stole

42:47.606 --> 42:50.812
and another 15 for my partner's
pain and suffering.

42:56.387 --> 42:57.364
Partner.

43:04.628 --> 43:07.909
Oh, yeah. I remember
that little bitch.

43:08.890 --> 43:10.930
So you must be Daddy.

43:19.562 --> 43:21.378
Let me get this straight.

43:23.246 --> 43:25.651
I steal your dope, hmm?

43:26.351 --> 43:30.233
I beat the piss
out of your mule boy!

43:31.032 --> 43:34.966
And then you walk in here,
and you bring me more meth?

43:38.863 --> 43:41.139
That's a brilliant plan, ese.

43:41.265 --> 43:42.329
Brilliant.

43:44.052 --> 43:46.331
You got one part of that wrong.

43:50.897 --> 43:53.353
This is not meth.

44:21.063 --> 44:22.516
Are you nuts?

44:22.731 --> 44:24.446
You want to find out?

44:25.149 --> 44:27.413
No-Doze, Gonzo, calma!

44:27.772 --> 44:29.620
Calma. Calma.

44:32.251 --> 44:33.881
You got balls.

44:34.215 --> 44:35.744
I'll give you that.

44:35.869 --> 44:37.418
All right. All right.

44:37.643 --> 44:39.472
I'll give you your money.

44:43.440 --> 44:47.403
That crystal that your
partner brought me,

44:48.378 --> 44:50.338
it sold faster

44:50.840 --> 44:53.001
than $10 ass in TJ.

44:56.978 --> 44:58.807
What say you bring me

44:59.208 --> 45:01.075
another pound next week?

45:04.289 --> 45:05.871
Money up front.

45:06.180 --> 45:07.219
All right.

45:08.738 --> 45:10.340
Money up front.

45:14.933 --> 45:18.001
Sometimes you got to rob
to keep your riches.

45:19.625 --> 45:22.518
Just as long as we
got an understanding.

45:25.379 --> 45:27.606
One pound is not going to cut it.

45:27.847 --> 45:29.654
You have to take two.

45:36.262 --> 45:37.414
Orale.

45:40.548 --> 45:41.913
What is that shit?

45:43.923 --> 45:45.889
Fulminated mercury.

45:47.226 --> 45:49.531
A little tweak of chemistry.
