2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,502
<i>Let's break it down.</i>

3
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,964
Hydrogen. What does that give us?

4
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:53,967
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.

5
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:56,261
Sixty-three?

6
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,888
That is a big bite.

7
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:01,225
- My next step's gotta be oxygen.
- Oxygen, 26 percent.

8
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,602
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.

9
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,189
- Carbon, 9 percent.
- Carbon, 9.

10
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:10,317
- For a total of 98 percent.
- Right.

11
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:14,780
- Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.
- One-point-two-five.

12
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:17,282
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.

13
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,452
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements...

14
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:23,205
...down where the magic happens.

15
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:27,167
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.

16
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,169
Got a whole skeleton to account for.

17
00:01:29,378 --> 00:01:31,046
- You would think, right?
- Right.

18
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:34,800
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.

19
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,722
What? That low? Seriously?

20
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,640
Damn, I never would've thought that.

21
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,645
- Okay, so where does iron fit in?
- Iron.

22
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:53,694
Well, okay, 0.00004 percent.

23
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:57,781
What? You can't have
hemoglobin without iron.

24
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,826
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No doubt. Go figure.

25
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:04,872
- Sodium.
- Sodium, 0.04.

26
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:11,795
- Phosphorus, 0.19.
- Point-one-nine.

27
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:13,922
There we go.

28
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:17,926
So the whole thing...

29
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:24,558
...adds up to 99.888042 percent.

30
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,608
We are 0.111958 percent...

31
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,943
...shy.

32
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:38,781
- Supposedly, that's everything.
- Yeah?

33
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:41,950
I don't know, I just...

34
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:45,704
It seems like something's missing,
doesn't it?

35
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:51,960
There's got to be more
to a human being than that.

36
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,035
I hate these shoes.

37
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:27,955
Shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans...

38
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,999
...like I should be squeaking around...

39
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:32,793
...bringing soup to some
disgusting old person...

40
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:34,962
...then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

41
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,381
Then why are you wearing them?

42
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:41,885
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely archy.

43
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:50,686
Yo, what's up? Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes? Thanks, bye.

44
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:54,773
I gotta go take this.

45
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:57,484
Female?

46
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:00,738
Louis.

47
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:04,408
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

48
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:06,577
- Just be quick about it.
- No.

49
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:11,165
Oh, and please don't say, "Yo."

50
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:14,126
You can't know how much I hate that.

51
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,926
You missed a spot, right there.

52
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:24,803
Should you be on that ladder?

53
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:27,473
You're more than welcome
to take over for me in here.

54
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,892
I don't see why you don't get
Walt to do it.

55
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:33,312
Yeah, there's an idea.

56
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:38,317
So I'm working on
this new short story...

57
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:43,113
...and there's this stoner character in it
and I'm trying to...

58
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,533
Well, you know, actually,
let me back up.

59
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:52,289
You smoked your fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

60
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,044
I mean, you at least tried it.

61
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:00,964
Come on.

62
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:06,970
I perhaps tried it. Why?

63
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,473
Do you remember it
having an effect on your mood?

64
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,767
Like, changing it in any major way?

65
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:14,603
It made me more serious.

66
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,480
Really?

67
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:21,985
Because I mostly remember it made me
light-headed, that's about it.

68
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:26,949
I was just wondering
if it maybe could...

69
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:34,289
You know, it's just a character thing
I'm stuck on. Never mind.

70
00:05:34,498 --> 00:05:37,584
- Walter Jr.'s on pot?
- What? No.

71
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,461
No. No.

72
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,214
- What would make you even...?
- Where's he getting it?

73
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:45,884
- Marie.
- Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

74
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:50,431
- What are you gonna do about this?
- Marie, you need to look me in the eye.

75
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,518
I am strictly asking about a story
that I'm writing, that's all.

76
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:59,273
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. Is not on pot...

77
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:02,317
...certainly not as far as I know.

78
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:04,987
Not as far as you know?

79
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,072
Marie.

80
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:56,098
Hey, look at me.

81
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:59,893
Hey, turn around and look at me.

82
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:08,318
This here.

83
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:11,488
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

84
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:15,451
This is degrading.

85
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:21,874
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,919
You hope I'll make it easy
and just drop dead, don't you?

87
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:29,214
But I won't.

88
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:31,842
So either kill me, or let me go.

89
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:35,637
You don't have it in you, Walter.

90
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:41,435
How do you know my name?

91
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:47,024
Jesse. He told Emilio and me.

92
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,319
I came by to sell your meth.

93
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:54,990
So what? You threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?

94
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:57,201
Not even close.

95
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:02,956
What else did he tell you?

96
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,086
Pretty much everything
he could think of.

97
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:09,546
You were his high school teacher.

98
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,757
One time you taught
about carbon dioxide...

99
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:14,510
...by making grape soda in class.

100
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,972
You have a son who's retarded,
or in a wheelchair or something.

101
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:24,436
It shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

102
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:26,814
That partner of yours...

103
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:28,148
...he's got a big mouth.

104
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,694
Walter...

105
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:34,363
...I don't know what you think
you're doing here...

106
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:36,240
...but trust me...

107
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:39,576
...this line of work doesn't suit you.

108
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:44,915
So I should just let you go, then.

109
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:49,628
Just unlock you and... adiós, huh?

110
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,589
I don't see
what other choice you have.

111
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:55,634
It's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

112
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:57,886
Besides...

113
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:01,056
...your real problem's
sitting upstairs.

114
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,119
Occupied.

115
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:25,331
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off
in here.

116
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:27,583
Just give me some privacy,
would you?

117
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,505
- Okay.
- What the hell, man?

118
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,383
What are you doing, man?

119
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:38,844
- You asshole. What...?
- You told him my name.

120
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,138
- Says who, him?
- My name, where I work.

121
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:43,724
- You told him about my son.
- Hey, don't touch me.

122
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:46,518
- You damn junkie.
- No, give me that. That's mine.

123
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,854
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.

124
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,564
No, that's worth 40 grand, you...

125
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:53,484
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

126
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:55,652
Get off the toilet.

127
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:57,654
- Get off the toilet!
- No.

128
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,785
Get off the toilet.

129
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:05,245
Stop it.

130
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:10,000
No. No way.

131
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:45,786
No.

132
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:47,955
No, no, no.

133
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,708
Jesse, where the hell do you think
you're going?

134
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,251
Back off, man, Jesus.

135
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,919
- We've got work to do.
- No, no.

136
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:56,630
You got work to do. I did my part.

137
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,299
You mean that obscenity
I spent hours cleaning up?

138
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:02,386
- That is your contribution?
- Kiss my pink ass, man.

139
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:05,889
I didn't ask for any of this. How am I
supposed to live here now, huh?

140
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:08,684
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

141
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:11,979
Because you didn't follow
my instructions.

142
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:13,897
Oh, well, <i>Heil Hitler</i>, bitch.

143
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:16,358
And let me tell you something else.

144
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,361
We flipped a coin, okay?

145
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,114
You and me. You and me.

146
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:24,616
Coin flip is sacred.

147
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:37,421
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement...

148
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,840
...as per the coin.

149
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:41,550
Fucking do it, already.

150
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:59,485
That's what she said. Yeah.

151
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:02,863
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we have some of those.

152
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:05,532
- Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
- Hello?

153
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,202
- Seven and a half, maybe. I don't know.
- Excuse me.

154
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,828
Do you have these in black?

155
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:13,999
Anyways, so like I was saying...

156
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,544
...I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.

157
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:22,675
Whatever.

158
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:25,511
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

159
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:28,180
<i>Sorry, baby, I'm kind of busy here.
What's up?</i>

160
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:32,601
Well, kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject.

161
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,648
- So I need you to focus, and...
<i>- Hey, sit down! Sit down!</i>

162
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:39,942
Damn it, Hank.

163
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,903
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle
of something here.

164
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:44,947
Get down. Get down.

165
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:48,867
Sit down! Sit your ass down,
<i>comprende?</i> You too, sit down!

166
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:56,333
I'm back, babe. What's up?

167
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:59,878
- Walter Jr.
<i>- Yeah, what about him?</i>

168
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:03,674
Marijuana. He's smoking it.

169
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:06,051
<i>Excuse me, his own mother
seems to think so.</i>

170
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,178
- Skyler told you that?
<i>- She inferred it.</i>

171
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:09,680
She inferred it, huh?

172
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:12,683
She strongly inferred it.

173
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:18,439
Like, " Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction."

174
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,190
<i>- Please, come on.</i>
- All right.

175
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,526
- Talk to him.
<i>- Walt should talk to him.</i>

176
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,695
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.

177
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:26,989
<i>I think it ought to be you.</i>

178
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,199
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

179
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:32,119
Maybe show him
some autopsy pictures.

180
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:34,163
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.

181
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:36,707
I don't know, baby,
it's just that, you know...

182
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:40,085
...I figure his dad should be the one
doing this, don't you think?

183
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,546
Hank, he respects you.

184
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:49,803
Yeah, all right. Well, listen, yeah,
I'll swing by their place after work.

185
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:52,723
- Good. Scare him straight.
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

186
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:54,516
Hey, where's my sugar?

187
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:00,981
Excuse me, ma'am.

188
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,401
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

189
00:15:04,943 --> 00:15:06,528
I'm extremely clean.

190
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:09,740
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.

191
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:14,703
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

192
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:18,123
You know, I hid a pair for you
last week, gray ones.

193
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:12,302
- What do you think?
- About what?

194
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:14,805
This look like a nice place?

195
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:17,808
No, not really.

196
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:20,019
Think you'd like to live here?

197
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,021
No.

198
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:25,107
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

199
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:28,402
I thought we were going to
Cold Stone Creamery.

200
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,155
Yeah, yeah, well,
we took a little detour.

201
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:34,408
Figure we'll come over
and check out how the other half lives.

202
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:37,119
This here is what we call
the Crystal Palace.

203
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:40,080
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

204
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:43,083
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads...

205
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:47,254
...who'd sell their grandma's coochie
for a hit.

206
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:49,923
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

207
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:52,426
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these...

208
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:56,930
...miserable wastes of skin
got started how?

209
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:59,350
- How do you think they started?
- I don't know.

210
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:02,353
What do you think they were doing
before they graduated...

211
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:05,230
...to shooting meth in their dicks?

212
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,692
A gateway drug.

213
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,611
That's what we call it.

214
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,155
Dollars to doughnuts,
and I shit you not...

215
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:17,242
...that gateway drug was marijuana,
every time.

216
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:19,453
- You understand?
- Yeah.

217
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:22,706
So why are you telling me this?

218
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,542
Because I love you,
you little bastard.

219
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:28,837
And, hey, I was young once,
you know.

220
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:32,633
The world's a messed up place,
you know.

221
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:36,178
You know, just this one time,
you know...

222
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:39,390
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

223
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:43,477
Yeah, you, princess. Get over here.

224
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:48,691
Hey, don't make me
get out of the car.

225
00:17:53,112 --> 00:17:54,405
Check this out.

226
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:56,657
What I'm talking about.

227
00:17:57,741 --> 00:18:00,160
- I ain't holding, okay?
- Did I say open your mouth?

228
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:02,246
And hands off the car.

229
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:06,333
Other side. Go around the other side,
talk to my friend here.

230
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:11,380
What's your name, sweetheart?

231
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,383
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?

232
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:16,719
How much you charge
for a windy, Wendy?

233
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:20,139
- I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?

234
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:23,100
Don't think so hard,
it's gonna hurt your brain.

235
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:26,186
- Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
- Nothing. Neither.

236
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:28,564
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?

237
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:31,650
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

238
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:37,323
Oh, God. See that? Pipe, definitely.

239
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,158
Big time, big time on the pipe.

240
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,452
You got something
you wanna ask Wendy?

241
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,245
No, not really.

242
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:45,581
You ever smoke anything else,
Wendy?

243
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,334
Sausages don't count.

244
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:52,921
Seriously, tell my friend here
how you got started.

245
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,925
Probably used to be, what? Like a
Girl Scout, or sang in the church choir.

246
00:18:57,134 --> 00:19:01,180
- What are you, like, handicapped?
- He broke his leg playing football.

247
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:05,059
He's a qb. Got an arm like a howitzer.

248
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:09,271
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?

249
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,606
Why, you got some?

250
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:13,442
No. Right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.

251
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,904
Hey, fair warning, next time
I'm gonna bust you.

252
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:25,704
So, what do you think?

253
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:28,957
Cool.

254
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:41,929
Shut the door. Shut the door.
Lock it. Lock it, lock it.

255
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,972
Who the hell was that?

256
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:46,934
Cop and some football player
messing with me.

257
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:49,395
They ask about me, huh?

258
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:52,106
No, I think they just wanted pot.

259
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,705
Right there.

260
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,417
Shit, I left my root beer.

261
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:03,677
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.

262
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:05,679
Listen, I'm so sorry.

263
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:11,101
Time, it just completely got away
from me. I'm just...

264
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:16,065
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late...

265
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:18,859
...you know, doing some inventory...

266
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:21,654
...and I should've just...

267
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:26,992
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, "No."

268
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:29,203
But...

269
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:32,998
Sky? You there?

270
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,502
<i>You're at the car wash?</i>

271
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,088
Yeah.

272
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,885
I seriously doubt that,
since you quit two weeks ago.

273
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:54,395
I called Bogdan, looking for you.

274
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:57,022
Quite an earful he gave me.

275
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,901
Listen...

276
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:04,780
Listen, I'll come home
and we'll talk about it.

277
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:08,784
- I don't think so, Walt.
<i>- Honey...</i>

278
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:10,995
Wherever you are...

279
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,873
...why don't you just
stay there tonight?

280
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:20,963
Skyler?

281
00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:24,758
<i>Walter?</i>

282
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:26,593
Hello?

283
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:29,596
Hey, there's a hungry guy here.

284
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:09,863
Come on.

285
00:24:32,302 --> 00:24:33,929
Damn.

286
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,807
I didn't think you were coming back.

287
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:52,740
How long was I out?

288
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:55,659
Ten, 15 minutes?

289
00:24:57,661 --> 00:25:01,290
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

290
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,542
Were you on the same shit
you used on me?

291
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:13,927
I've got lung cancer.

292
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:41,205
I'll make you another sandwich.

293
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:19,910
It's safe.

294
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:22,913
There's no poison.

295
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,210
Because that would be
the way to do it...

296
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,963
...if you're gonna do it.

297
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,466
I suppose it would.

298
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,846
You being a chemist and all.

299
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,950
So that name...

300
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:02,536
...Krazy-8.

301
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:04,955
Do I really have to call you that?

302
00:27:05,164 --> 00:27:07,750
I mean, no offense, but...

303
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:10,252
...don't you have a real name?

304
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:13,255
Domingo.

305
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,008
Domingo.

306
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,969
That's "Sunday," right?

307
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,309
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

308
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,647
I can't say I ever liked it much.

309
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:36,862
So, Domingo...

310
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:40,908
...you from around town here
or someplace else?

311
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:43,285
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me...

312
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:46,538
...is not gonna make it easier
for you to kill me.

313
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,832
Not that I mind, you understand?

314
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:54,922
You know, you keep telling me
that I don't have it in me.

315
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,799
Well, maybe.

316
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,176
But maybe not.

317
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:05,057
I sure as hell am looking for
any reason not to.

318
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:08,686
I mean, any good reason at all.

319
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,944
Sell me.

320
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:19,196
Tell me what it is.

321
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:25,244
I'd start off by promising
that if you let me go...

322
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:28,789
...I won't come after you,
that you'd be safe.

323
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,000
I guess I'd say
what happened between us...

324
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:33,335
...never happened.

325
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:37,214
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

326
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:41,593
But you know anybody in my situation
would make promises like that.

327
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:44,179
And, in my case,
they happen to be true.

328
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:45,848
You'll never know for sure.

329
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:52,062
So, what else can I tell you?

330
00:28:57,943 --> 00:28:59,820
I don't know.

331
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:03,741
But you've gotta convince me.

332
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:08,537
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

333
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:12,082
- Hey, yeah.
- Yeah.

334
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:14,543
I'm from here in town, man.

335
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,880
ABQ, born and bred.

336
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:20,007
Never left.

337
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:23,886
Studied Business Administration
over at UNM...

338
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:25,304
...got my degree.

339
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:28,223
Really?

340
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:34,396
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

341
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:36,398
Doesn't hurt.

342
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:39,985
I was gonna study music originally.

343
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:43,197
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin and Berklee.

344
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:46,659
My pops talked me out of it.

345
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:50,746
Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star...

346
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:53,916
...and I hadn't a snowball chance
at that one.

347
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:57,127
What does your dad do?

348
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,465
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.

349
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:05,135
Wait a minute, I know that place.

350
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,556
Wait a minute. That's...

351
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:12,142
That's that...

352
00:30:12,351 --> 00:30:14,728
They used to have those late-night...

353
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:17,189
- The stupid commercials.
- That they had, yeah.

354
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,526
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.

355
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:24,405
Wait a minute.
How did it go? It was...

356
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:27,449
Wait, wait, wait. It was...

357
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:33,205
<i>Don't let shopping
Strain your brain-o</i>

358
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:37,126
<i>Just sing this short refrain-o</i>

359
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:40,504
<i>- Our furniture is</i> bueno
<i>- Our furniture is</i> bueno

360
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,299
<i>- Tampico is the name-o
- Tampico is the name-o</i>

361
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:57,896
Pretty moronic. But what can you do?

362
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:01,817
Well, it did tend
to stick in your head.

363
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,779
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.

364
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:09,950
Oh, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

365
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,411
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

366
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:17,958
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven. "'

367
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,172
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I...

368
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:28,552
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

369
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,930
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.

370
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:33,349
We did use to sell cribs.

371
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:38,145
A crib, then, okay. A crib.

372
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,481
Yeah. No, I remember that.

373
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:46,737
In fact, I remember recognizing
your dad from those commercials.

374
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:50,366
Although, he wasn't anywhere near
as friendly in real life.

375
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:52,493
Yeah. No shit.

376
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:55,204
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

377
00:31:55,704 --> 00:31:57,665
Yeah, he probably did.

378
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:00,250
And I was probably dumb enough
to buy it.

379
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:02,378
Yeah, that was his big thing.

380
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,213
You ask him for a glass of water...

381
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:07,383
...he'd tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

382
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,806
- Did you work there too?
- Only my whole life.

383
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:16,934
Up until the day I said,
"Fuck you," and quit.

384
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:23,023
So...

385
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,569
...16 years ago,
how old would you have been?

386
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,907
If it was after school,
trust me, I was there.

387
00:32:32,157 --> 00:32:34,159
Might have even helped ring you up.

388
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:38,080
You and your extended warranty
on the crib.

389
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,757
Small world.

390
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:52,011
It is.

391
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:55,973
The paths we take, huh?

392
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,959
Jesse know you've got cancer?

393
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,964
No one but you.

394
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,218
- Not your family?
- No.

395
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:36,638
Why not?

396
00:33:40,392 --> 00:33:45,272
Not a conversation
that I'm even remotely ready to have.

397
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,610
That's why you're cooking meth?

398
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,905
You wanna leave money
for your family.

399
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,659
Hell.

400
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,662
I'll write you a check right now
if you let me go.

401
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:07,544
Like I said, Walter...

402
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,131
...if this line of work
doesn't suit you...

403
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:18,138
...get out before it's too late.

404
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:26,939
I don't know what to do.

405
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:38,325
You do.

406
00:34:57,511 --> 00:34:59,680
I'll get the key.

407
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,325
No.

408
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,452
No.

409
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,330
Oh, no, no, no.

410
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:02,428
No. No, don't do this.

411
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:05,889
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

412
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,226
Why are you doing this?

413
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:44,553
You're doing the right thing, Walter.

414
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:53,520
Do you wanna?

415
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,164
So you're not angry?

416
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,669
Angry at you?

417
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,256
Live and let live, man.

418
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,636
That's very understanding.

419
00:38:25,844 --> 00:38:27,680
Whatever, man.

420
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,015
I just wanna go home.

421
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,690
Me too.

422
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,574
Unlock me, Walter.

423
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,467
The moment I do...

424
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:10,014
...are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

425
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,627
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

426
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,671
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

427
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,675
I'm sorry.

428
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,642
I'm sorry.

429
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:58,145
I'm so sorry.

430
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,777
Hello?

431
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,114
Anybody down here?

432
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,600
Everybody...

433
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,187
...I need you all to take your seats.

434
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,190
Settle down, please. Thank you.

435
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,151
I understand
that Mr. White is feeling...

436
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,946
...a little under the weather
this morning.

437
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:59,118
So you folks are going to have
to be making do with me today.

438
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:03,580
And we are going to be watching
a very interesting video...

439
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:07,251
...on carbon.

440
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,711
Very important stuff.

441
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:15,801
- So, what do you think?
- It's a cook site. Gotta be.

442
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,263
Nobody came way the hell out here
just to buy.

443
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,224
Fire there could have started
by accident.

444
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,935
I don't think that was meant
to destroy evidence.

445
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,981
Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

446
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:32,443
So, what, they're in
some sort of camper-slash-lab?

447
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,696
They accidentally start a fire
and everybody FOs?

448
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,573
Yeah. Why not?

449
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,868
So why did that little hair-gelled shit
leave his car?

450
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:49,126
- Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
- It's a rich and vibrant culture.

451
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,587
It's a car that jumps up and down.

452
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,255
What the hell?

453
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,592
You people used to be conquistadors,
for chrissake.

454
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,888
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

455
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,848
I already searched it.

456
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,184
Yeah.

457
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,103
You're wasting your time.

458
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,940
Give it up. If this here's a trap car,
it's gonna take more...

459
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,818
- ...than your dumb white ass to find it.
- Oh, yeah?

460
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,989
You are talking to the trap-car master,
my friend.

461
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,492
I'm Rain Man counting
his toothpicks.

462
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,578
Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded.

463
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,629
Yeah, baby.

464
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,386
- Hello, zippy.
- Asshole.

465
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:45,099
Sort of looks like meth
but it's too damn white.

466
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,395
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?

467
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,314
Yep. Somebody croaked our snitch.

468
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,983
Hey, agent.

469
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,026
You got something?

470
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,646
<i>I don't know.</i>

471
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,066
It just... Doesn't it seem like...

472
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,902
...something's missing?

473
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,196
What about the soul?

474
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,127
The soul.

475
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,512
There's nothing but chemistry here.

476
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,454
Skyler?

477
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,883
There's something I have to tell you.
