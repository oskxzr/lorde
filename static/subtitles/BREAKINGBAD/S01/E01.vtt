WEBVTT

01:09.236 --> 01:12.780
Oh, my God. Christ!

01:15.993 --> 01:18.661
Shit.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.378
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.840
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Think, think, think.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.511
Oh, my gosh.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.210
Okay. Come on,
come on, come on.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.212
Come on.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.302
My name is
Walter Hartwell White.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.222
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

02:19.389 --> 02:21.974
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.476
To all law-enforcement entities,

02:23.644 --> 02:26.020
this is not an admission
of guilt.

02:26.188 --> 02:29.649
I am speaking to my family now.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.907
Skyler.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.243
You are the love of my life.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.370
I hope you know that.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.915
Walter Jr.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.334
You're my big man.

02:48.502 --> 02:53.089
There are... There are going
to be some things...

02:53.257 --> 02:55.925
Things that you'll
come to learn about me

02:56.093 --> 02:57.802
in the next few days.

02:57.970 --> 03:03.307
I just want you to know
that no matter how it may look

03:03.475 --> 03:06.269
I only had you in my heart.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.485
Goodbye.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.898
Money before the panel
earlier this year.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.566
Happy birthday.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.902
Oh.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.320
Look at that.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.657
That is veggie bacon.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.575
Believe it or not.
Zero cholesterol

05:26.743 --> 05:28.661
and you won't even
taste the difference.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.079
Mm.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.747
What time do you think
you'll be home?

05:31.915 --> 05:32.957
Same time.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.584
I don't want him
dicking you around tonight.

05:35.752 --> 05:39.422
You get paid till 5,
you work till 5. No later.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.965
Aha.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.259
Hey.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.511
Hey, happy birthday.
Well, thank you.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.596
You're late again.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.349
There was no hot water again.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.393
I have an easy fix
for that.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.894
You wake up early,

05:54.062 --> 05:57.148
and then you get to be the first
person in the shower. Hm.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.025
I have an idea.

06:00.986 --> 06:04.447
How about buy
a new hot-water heater?

06:04.614 --> 06:09.201
How's that idea?
For the million-billionth time.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.164
Did you take your echinacea?

06:13.331 --> 06:14.373
Yeah.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.459
I think it's getting better.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.128
What the hell is this?

06:19.296 --> 06:20.504
Hey.
It's veggie bacon.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.632
We're watching our cholesterol,
I guess.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.470
Not me. I want real bacon.
Not this fake crap.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.305
Too bad. Eat it.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.975
Phew.
This smells like Band-Aids.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.019
Eat it.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.359
So how does it feel to be old?

06:42.527 --> 06:44.320
How does it feel
to be a smart-ass?

06:44.488 --> 06:46.989
Heh. Good.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.242
Eat your veggie bacon.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.930
You're all set?
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.432
All right, see you at home.
Okay, see you.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.438
Chemistry.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.399
It is the study of what?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.152
Anyone?

07:26.530 --> 07:28.906
Ben.
Chemicals.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.866
Chemicals.

07:31.034 --> 07:33.452
No.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.080
Chemistry is...

07:36.248 --> 07:41.460
Well, technically, chemistry
is the study of matter.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.755
But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.550
Now, just...
Just think about this.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.301
Electrons.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.554
They

07:51.721 --> 07:53.222
change their energy levels.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.266
Molecules.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.686
Molecules change their bonds.

07:58.854 --> 08:03.607
Elements. They combine
and change into compounds.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.443
Well, that's...
That's all of life, right?

08:06.611 --> 08:09.238
I mean, it's just...
It's the constant, it's the cycle.

08:09.406 --> 08:14.243
It's solution, dissolution,
just over and over and over.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.829
It is growth, then decay,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.373
then transformation.

08:21.751 --> 08:25.254
It is fascinating, really.

08:30.594 --> 08:31.760
Chad.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.098
Is there something wrong
with your table?

08:38.268 --> 08:40.477
Okay, ionic bonds.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.656
Are you done?

08:54.784 --> 08:58.495
Ionic bonds. Chapter six.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.343
One, two, three makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.719
There's your receipt.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.305
Just hand this claiming disc
to your car-wash professional.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.266
Thank you. Come again.

09:29.986 --> 09:33.656
He's not coming.
He says he quits.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.407
I'm gonna run the register.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.327
Bogdan, no.
We talked about this.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.080
I'm short-handed, Walter.
What am I to do?

09:43.792 --> 09:46.001
Walter?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.879
What am I to do?

10:08.608 --> 10:12.027
Hey, Mr. White.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.904
Make those tires shine, huh?

10:14.072 --> 10:16.031
Oh, my God.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.784
You will not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.828
Mr. White.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.288
From chemistry.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.560
Surprise!

10:44.728 --> 10:46.145
Happy birthday, Dad.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.564
Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.485
Oh, you're so very late.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.321
Really, I'm serious, Skyler.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.614
I mean, you're flat
as a washboard.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.326
Oh.
You look awesome.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.369
She's not showing at all,
is she?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.413
She's showing a little.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.250
Carmen, this is my sister,
Marie.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.502
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.631
Glock 22,
that's my daily carry, okay?

11:14.799 --> 11:17.634
I mean, unless you're talking,
what, Plus P Plus loads,

11:17.802 --> 11:19.428
you can forget the 9 mil,
all right?

11:19.596 --> 11:22.431
Shit, I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

11:22.599 --> 11:23.932
Yeah, with you shooting.
Hey.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.602
If you're gonna bring a gun,
baby,

11:26.770 --> 11:28.145
you gotta bring enough gun.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.355
Forty caliber.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.939
Uh...

11:31.107 --> 11:32.691
This is awesome.
Nice, isn't it?

11:32.859 --> 11:35.652
Yeah. Dad,
come check this out.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.862
Yeah, I see it.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.448
Come on, take it.
-Yeah. Check it out, Walt.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.200
Ooh.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.077
No, no, it's just heavy.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.453
That's why they hire men.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.040
Hey, it's not gonna bite you.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.918
Looks like Keith Richards with a
glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.798
Hey, Walt. Everybody, listen
up, listen up, listen up.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.007
I'm gonna give a toast,

11:57.175 --> 11:59.760
a little toast to my
brother-in-law. Come here.

11:59.928 --> 12:04.139
Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin

12:04.307 --> 12:06.058
but we're not gonna hold that
against you.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.436
But your heart's
in the right place, man.

12:09.604 --> 12:12.147
Your heart's in the right place.
We love you, man. We love you.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.857
Everybody, to Walt.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.157
Oh, shit. Turn on channel three.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.828
At which point, we apprehended
three individuals

12:25.995 --> 12:27.955
and placed them into custody.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.666
I'm proud to say
the outstanding professionalism

12:30.834 --> 12:34.169
of my fellow agents at the
Albuquerque District Office

12:34.337 --> 12:37.005
resulted in a substantial
amount of methamphetamine

12:37.173 --> 12:38.674
being taken off the streets.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.634
Were any shots fired?
-No, ma'am.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.469
Our agents took the suspects
by surprise.

12:42.637 --> 12:45.556
Damn. The TV does add 10 pounds.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.057
Ten pounds?

12:47.225 --> 12:49.852
Hey, sit and spin, both of you.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.521
Hank.
What?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.982
Sorry. You didn't see that.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.650
So charming.

12:56.818 --> 13:00.362
Clearly an ongoing operation.
-One which was well-organized...

13:00.530 --> 13:02.948
Hank, how much money is that?
-It's about 700 grand.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.533
It was a pretty good haul.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.785
As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens of Albuquerque

13:06.953 --> 13:08.203
Wow.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.081
When we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.334
Well, that's unusual, isn't it?
That kind of cash?

13:14.502 --> 13:16.420
Mm. Well, it's not the most
we ever took.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.881
It's easy money,
till we catch you.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.382
Heh-heh.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.885
Walt, just say the word and
I'll take you on a ride-along.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.220
You can watch us knock
down a meth lab, huh?

13:25.388 --> 13:27.890
Get a little excitement
in your life.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.809
Yeah, someday.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.320
Which one's this?

13:41.488 --> 13:44.573
Um, that faux-Lalique vase
I picked up at the Super-Swap.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.325
Oh.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.788
How's it doing?

13:51.956 --> 13:55.250
Well, I met my reserve
and there's still two minutes.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.377
Oh.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.968
What's up?

14:05.136 --> 14:07.429
You tell me, birthday boy.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.226
Oh, hey, so, what's up
for Saturday?

14:12.393 --> 14:16.355
Mm. Car wash.
Bogdan says he needs me.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.023
Till what time?
Noon, 1-ish?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.859
Probably 2, more like it.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.946
And then what after that?

14:24.113 --> 14:27.282
Um, actually,

14:27.450 --> 14:30.285
ahem, I was thinking of
driving up to Los Alamos.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.870
They've got this...

14:32.038 --> 14:33.455
The visitor center
has an exhibit on

14:33.623 --> 14:35.958
that's really supposed to be...

14:36.125 --> 14:39.294
You're not gonna paint?
No, I'll paint.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.964
It's just that this...

14:42.131 --> 14:43.590
You know, this exhibition

14:43.758 --> 14:47.719
on the Mars-rover
photographs are...

14:47.887 --> 14:51.139
I mean, the detail really is
just supposed to be amazing.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.976
It's just that I really need you
to paint at some point.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.103
The sooner that back bedroom
gets finished...

14:56.271 --> 14:57.521
I know.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.816
And I'd do it myself, except you said you
don't want me standing on the stepladder.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.318
I will paint.
Okay.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.324
What is going on down there?
No, it's...

15:09.492 --> 15:11.118
Is he asleep?

15:11.286 --> 15:12.703
No, it's...

15:12.870 --> 15:15.497
No, it's nothing. He's just...

15:15.665 --> 15:18.834
You know. Well, you gotta be
careful about the baby and...

15:19.002 --> 15:22.254
Well, don't worry about
the baby. This is just for you.

15:22.422 --> 15:26.717
We are just doing you tonight.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.928
So just close your eyes,

15:30.096 --> 15:32.723
relax, and let it...

15:35.518 --> 15:38.353
Close your eyes.
Oh, okay.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.230
Okay.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.692
There you go.

15:43.860 --> 15:48.030
That's it.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.866
There you go.

15:51.034 --> 15:58.874
Keep it going.

15:59.042 --> 16:03.795
Keep... Yes! Fifty-six. Oh.

16:53.930 --> 16:57.391
This is so embarrassing.
I am fine, honestly.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.935
It's just some bug going around.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.521
First, my wife had it,
then my son, and now me.

17:02.689 --> 17:06.942
It's just...
It's just like a chest cold.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.568
Could be some low
blood sugar as well.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.821
I didn't have the greatest
breakfast this morning.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.489
Honestly, I didn't.

17:12.657 --> 17:15.617
Hey, listen, can you do me
a favor? Can you just, uh,

17:15.785 --> 17:17.869
drop me off at a corner
somewhere?

17:18.037 --> 17:21.164
Uh, no, sorry.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.292
It's just that I don't have
the greatest insurance.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.336
Take a couple of deep breaths
for me.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.137
Is there anybody
you want us to contact for you?

17:35.304 --> 17:37.556
Ha. No. God, no.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.975
Lean forward for me,
would you?

17:42.687 --> 17:44.604
Mr. White, are you a smoker?

17:44.772 --> 17:47.357
No, never.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.485
Why do you ask?

18:30.151 --> 18:32.694
Mr. White?

18:32.862 --> 18:34.696
Mr. White?

18:35.865 --> 18:37.199
Yes?

18:38.326 --> 18:40.494
You understood
what I've just said to you?

18:40.661 --> 18:42.704
Yes.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.624
Lung cancer. Inoperable.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.920
I'm sorry.
I just need to make sure

18:50.087 --> 18:52.881
you fully understand.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.550
Best-case scenario, with chemo,

18:55.718 --> 18:58.970
I'll live maybe another
couple years.

19:00.515 --> 19:02.432
It's just

19:02.600 --> 19:05.310
you've got mustard on your...

19:06.854 --> 19:09.773
Right there.
You got mustard there.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.483
Right there.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.577
So my records show
that I paid it

19:22.745 --> 19:25.789
and I certainly don't feel
that we owe any late...

19:25.957 --> 19:27.582
Yeah, all right. Um...

19:27.750 --> 19:31.127
Well, I'll check with the bank
and maybe the post office

19:31.295 --> 19:33.588
if they lost it or something.

19:33.756 --> 19:36.800
Yeah, let me look into that.
Okay.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.176
Thank you.

19:41.097 --> 19:44.516
Hey.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.935
Um,

19:47.103 --> 19:49.729
did you use the MasterCard
last month?

19:49.897 --> 19:53.608
Uh,
fifteen eighty-eight at Staples?

19:57.363 --> 20:01.575
Um... Oh, we needed
printer paper.

20:01.742 --> 20:05.745
Walt, the MasterCard's
the one we don't use.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.206
Okay.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.376
So how was your day?

20:12.587 --> 20:14.379
Oh, you know.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.632
I don't know. It was, um,

20:20.136 --> 20:21.636
fine.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.207
Hey, Walter.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.834
Walter.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.086
Walter. Tomorrow night
I'm shorthanded.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.796
I need you outside
to do wipe downs.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.089
Come on.
What?

20:58.257 --> 21:00.258
I said I need you outside
to do some wipe downs.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.719
Are you here to work,
or to be staring at the skies?

21:02.887 --> 21:04.763
Come on. Let's go.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.183
Come on, man.

21:08.351 --> 21:09.851
Fuck you, Bogdan.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.102
What?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.897
I said, "fuck you."
And your eyebrows.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.445
Wipe down this!

22:20.256 --> 22:21.589
Yo.

22:21.757 --> 22:25.051
Uh, Hank?
Hank, it's Walt. Hey.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.762
Oh, listen. I didn't wake you,
did I?

22:27.930 --> 22:30.265
Oh, good, good.

22:30.433 --> 22:34.060
Oh, no, no.
Nothing's wrong. I just...

22:34.228 --> 22:36.896
I've been, uh, thinking about
that offer

22:37.064 --> 22:40.233
of that ride-along.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.902
It's the last house
on the right. See it?

22:43.070 --> 22:44.988
Not the two-story one,
the one next to it.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.657
Kind of, uh, I don't know
what do you call that? Um,

22:47.825 --> 22:48.867
green?

22:49.035 --> 22:51.202
Sage.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.662
"Sage?"

22:52.830 --> 22:55.123
Do you work at the fucking
Pottery Barn? Jesus.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.500
Sage.
That's the word for it.

22:57.668 --> 23:00.628
My fault the only word your
dumb ass knows is "green"?

23:00.796 --> 23:04.340
"Cheese-dick." I know
that one. How about that?

23:04.508 --> 23:06.968
Anyway, it's the, um,
sage one. See it?

23:07.136 --> 23:09.512
So, what tells you
it's a meth lab?

23:09.680 --> 23:10.722
Just our snitch.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.975
Says some dude who
goes by "Cap'n Cook"

23:14.143 --> 23:15.810
lives up to his name in there.

23:15.978 --> 23:20.023
Says he always adds a dash
of chili powder. Heh-heh.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.442
Ah, you exuberant Mexicans.

23:22.610 --> 23:25.528
Uh-uh. "Cap'n Cook?"
That's a white boy's name.

23:25.696 --> 23:26.821
Dopey as hell too.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.990
Yeah? I'll tell you what.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.326
I got you 20 bucks
that says he's a beaner.

23:31.494 --> 23:34.329
All right.
You're on.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.583
All right. Come on,
come on, come on.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.714
All right. School bus is clear.
You got the green light.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.466
Copy that.

23:53.808 --> 23:55.725
Watch this. Makes them shit.

24:00.022 --> 24:01.523
Go, go, go, go!

24:12.201 --> 24:13.910
Meth labs are nasty
on a good day.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.371
You mix that shit wrong
and you got mustard gas.

24:16.539 --> 24:19.207
Phosphine gas.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.584
I think.
Yeah, exactly.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.379
One whiff will kill you.
That's why the respirators.

25:12.595 --> 25:15.013
House is clear.
-One suspect in custody.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.599
Copy that.
The suspect,

25:17.766 --> 25:19.934
might he be of
the Latino persuasion?

25:20.102 --> 25:22.937
Driver's license says
"Emilio Koyama."

25:23.105 --> 25:24.772
Asian. Pay up, sucker.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.609
Hey, hey. First name, Emilio.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.444
That's at least half a beaner.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.571
Tell you what,
I'll let you off for a 10.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.781
Whoa. Heh, heh.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.116
Cheer up, Gomey.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.535
You people still got J. Lo.
Hank.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.622
Do you think I might
get to go inside?

25:40.789 --> 25:42.749
See the actual lab?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.793
Uh,

25:45.961 --> 25:47.128
yeah.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.881
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
we're gonna go peek our heads in

25:50.049 --> 25:52.050
check it out first.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.928
Stay here a minute.
Let's go, Frank.

26:14.865 --> 26:16.324
Oh, God.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.917
Oh, God.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.759
Oh, my God.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.679
Pinkman?

27:34.445 --> 27:38.031
Hey. Uh, it's me.
I'm alone.

27:44.747 --> 27:45.913
How'd you find me?

27:46.081 --> 27:48.916
You're still
in our filing system.

27:52.004 --> 27:55.256
So your... Your aunt
owns this place, right?

27:55.424 --> 27:56.674
I own it.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.804
Look, no one's looking for you.

28:01.972 --> 28:04.098
Why are you here?

28:04.266 --> 28:06.184
I was curious.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.937
Honestly, I never expected
you to amount to much...

28:10.105 --> 28:12.231
but methamphetamine?

28:12.399 --> 28:13.649
I...

28:13.817 --> 28:15.902
I didn't picture that.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.863
There's a lot of money in it,
huh?

28:19.031 --> 28:20.823
I don't know what you're
talking about.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.825
No?
Not a clue.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.954
Cap'n Cook?

28:27.122 --> 28:28.956
That's not you?

28:34.880 --> 28:37.298
Like I said,
no one is looking for you.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.550
Look, I don't know what
you think you're doing here,

28:39.718 --> 28:41.135
Mr. White.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.513
I mean, if you're planning
on giving me some

28:43.680 --> 28:47.141
bull-winder about getting right
with Jesus or turning myself in.

28:47.309 --> 28:50.186
Not really.
High school was a long time ago.

28:50.354 --> 28:54.857
You ain't Welcome Back, Kotter,
so step off. No speeches.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.984
Short speech.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.405
You lost your partner today.
What's-his-name.

29:01.532 --> 29:04.325
Emilio?

29:04.493 --> 29:06.661
Emilio is going to prison.

29:07.955 --> 29:11.791
The DEA took all
your money, your lab.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.669
You've got nothing.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.046
Square one.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.340
But you know the business

29:20.259 --> 29:22.677
and I know the chemistry.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.015
I'm thinking

29:28.183 --> 29:30.393
maybe you and I
could partner up.

29:41.697 --> 29:45.533
You, uh...
You wanna cook crystal meth?

29:46.660 --> 29:48.119
You.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.789
You and, uh...
And me.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.541
That's right.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.085
Wow.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.045
Either that,

29:58.213 --> 30:00.715
or I turn you in.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.351
What the hell is this?

30:12.519 --> 30:13.561
Damned if I know.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.897
I described it
as mosaic folk art.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.273
And somebody bought it?

30:17.441 --> 30:18.733
Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

30:18.901 --> 30:21.319
Fourteen dollars plus shipping.
Yes.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.572
At this rate, in 50 or
60 years you'll be rich.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.116
So how goes the novel?

30:27.284 --> 30:29.744
It's not a novel, actually,
which I...

30:29.912 --> 30:31.454
You're not writing a novel?

30:31.622 --> 30:33.748
You told me you were.
No. Short stories.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.459
I said that if eventually
I have enough good ones,

30:36.627 --> 30:38.377
that maybe I'll try

30:39.421 --> 30:41.130
and publish another collection.

30:41.298 --> 30:43.841
Those really didn't sell.

30:44.009 --> 30:47.929
I just thought a novel
would be easier to sell.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.140
Yeah, well, maybe so.

30:51.308 --> 30:54.101
Ever want me to read anything,
I could critique it for you.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.354
Oh.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.980
No.

30:59.566 --> 31:03.861
I mean, I'm just not
at that stage where I...

31:04.029 --> 31:05.071
No.

31:05.239 --> 31:08.658
Open offer.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.326
So, what's up with Walt lately?

31:10.494 --> 31:12.370
What do you mean?
He's fine.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.455
He just seems,

31:14.623 --> 31:16.541
I don't know.
Quieter than usual.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.293
Well, turning 50 is a big deal.

31:19.461 --> 31:23.172
I mean, I'm sure as hell
not looking forward to 40.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.968
You're gonna be a
complete basket-case.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.473
So it's a mid-life crisis.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.976
No. He's just quiet.

31:35.852 --> 31:36.894
How's the sex?

31:37.062 --> 31:39.105
Marie, Jesus.

31:39.273 --> 31:40.982
I guess that answers that.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.026
You just gonna sit there?

32:33.368 --> 32:35.745
Look at this. Look at this.

32:35.912 --> 32:40.583
Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters. Very rare.

32:40.751 --> 32:43.544
You got your usual
paraphernalia, Griffin beakers,

32:47.841 --> 32:53.054
a round bottom boiling flask,
5000 milliliters. Huh?

32:55.390 --> 32:58.392
I cook in one of those.
A big one.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.854
One of these?

33:02.022 --> 33:03.564
No, this is a
volumetric flask.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.232
You wouldn't cook
in one of these.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.817
Uh, yeah. I do.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.444
Uh, no, you don't.

33:08.612 --> 33:12.490
A volumetric flask is for
general mixing and titration.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.493
You wouldn't apply heat
to a volumetric flask.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.578
That's what a boiling flask
is for.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.081
Did you learn nothing
from my chemistry class?

33:20.248 --> 33:23.334
No. You flunked me, remember?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.795
No wonder.
Prick.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.465
And let me tell you something
else. This ain't chemistry.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.634
Okay, this is art.
Oh, ha.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.427
Cooking is art,

33:33.595 --> 33:36.722
and shit I cook is the bomb,
so don't be telling me.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.350
Shit you cook is shit.
The shit.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.602
I saw your setup. Ridiculous.

33:41.770 --> 33:44.438
You and I will not
make garbage.

33:44.606 --> 33:47.358
We will produce a chemically
pure and stable product

33:47.526 --> 33:49.777
that performs as advertised.
No adulterants.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.487
No baby formula.
No chili powder.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.781
No, no. Chili P's my signature.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.282
Not anymore.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.370
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.621
What the hell is this?

34:00.789 --> 34:02.456
Lab safety equipment.

34:02.624 --> 34:05.751
We're also gonna have
an emergency eye wash station.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.546
These chemicals and
their fumes are toxic.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.381
In case you didn't know that.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.843
Well, you can dress up like
a faggot if you want. Not me.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.642
Listen, this stuff

34:21.810 --> 34:24.061
doesn't stay more than a day.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.938
What? I thought we were gonna cook here.

34:26.106 --> 34:27.481
No, we're not
gonna cook here.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.651
Okay, this is my house.
I don't shit where I eat.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.403
Well, then where
are we gonna work?

34:32.571 --> 34:35.322
You tell me.
This is your deal, man.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.491
You wanna smoke it up,
smoke it up at your house.

34:37.659 --> 34:41.996
No, I didn't think so.
Oh, well.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.499
Well,

34:45.667 --> 34:49.003
what if we rented one of those
self-storage places?

34:49.171 --> 34:52.006
You know, those little orange
garages? Worked out of there?

34:52.174 --> 34:56.093
No, they're onto that. They've
got dogs that sniff around.

34:57.679 --> 35:00.723
RV, that's what you want.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.350
What, like a Winnebago?

35:05.520 --> 35:07.104
Yeah.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.192
I know a dude
who wants to sell his.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.444
He just goes camping with it.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.030
But a mobile meth lab?
That'd be the bomb.

35:16.198 --> 35:20.034
I mean, you can drive
way out in the boonies.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.744
Be all evasive.

35:48.939 --> 35:51.357
Dude, this isn't even
seven grand, all right?

35:51.525 --> 35:52.733
My guy wants 85.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.903
This is all the money
I have in the world.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.489
You're a drug dealer. Negotiate.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.576
You are not how I
remember you from class.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.203
I mean, like, not at all.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.538
Yeah, well, I gotta go.

36:05.705 --> 36:06.747
Wait. Wait. Hold up.

36:08.458 --> 36:11.836
Tell me why you're doing this.
Seriously.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.671
Why do you do it?

36:13.839 --> 36:16.298
Money, mainly.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.551
There you go.

36:18.718 --> 36:21.512
Nah, come on, man.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.056
Some straight like you,
giant stick up his ass

36:24.224 --> 36:27.685
all a sudden at age, what, 60,
he's just gonna break bad?

36:27.853 --> 36:30.271
I'm 50.
It's weird, is all.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.606
Okay, it doesn't compute.
Listen,

36:32.774 --> 36:35.442
if you've gone crazy
or something,

36:35.610 --> 36:39.446
I mean, if y... If you've gone
crazy, or depressed.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.532
I'm... I'm just saying.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.702
T... That's something
I need to know about.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.162
Okay, I mean, that affects me.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.879
I am awake.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.050
What?

37:03.930 --> 37:05.180
Buy the RV.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.101
We start tomorrow.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.817
How's it coming in there?

37:16.985 --> 37:18.986
Fine.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.620
Do you want me or your dad?

37:29.456 --> 37:31.582
Dad.

37:47.349 --> 37:50.225
So how are those feeling in
the waist? Are they too tight?

37:50.393 --> 37:52.686
You don't want to get them
if they're too tight.

37:52.854 --> 37:56.106
They're...
They're pretty shrunk.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.984
Are you sure you don't want to
get the...? Like a different kind?

37:59.152 --> 38:00.903
Like, you know,
the skinny jeans,

38:01.071 --> 38:03.614
because those are in style.
The skaters wear them.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.283
Do I look like a skater?

38:06.451 --> 38:07.493
All right.

38:07.661 --> 38:10.704
Mom, get them, my big boy pants.

38:12.332 --> 38:15.125
Mommy, could you zip up
my big boy pants?

38:21.800 --> 38:24.259
Don't.
-What?

38:24.844 --> 38:26.053
Don't.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.513
Walt.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.101
Where...?
I have no idea.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.729
No, you know what?
Don't even look at them.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.899
They're obviously very stupid.
Yep.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.234
Yeah.

38:42.237 --> 38:45.406
I think that, um... I think those
jeans look really good on you.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.409
I think you should get them
if you like them, okay?

38:48.576 --> 38:51.203
You know what? Why don't you hang out
here for a second. I'll be right back.

38:51.371 --> 38:52.705
Fine.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.957
Hey, Mommy,
I think I pinched a loaf

38:55.125 --> 38:57.710
in my brand new big boy pants.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.176
What are you doing?

39:06.344 --> 39:09.179
What's wrong, chief?
Having a little trouble walking?

39:09.347 --> 39:11.265
Get off me! Get off me!

39:14.519 --> 39:16.103
I'll mess you up, man.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.772
You'll have one shot.
You'd better make it good.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.275
What, are you waiting for
your girlfriends? You better go.

39:21.443 --> 39:24.486
You'd better go. Take it.
Take your shot. Take it!

39:25.572 --> 39:28.198
Come on. Come on.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.909
Come on, let's get
out of here. Let's go.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.038
Psycho.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.201
Yeah, nothing but cows.

40:12.368 --> 40:15.704
Got some big cow house way
out that way, like two miles,

40:15.872 --> 40:18.499
but I don't see nobody.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.167
"Cow house"?

40:20.335 --> 40:23.170
Yeah. Where they live.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.713
The cows.

40:25.757 --> 40:30.177
Whatever, man.
Shit, yeah. Let's cook here.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.181
Cow house.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.724
God help me.

40:45.985 --> 40:49.196
Uh, what are you doing?

40:49.364 --> 40:52.449
These are my good clothes.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.827
You can't go home
smelling like a meth lab.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.871
Uh, yeah, you can. I do.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.748
Those?

40:59.916 --> 41:03.710
Wow. Those, uh... You're
keeping those on, right?

41:11.886 --> 41:14.513
Come on. Daylight's burning.

41:14.681 --> 41:16.640
Oh, my God.

41:24.649 --> 41:27.401
Wow, this is... This is
a good look for you.

41:27.569 --> 41:30.904
I mean, you're maybe only
the world's second-biggest homo.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.740
Would you shut up and help me?

41:33.908 --> 41:36.243
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.996
Work it. Baby, work it.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.998
Turn that off.

42:47.440 --> 42:50.484
This is glass-grade.

42:50.652 --> 42:51.985
You got...

42:52.153 --> 42:56.031
Jesus, you got crystals in here
two inches, three inches long.

42:56.199 --> 42:57.908
This is pure glass.

42:59.494 --> 43:02.162
You're a goddamn artist.

43:02.330 --> 43:05.123
This... This is art, Mr. White.

43:05.291 --> 43:07.668
Well, actually,
it's just basic chemistry,

43:07.835 --> 43:10.671
but thank you, Jesse.
I'm glad it's acceptable.

43:10.838 --> 43:13.674
Acceptable?
You're the goddamn Iron Chef.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.593
Every jibhead from here to
Timbuktu's gonna want a taste.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.888
Man, I... I gotta try this.

43:20.056 --> 43:23.350
No. No.

43:23.518 --> 43:26.019
No. We only sell it.
We don't use it.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.523
Okay, since when?

43:29.691 --> 43:32.192
Listen, you've been watching
way too much Miami Vice.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.694
That ain't happening.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.575
So, what now?

43:42.287 --> 43:43.704
How do we proceed?

43:47.667 --> 43:50.836
We cook more tomorrow.

43:51.004 --> 43:53.088
Meantime,

43:53.256 --> 43:55.674
I know just the guy to talk to.

43:57.844 --> 43:59.845
Get him. Come on.

44:04.851 --> 44:08.145
Hey, yo. Kraze,
how you doing, my man?

44:10.231 --> 44:14.526
Hey, you got a new dog.
Right on, man.

44:14.694 --> 44:16.653
What's his name?

44:17.697 --> 44:19.573
Yeah, I had a dog like that
once,

44:19.741 --> 44:21.742
except maybe like twice as big.

44:21.909 --> 44:23.577
Super-purebred.

44:23.745 --> 44:25.037
Now, me personally,

44:25.204 --> 44:27.372
I would train him to go
straight for the nutsack.

44:27.540 --> 44:29.583
Just shut your mouth
and show me your money.

44:29.751 --> 44:31.251
I ain't buying, ese.

44:31.419 --> 44:34.087
I'm selling.

44:42.930 --> 44:46.600
Tell me that ain't the finest
scante you ever laid eyes on.

44:46.768 --> 44:49.936
Go ahead. Try it.

44:50.104 --> 44:53.273
Hey, poochie. How you doing?

44:53.441 --> 44:55.567
Jesus Christ.

44:55.735 --> 44:59.071
Yeah. Booya! See, what'd I say?

44:59.238 --> 45:01.698
It's all right.
It's all right?

45:01.866 --> 45:03.617
It's all right?
Yeah, it's all right.

45:03.785 --> 45:05.243
So what?
You're back in business?

45:05.411 --> 45:07.079
Hell, yeah, I'm back.

45:07.246 --> 45:10.791
With a vengeance.
Vato loco gotta make a living.

45:10.958 --> 45:13.794
You know, with your cousin
gone away and all...

45:13.961 --> 45:17.297
And listen, homes,
about that...

45:18.716 --> 45:21.802
Really broke me up about Emilio.

45:21.969 --> 45:24.137
That dude is like my brother.

45:24.305 --> 45:25.931
You okay? You talk to him?

45:26.099 --> 45:27.265
Yeah, I talk to him.

45:27.433 --> 45:28.642
Said when the feds came,

45:28.810 --> 45:31.478
you were out sticking it in
some neighbor lady.

45:31.646 --> 45:33.814
Hey, you know,
I got lucky twice.

45:33.981 --> 45:35.857
I don't know, man.

45:36.025 --> 45:37.067
Emilio...

45:39.904 --> 45:42.406
he thinks maybe
you dimed on him.

45:42.573 --> 45:46.660
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
That is bullshit.

45:46.828 --> 45:48.954
That is bullshit, Krazy-8.

45:49.122 --> 45:51.748
I should kick his punk ass
for even thinking that.

45:51.916 --> 45:54.000
You know what?
Next time you talk to Emilio,

45:54.168 --> 45:56.753
you tell him for me, all right?

46:00.508 --> 46:03.885
Why don't you tell him yourself?
Made bail this morning.

46:04.053 --> 46:05.846
Go ahead, pendejo.

46:06.013 --> 46:08.014
Kick my ass.
Hey, listen...

46:11.853 --> 46:13.979
Where did you get this?

46:14.147 --> 46:15.522
Hm?

46:15.690 --> 46:19.025
Because I know your little
punk ass didn't cook it.

46:47.597 --> 46:51.892
Damn, man. What are
you, some kind of nudist?

46:53.478 --> 46:57.147
Yeah, that's some stone-fine
tick-tick you been cooking there, ese.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.982
How about you come
work for me?

47:00.651 --> 47:03.737
I'd be willing to sell it to you

47:03.905 --> 47:05.280
if... If the price is right.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.418
Out here all by yourself, huh?

47:25.927 --> 47:30.055
Hey, I know you. He was
there when I got busted.

47:30.223 --> 47:32.265
He's with the DEA.
No.

47:32.433 --> 47:35.602
You rata snitch motherfucker.

47:35.770 --> 47:37.312
Run, Mr. White! Run!

47:39.315 --> 47:40.524
Ah.

47:47.573 --> 47:49.199
I say we cap them both.

47:56.541 --> 47:58.667
You really cook up that batch?

48:00.378 --> 48:01.419
Yeah.

48:01.587 --> 48:03.463
You an artist.

48:05.049 --> 48:06.633
It's a damn shame.
Wait.

48:06.801 --> 48:09.970
Wait a minute.

48:10.137 --> 48:14.808
Listen to me.
I'll teach you my recipe, huh?

48:14.976 --> 48:17.143
What do you say?
You wanna cook like me?

48:20.439 --> 48:22.440
You let us both live,

48:23.651 --> 48:27.404
and I will teach you, huh?

48:56.767 --> 48:59.019
Put the cigarette out.

49:01.522 --> 49:03.064
Please...

49:46.400 --> 49:50.111
Move it, homes. You got all day?

49:52.573 --> 49:53.990
Okay.

52:13.506 --> 52:14.631
Shit.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.470
Shit!

54:05.409 --> 54:06.951
What happened?

54:09.622 --> 54:12.332
Hey, what'd you do to them?

54:14.126 --> 54:15.877
Red phosphorus in the
presence of moisture

54:16.045 --> 54:17.962
and accelerated by heat

54:18.130 --> 54:20.423
yields phosphorus hydride.

54:21.467 --> 54:23.718
Phosphine gas.

54:23.886 --> 54:27.764
One good whiff and poof.

54:50.621 --> 54:52.288
We gotta...

54:54.291 --> 54:57.710
We gotta clean this up.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.634
Where were you?

55:54.935 --> 55:56.602
Walt...

55:59.189 --> 56:01.774
I don't know what's
been going on with you lately

56:01.942 --> 56:04.694
but...
Nothing, honey. I'm fine.

56:04.862 --> 56:09.490
Whatever it is,
I'll tell you this.

56:09.658 --> 56:12.869
I do not like it
when you don't talk to me.

56:14.246 --> 56:17.248
The worst thing you can do
is shut me out.

57:03.504 --> 57:05.004
Walt...

57:07.466 --> 57:10.885
Oh, Walt, is that you?
