00:05.064 --> 00:08.567
Here's my resumÃ©.

00:08.776 --> 00:12.071
I mean, technically it says
"curriculum vitae"...

00:12.279 --> 00:16.241
...which I think is more professional,
but, you know...

00:16.450 --> 00:17.951
...same thing, pretty much.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.953
That's... Wow, great.

00:20.162 --> 00:23.123
This position truly is a
no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

00:23.332 --> 00:26.543
And it doesn't really say it here...

00:26.752 --> 00:30.631
...but I have a solid background
in sales.

00:30.839 --> 00:32.758
I'm pretty much a self-starter, so...

00:32.966 --> 00:35.135
- That's excellent, but...
- Excellent.

00:35.344 --> 00:36.470
I just...

00:36.678 --> 00:39.431
...I really feel I could be a major...

00:39.640 --> 00:42.726
...major asset to your sales force.

00:45.437 --> 00:47.648
I'm thinking there's
a little misunderstanding.

00:47.856 --> 00:49.525
This isn't actually a sales job.

00:49.733 --> 00:53.445
I mean, I'd be happy to consider you
for a sales position...

00:53.654 --> 00:55.698
...but all our agents
need to be licensed...

00:55.906 --> 00:58.325
...have at least two years
on-the-job experience...

00:58.534 --> 01:00.077
...and usually a college degree.

01:04.707 --> 01:06.917
What you'll be doing is more like...

01:07.126 --> 01:08.961
...advertising.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.475
Hey, Jesse.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.811
Hey, man.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.146
Yo, man.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.231
- What up?
- Badger?

01:29.440 --> 01:31.900
Where you been keeping yourself?

01:32.651 --> 01:34.570
Nice duds.

01:34.778 --> 01:36.488
Yeah, you too.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.365
Thanks.

01:38.574 --> 01:41.410
Yo, why would you wanna do
this lame-ass job, anyway?

01:41.618 --> 01:43.412
I mean, no offense.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.080
Because I'm on probation, yo.

01:45.289 --> 01:48.625
I gotta prove to the man
I'm rehabilitated.

01:48.834 --> 01:51.879
Upstanding citizen, all that shit.

01:52.087 --> 01:54.840
It's really good exercise too.

01:55.049 --> 01:57.676
You can't just stand there,
you have to spin the arrow.

01:57.885 --> 02:01.138
There's all these moves
you have to learn, like "the helicopter."

02:05.351 --> 02:07.561
Yeah. See, yeah?

02:07.770 --> 02:09.104
That one's a bitch.

02:09.313 --> 02:10.939
I'm not very good at it yet.

02:11.148 --> 02:13.359
You really opened my eyes
to the possibilities.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.819
- Yeah.
- Hey, anyways...

02:17.029 --> 02:19.239
- ...thanks for the toke.
- Any time.

02:19.448 --> 02:20.574
Speaking of which...

02:21.784 --> 02:25.120
...you think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

02:25.913 --> 02:28.665
No, I've been out of the business
for a while.

02:28.874 --> 02:31.126
Actually, now thinking about retiring.

02:31.335 --> 02:33.337
- What? No.
- Yeah.

02:33.545 --> 02:35.923
That stuff you made is unbelievable.

02:36.131 --> 02:37.508
It was pretty awesome.

02:37.716 --> 02:38.884
Retirement?

02:40.010 --> 02:41.387
I can't be hearing this.

02:41.595 --> 02:45.641
No, man, I had this partner
who was helping me cook.

02:45.849 --> 02:48.227
I mean, I was doing
most of the work...

02:50.437 --> 02:52.481
...but he was an asshole, so.

02:52.690 --> 02:55.943
Anyway, I mean, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by and...

02:56.151 --> 02:58.862
Yo, I can hook you up
with some pseudo.

02:59.071 --> 03:00.781
Major pseudo.

03:00.989 --> 03:03.367
I got channels, bro.

03:03.575 --> 03:04.993
We could partner up.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.372
No pressure.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.958
No pressure.
Just think about it, all right?

03:11.166 --> 03:13.711
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

03:23.345 --> 03:25.723
Yo, this way to savings.

03:25.931 --> 03:28.017
Save your dollar bills, y'all.

03:33.897 --> 03:36.358
<i>Big savings This way and save</i>

03:38.152 --> 03:41.822
Come on! Save some money.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.666
It's a stupid gift.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.418
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

04:10.626 --> 04:12.294
I don't know what I was thinking.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.423
Didn't the invitation
even say "no gifts"?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.341
- Walt.
- What?

04:17.550 --> 04:19.135
We have to go.

04:19.844 --> 04:21.220
I know, I'm not complaining.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.638
Yes, you are.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.268
Look, we need this.

04:27.476 --> 04:30.688
We've been through a lot
lately. Okay?

04:32.857 --> 04:36.986
Jesus, guess we didn't get
the "beige" memo.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.238
We're okay.

04:39.447 --> 04:42.742
Yes, I look like I'm wearing
a prom dress from 1985.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.577
Honey, you look fine.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.205
Walt, this is the only thing
I could find that fit me.

04:49.415 --> 04:53.169
God, would you look at that.
The invitation said "no gifts."

04:54.503 --> 04:55.713
So? Come on.

04:55.921 --> 04:59.216
Sir, I'll take that for you.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.596
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.308
Oh, look, there's Elliott.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.102
Oh, come on, let's go say hello.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.022
Elliott.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.107
Walt.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.485
You made it.

05:17.693 --> 05:18.694
Happy birthday.

05:18.903 --> 05:21.113
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Skyler.

05:21.322 --> 05:24.241
Hi. Oh, that's right.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.786
Great to see you.
You look beautiful, as always.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.206
Well, these days a little more big
than beautiful, but...

05:30.414 --> 05:33.834
Of course, congratulations.
That was such great news.

05:34.043 --> 05:37.672
- Thank you.
- Gretchen, look who's here.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.802
It's been ages.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.805
Oh, it's so good to see you.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.641
It's really good.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.434
Skyler, welcome. Congratulations.

05:50.643 --> 05:52.937
Thank you.
It's really nice to be here.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.690
- When are you due?
- In about 10 more weeks.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.944
And actually, we recently found out
that it's a girl.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.822
- Oh, that's so wonderful.
- Yeah.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.491
Yeah, we've been thinking about it
for ourselves.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.951
Yeah, thinking about it.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.123
Oh, hey, by the way...

06:12.331 --> 06:15.209
...securing that patent
was just amazing.

06:15.418 --> 06:19.296
I mean, the work
that your company is doing...

06:19.505 --> 06:21.215
Congratulations to both of you.

06:21.424 --> 06:25.261
- Hard work and a lot of luck. A lot.
- Yeah. Oh, well, now.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.762
Elliott.

06:26.971 --> 06:28.431
Excuse us, we gotta say hi.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.474
Make yourselves at home,
we'll catch up.

06:30.683 --> 06:31.976
Sure, sure. Okay.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.561
- Okay.
- So glad you're here.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.271
- Thank you.
- Bye.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.148
John, Missy. How are you?

06:37.356 --> 06:38.899
Shall we?

06:40.443 --> 06:42.653
Congratulations. Happy birthday.

07:57.228 --> 07:58.437
Walt?

07:58.646 --> 08:00.189
I thought that was you.

08:00.398 --> 08:01.565
Farley.

08:01.774 --> 08:03.442
Long time no see.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.653
- This is Walter White.
- Hello.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.530
Back at Caltech, he was...

08:07.738 --> 08:10.366
You were just a master
of crystallography.

08:10.574 --> 08:14.662
I remember this one time we were
stuck on this protein problem...

08:14.870 --> 08:16.580
...for weeks.

08:16.789 --> 08:19.083
You just breezed right in...

08:19.291 --> 08:21.043
...and you had one word for us...

08:21.252 --> 08:24.088
Synchrotrons.
It was synchrotrons, yeah.

08:24.296 --> 08:27.883
They generate pure and more complete
patterns than x-ray beams.

08:28.092 --> 08:31.137
Data collection
takes a fraction of the time.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.723
This is the White in Gray Matter.

08:35.141 --> 08:38.102
- Tell them, Walt.
- Okay.

08:38.310 --> 08:41.480
Well, back when Elliott and I
were in grad school...

08:41.689 --> 08:43.274
...we came up with the name.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.485
Schwartz, black. Walter White.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.613
So together they became
Gray Matter Technologies.

08:49.822 --> 08:52.366
- Cute, huh?
- So you run the company with Elliott?

08:52.575 --> 08:55.327
No. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.706
Yeah, yeah. You know,
I gravitated toward education.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.083
What university?

09:03.544 --> 09:07.381
Oh, wow, it's a Stratocaster.

09:07.590 --> 09:11.344
Not just any Strat.
That's one of Clapton's.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.429
No way.

09:13.637 --> 09:18.059
"To Elliott, sorry about the buckle rash,
Eric Clapton."

09:18.267 --> 09:21.020
Thank you. This is beautiful.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.064
- Why is he doing this?
- Beautiful.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.066
What is he, like, 8 years old?

09:25.274 --> 09:27.026
Here, honey.

09:30.363 --> 09:31.572
Thanks.

09:31.781 --> 09:32.948
Oh, this is from Walt.

09:33.157 --> 09:34.784
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.037
Hey.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.831
Let's see what we got.

09:46.796 --> 09:48.422
Yum Good Ramen.

09:59.975 --> 10:04.689
This is what Walt and I lived on...

10:04.897 --> 10:07.274
...for 10 months straight...

10:07.483 --> 10:10.277
...while we were working
on our thesis.

10:10.486 --> 10:13.406
Sold them down at Ralstow's
in the hardware isle.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.408
Right next to the... What was it?

10:15.616 --> 10:17.743
- Sterno. Yeah.
- The Sterno.

10:17.952 --> 10:19.995
Yeah, ten for a dollar ninety-nine.

10:20.204 --> 10:23.165
To this day,
I am convinced these noodles...

10:23.374 --> 10:25.501
...were responsible for our success.

10:25.710 --> 10:27.837
This was our lifeblood.

10:28.045 --> 10:31.549
Man, where'd you find these? I thought
they'd been outlawed years ago.

10:33.718 --> 10:35.302
I love it.

10:37.513 --> 10:38.931
Thank you, Walt.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.267
Well.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.394
For the man who has everything.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.688
- No, no, no.
- It was.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.732
- No, you remember the fat guy.
- Yes.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.608
We used to call him Snot Trough.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.402
He had that thing under his nose.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.113
- What do you call that thing?
- That was Dobkins.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.241
That was the same guy
who always smelled like chocolate milk.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.160
- It was.
- No, no, no.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.704
It wasn't Dobkins, it was...

11:01.912 --> 11:05.333
Anyway, I swear to Christ,
he used to iron those patches...

11:05.541 --> 11:08.836
...onto the elbows
of his members-only jacket...

11:09.045 --> 11:11.505
...because he thought it made him
look more distinguished.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.799
- Didn't it? I thought it...
- No.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.345
Oh, God.
Well, here's to Snot Trough.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.305
- To Snot Trough.
- Wherever you may be.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.140
God bless him.

11:22.683 --> 11:27.813
Do you remember the professor who
used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

11:28.022 --> 11:31.067
Yes. All you had to do
was mention the Bunsen burner...

11:31.275 --> 11:33.277
...and he was off on a rant.

11:33.486 --> 11:36.530
"Oh, he didn't invent it."
Do you remember the waving?

11:36.739 --> 11:39.492
"He just improved it," you know.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.327
It was easy to kill 15 minutes.

11:41.535 --> 11:42.995
Yeah.

11:44.288 --> 11:45.623
Oh, God.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.792
I miss this, Walt.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.586
Yeah. Me too.

11:50.795 --> 11:52.880
Listen, we ought to get together
more often.

11:53.089 --> 11:55.508
Skyler and I would love
to have you and Gretchen...

11:55.716 --> 11:57.343
...over for dinner sometime.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.387
Oh, sure, yeah, absolutely.

12:00.638 --> 12:05.393
But, you know, what I mean is that
you and I should work together again.

12:07.687 --> 12:10.439
- Are you gonna teach high school?
- No, no, no, seriously.

12:10.648 --> 12:12.900
What's stopping us?

12:15.736 --> 12:18.155
Wait a minute, Elliott,
what are you...?

12:18.364 --> 12:21.075
Are you asking me to come work
for you at Gray Matter?

12:21.283 --> 12:23.285
Yeah, why not? You'd fit right in.

12:23.494 --> 12:26.747
You're brilliant,
you got a ton of experience.

12:26.956 --> 12:28.541
Well...

12:28.749 --> 12:30.710
...I wouldn't really know
where to begin.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.169
I mean...

12:32.378 --> 12:34.463
God, you have no idea.

12:34.672 --> 12:38.634
I spend my days just drawing out
atoms on the chalkboard...

12:38.843 --> 12:41.679
...and trying to get these kids to learn
the periodic table.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.723
Look, I understand.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.435
You're a little rusty,
but you're not seeing the upside here.

12:47.643 --> 12:51.355
We could really benefit
from a new set of eyes.

12:51.564 --> 12:54.275
You know when you've
been trying to crack some problem...

12:54.483 --> 12:56.527
...for months on end,
you get tunnel vision.

12:56.736 --> 13:01.574
One guy thinking outside of the box,
you may be exactly what we need.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.259
Well, listen, Elliott, it...

13:20.468 --> 13:23.763
The offer is very appealing,
it really is, I thank you.

13:25.181 --> 13:27.350
But there's...

13:27.558 --> 13:29.810
There's something you should know.

13:32.104 --> 13:36.817
I have some personal issues.

13:37.026 --> 13:39.320
Look, there's nothing
we can't work out.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.781
Well, yeah, but...

13:41.989 --> 13:44.575
...it's complicated.

13:45.326 --> 13:46.952
We can help you.

13:47.161 --> 13:49.872
We have excellent health insurance.

13:52.375 --> 13:54.168
The best.

14:15.106 --> 14:17.608
Hey, did you try those
prosciutto-wrapped figs?

14:17.817 --> 14:19.735
They were, like, wow.
They were just...

14:19.944 --> 14:22.363
I must have had about 30
of those suckers.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.615
Oh, and the seafood table,
did you see that?

14:24.824 --> 14:28.202
They had lobster tail,
they had crab legs, like, shrimp.

14:28.411 --> 14:29.954
They had...

14:32.748 --> 14:36.085
- Walt.
- What the hell did you say to Elliott?

14:36.293 --> 14:38.129
- What?
- You told him about the cancer...

14:38.337 --> 14:41.173
...didn't you? Didn't you?

14:41.382 --> 14:43.551
I can't believe it.

14:43.759 --> 14:47.346
Okay, we were talking,
he asked how you were doing...

14:47.555 --> 14:50.891
...and I am sorry, but I don't have
the best poker face these days...

14:51.100 --> 14:52.476
...where that's concerned.

14:52.685 --> 14:56.313
He knew something was wrong
with you, and he pressed me.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.024
He pressed you? Come on.

14:58.232 --> 15:00.860
Walt, when it came right down to it...

15:01.068 --> 15:03.446
...I didn't know what to do
but tell him the truth.

15:03.654 --> 15:07.408
The truth? Well, how about
you just said, "He's fine," huh?

15:09.702 --> 15:12.663
You could have said that. "He's fine."
It would have been done.

15:12.872 --> 15:14.582
I don't like the way you're talking.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.418
I don't like the way you talk
about private affairs...

15:17.626 --> 15:21.630
...to people who are not
even in our lives anymore.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.258
Well, what exactly did he say to you?

15:24.467 --> 15:25.801
- He offered me a job.
- What?

15:26.010 --> 15:29.513
Yes. Kind of like some fig leaf,
you know.

15:29.722 --> 15:32.141
Some face-saving bullshit...

15:32.350 --> 15:35.519
...that allowed me
to generously accept his charity.

15:35.728 --> 15:38.189
And then when I turned that down,
he flat out...

15:38.397 --> 15:40.441
...offered to pay for my treatment.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.736
Which is exactly what
you expected him to do, didn't you?

15:44.278 --> 15:45.279
- Walt.
- Didn't you?

15:45.488 --> 15:49.200
- No. I did not put him up...
- Please. Come on. Come on.

15:51.452 --> 15:53.871
Okay, what did you say?

15:55.998 --> 15:57.708
Walt?

15:58.334 --> 16:00.127
What do you think I said?

16:01.045 --> 16:03.422
Why? Walt.

16:53.514 --> 16:56.809
- Ready to go?
- I'm taking the bus.

16:58.328 --> 17:00.413
Okay.

17:02.082 --> 17:04.376
Bye, honey.

17:42.247 --> 17:45.000
Hey, dude. Are these bullet holes?

17:47.002 --> 17:49.963
No, man. Those are for,
like, you know...

17:50.172 --> 17:52.215
...ventilation.

17:53.008 --> 17:54.301
Cool.

17:55.761 --> 17:58.930
Nice setup, huh?

17:59.139 --> 18:01.224
- Man.
- This is nothing, man.

18:01.433 --> 18:04.311
I used to have, like,
twice as much glassware...

18:04.519 --> 18:10.692
...until my dumb-ass ex-partner drove
us into a ditch and wrecked most of it.

18:10.901 --> 18:13.445
Big-ass beaker, huh?

18:13.653 --> 18:17.073
Hey, wait, wait, no, that's...
Yeah, that's a boiling flask.

18:17.282 --> 18:19.326
This is a beaker.

18:19.534 --> 18:24.206
Here's a Griffin beaker.
Here's a volumetric beaker.

18:24.414 --> 18:27.209
Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.

18:27.417 --> 18:29.711
You got...

18:29.920 --> 18:32.255
You really know your shit.

18:32.464 --> 18:33.965
It's just basic chemistry, yo.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.469
So...

18:37.677 --> 18:39.638
...you got something for me?

18:39.846 --> 18:41.515
Hells, yeah.

18:52.567 --> 18:53.735
Okay.

18:53.944 --> 18:56.071
We're in business.

18:56.279 --> 18:57.322
Right on, Badger.

18:57.531 --> 18:59.825
Dude, check this out.

19:00.492 --> 19:01.701
Jesus.

19:01.910 --> 19:05.372
- What are you bringing that for?
- Hunting.

19:05.580 --> 19:07.874
We might see javelinas.

19:37.779 --> 19:39.531
Are you gonna help me or what?

19:45.036 --> 19:46.872
Hey.

19:51.418 --> 19:52.669
Badger!

20:03.513 --> 20:05.724
Yeah, buddy. Yeah.

20:50.977 --> 20:52.771
Let's see the money.

20:53.230 --> 20:54.523
Here.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.817
I need five each.
Come on, two more.

20:57.025 --> 20:58.819
Here.

20:59.486 --> 21:00.946
What about him?

21:01.905 --> 21:04.074
Are you kidding?
He looks younger than us.

21:04.282 --> 21:05.534
Whatever.

21:06.535 --> 21:08.078
What about that guy?

21:08.286 --> 21:10.080
No, he looks like a businessman.

21:10.288 --> 21:11.289
So what?

21:11.498 --> 21:14.126
So, businessmen
are always in a hurry.

21:14.334 --> 21:17.587
They're always, like, going
to some meeting or something.

21:17.796 --> 21:19.756
Seriously, he's just gonna say no.

21:21.758 --> 21:23.635
Hey, hey, this guy.

21:23.844 --> 21:24.845
This is our guy.

21:25.053 --> 21:26.096
You're up.

21:26.304 --> 21:28.098
Why do I have to do it?

21:28.306 --> 21:30.225
Give me the crutches
and I'll go do it.

21:32.185 --> 21:33.854
Shit.

21:36.231 --> 21:38.400
Excuse me, hey...

21:38.608 --> 21:40.777
...we forgot our IDs,
and we were wondering...

21:40.986 --> 21:44.614
...if you could do us a favour
and buy us a six-pack?

21:44.823 --> 21:47.367
You know,
what you're asking is illegal.

21:48.827 --> 21:50.078
No, it's not.

21:50.287 --> 21:52.289
Yeah, it is.

21:52.497 --> 21:54.833
Oh, shit.

21:57.169 --> 21:59.421
Guess you win the jackpot.

22:00.881 --> 22:03.091
This is not how I wanted to spend
my night off.

22:03.842 --> 22:06.428
Consider this your first
and last warning.

22:06.636 --> 22:09.639
- Yes, sir.
- You're lucky you got a good dad, here.

22:17.731 --> 22:19.775
The other guys had to run.

22:19.983 --> 22:22.778
I couldn't talk my way out of it.

22:22.986 --> 22:25.113
Not cool, man. Not cool.

22:25.322 --> 22:28.825
What, you never tried to buy beer
when you were my age?

22:29.034 --> 22:31.912
I'm talking about you calling me
and not your father.

22:32.329 --> 22:34.331
How do you think
that'd make him feel?

22:44.591 --> 22:47.135
I don't even know what to say to you.

22:49.638 --> 22:51.640
Just go.

22:51.848 --> 22:54.017
I'll deal with you later.

23:00.649 --> 23:01.983
Where's Walt?

23:03.610 --> 23:07.114
I haven't seen him since this morning.
Your guess is as good as mine.

23:07.572 --> 23:09.699
Listen, do me a favour, all right?

23:09.908 --> 23:11.785
Don't tell him about the kid.

23:11.993 --> 23:14.913
He's just a teenager
trying to score some beer.

23:15.831 --> 23:17.374
You know...

23:18.041 --> 23:19.376
...growing pains.

23:20.293 --> 23:23.880
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick,
he starts acting out, you know?

23:24.089 --> 23:26.758
First the pot, then this.

23:26.967 --> 23:28.385
The pot?

23:31.555 --> 23:34.724
- You told me the kid was smoking.
- That's what Skyler told me.

23:34.933 --> 23:39.187
- I mean, you may as well have.
- I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr.

23:39.396 --> 23:42.190
I was talking about Walt.

23:43.942 --> 23:46.403
Excuse me?

23:46.611 --> 23:48.947
He admitted it.

23:49.990 --> 23:52.367
He said he liked it.

23:52.951 --> 23:54.661
Walt?

23:58.665 --> 24:00.542
Shit.

24:04.045 --> 24:06.506
I didn't think he had it in him.

24:06.715 --> 24:08.800
- It's like he's not himself lately.
- Yeah.

24:09.009 --> 24:10.093
I mean...

24:10.302 --> 24:13.680
...why would anyone in their right mind
choose not to do treatment?

24:13.889 --> 24:16.516
Especially when
it's completely paid for.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.602
Why is he doing this?

24:19.936 --> 24:21.772
You know what we need to do?

24:21.980 --> 24:24.941
What we really need to do
is sit him down, all of us...

24:25.150 --> 24:27.360
...and get everything out
on the table.

24:27.569 --> 24:29.905
Talk it all through.

24:30.113 --> 24:33.116
- You mean an intervention?
- No, no.

24:33.325 --> 24:36.703
Just a family meeting.

24:36.912 --> 24:40.040
Where everyone
can voice their concerns...

24:40.248 --> 24:42.584
...and be heard.

24:50.592 --> 24:52.677
You are a genius, bro.

24:52.886 --> 24:54.846
This cankenstein is unreal.

24:55.055 --> 24:57.182
When we get back,
I'm gonna burn that suit...

24:57.390 --> 25:00.602
...because we're gonna
make some mad dough.

25:01.561 --> 25:03.522
It's not right.

25:03.730 --> 25:05.232
What do you mean, it's not right?

25:06.983 --> 25:10.570
It's cloudy.
It's not supposed to be cloudy.

25:10.779 --> 25:13.490
Okay, that last time, it was glass.

25:13.698 --> 25:18.620
So what? Cloudy, not cloudy?
It looks good enough to me.

25:20.539 --> 25:22.457
Good enough.

25:24.459 --> 25:27.671
Wait, wait.
Yo, what are you doing?

25:33.093 --> 25:35.762
Are you out of your mind?
I totally would've smoked that.

25:35.971 --> 25:38.098
It's not for you,
it's for our customers.

25:38.306 --> 25:40.225
They're gonna demand
a certain standard.

25:40.434 --> 25:43.353
What? What...? What are you...?

25:43.728 --> 25:46.022
- What?
- We'll just do it again.

25:46.815 --> 25:48.150
Until we get it right.

26:14.092 --> 26:15.927
Walt.

26:17.763 --> 26:20.307
Please have a seat and join us.

27:11.399 --> 27:14.402
- We can do better.
- Don't you fucking think about it.

27:14.611 --> 27:17.447
- Hey.
- Come on.

27:19.074 --> 27:20.784
Three entire pounds
of pseudo wasted.

27:20.992 --> 27:23.120
Do you know how long
I had to spin that sign?

27:23.328 --> 27:27.207
- Get off me, psycho.
- Helicopter, bitch!

27:36.174 --> 27:38.051
God!

27:42.264 --> 27:43.265
Asshole.

27:46.143 --> 27:47.185
Open the door.

28:08.999 --> 28:11.918
Come back here, you bitch!

28:12.127 --> 28:13.628
I'm gonna mess you up!

28:15.422 --> 28:17.257
This isn't funny!

28:26.349 --> 28:29.853
I really need to understand
your thought process...

28:30.061 --> 28:31.938
...because clearly I don't.

28:32.147 --> 28:36.943
I feel that this decision
you've made...

28:37.152 --> 28:39.488
...is not only
not in your best interest...

28:39.696 --> 28:43.116
...it's not in the best interest
of our entire family.

28:43.533 --> 28:46.620
- Look, Skyler...
- Not yet, please. I...

28:47.579 --> 28:48.830
I have the talking pillow.

28:51.917 --> 28:54.044
Everybody gets to speak their minds,
remember?

28:54.252 --> 28:56.880
And then you'll get your chance.

28:57.422 --> 29:01.051
Money has always been
an issue for us, I'll give you that.

29:01.259 --> 29:04.387
But now that Elliott is more than willing
to pitch in...

29:04.596 --> 29:07.849
Walt, I know, I understand
that it's hard for you to accept help.

29:08.058 --> 29:10.102
Maybe it's the way you were raised.

29:10.310 --> 29:12.187
But, honey...

29:12.395 --> 29:16.316
...it's okay to lean on people
now and again.

29:16.525 --> 29:18.777
You need this treatment.

29:18.985 --> 29:21.863
And nothing can stop you
from getting it...

29:22.072 --> 29:23.740
...except you.

29:31.414 --> 29:34.793
- Am I allowed to respond?
- In a minute.

29:35.001 --> 29:38.922
I think we need
to go around the circle first.

29:40.841 --> 29:43.009
Hank, would you like to start?

29:46.847 --> 29:50.225
Yeah. Okay, well...

29:50.434 --> 29:52.727
- What I would say is...
- Take the talking pillow.

29:59.693 --> 30:01.778
All right, look, buddy...

30:02.529 --> 30:06.825
...I know I don't get to
tell you this enough...

30:08.368 --> 30:10.620
...but I care about you.

30:11.288 --> 30:13.373
A hell of a lot.

30:14.082 --> 30:15.876
And this cancer thing...

30:16.585 --> 30:20.547
Let's just... Let's face it, you know,
you were dealt a shit hand.

30:20.756 --> 30:22.632
But...

30:22.841 --> 30:24.718
...sometimes your luck can change.

30:24.926 --> 30:26.011
I mean...

30:26.219 --> 30:29.890
I mean, I can't tell you how many times
I was... I started with a shit hand...

30:30.098 --> 30:33.769
...and I ended up with a, you know,
a full house. Okay?

30:34.186 --> 30:36.313
I mean, the key is,
you gotta hang in there.

30:36.521 --> 30:40.567
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets,
keep placing your bets.

30:42.235 --> 30:43.820
Hank...

30:44.029 --> 30:46.990
- ...what the hell are you saying?
- Please, Marie, let him talk.

30:47.199 --> 30:50.327
That's what we're here to do. Please.

30:51.244 --> 30:53.079
Go on, Hank.

30:53.997 --> 30:58.168
All right, look at it this way, okay?

30:58.376 --> 31:01.338
It's the bottom of the ninth,
bases are loaded...

31:01.546 --> 31:03.090
...you're up.

31:03.715 --> 31:06.009
But you got a bum arm, right?

31:06.218 --> 31:09.429
There's no fricking way
you're gonna hit a homer, okay?

31:09.638 --> 31:13.308
So you can either let the pinch hitter
take the bat...

31:13.517 --> 31:17.479
...or you can hold on to your pride
and lose the game.

31:17.854 --> 31:19.815
You get what I'm saying?

31:21.024 --> 31:22.901
No.

31:25.153 --> 31:27.864
You got your pride, man.
I get it, okay? I get it.

31:28.615 --> 31:30.826
But this Daddy Warbucks
wants to chip in, man.

31:31.034 --> 31:35.247
I'm with your old lady on this one.
I say take the money and run, man.

31:38.583 --> 31:40.669
Somebody wanna take this thing?
Here.

31:40.877 --> 31:42.212
Yes, Walter...

31:42.421 --> 31:48.176
Walter, Jr., I'm sure that you have
about a million things to say, probably.

31:48.385 --> 31:50.846
And now is your chance.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.308
Go ahead. Just let it all out.

31:57.853 --> 31:59.020
This is bullshit.

31:59.229 --> 32:01.064
- All right, come on.
- It's all right.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.150
It...

32:06.027 --> 32:07.821
Talk.

32:08.029 --> 32:10.532
Tell your dad how you feel.

32:13.452 --> 32:16.246
- I'm pissed off.
- Tell him.

32:16.997 --> 32:19.624
I'm pissed off.

32:19.833 --> 32:22.419
Because you're being...

32:23.086 --> 32:24.379
You're...

32:26.590 --> 32:28.091
You're a pussy.

32:30.093 --> 32:33.430
You're, like, ready to give up.

32:35.682 --> 32:39.186
You're... God.

32:39.394 --> 32:41.855
What if you gave up on me, huh?

32:47.903 --> 32:49.654
This here...

32:49.863 --> 32:51.865
...all the stuff I've been through...

32:52.073 --> 32:56.369
...and you're scared
of a little chemotherapy?

33:10.926 --> 33:13.512
Me, personally...

33:15.555 --> 33:18.058
...I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

33:20.018 --> 33:21.520
What?

33:22.354 --> 33:24.731
You told us to be honest
about our feelings.

33:24.940 --> 33:27.067
Walt's the one with cancer,
it's his decision.

33:27.275 --> 33:29.236
It's not up to any of us.

33:29.444 --> 33:33.907
- Why in hell would you do this?
- Hey, hey.

33:34.116 --> 33:37.244
I wasn't planning
on agreeing with Walt.

33:37.452 --> 33:40.497
After sitting and listening
to you all talk about his future...

33:40.705 --> 33:44.084
- ...like he has no say in it...
- He's not gonna have a future...

33:44.292 --> 33:45.961
...if he doesn't get treatment.

33:46.169 --> 33:49.172
I am a medical professional.

33:49.381 --> 33:53.301
I x-ray people in treatment
every day.

33:53.510 --> 33:56.012
I see them every day.
And you know what?

33:56.221 --> 33:59.975
Some of them
are absolutely miserable.

34:00.183 --> 34:02.811
- Marie...
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

34:03.019 --> 34:07.649
And some of them don't wanna spend
their last weeks or months...

34:07.858 --> 34:10.318
...being picked at by doctors.

34:10.527 --> 34:12.946
But they got talked into it
by their families.

34:13.155 --> 34:15.282
Can I get the pillow back?
I agree with Marie.

34:15.490 --> 34:16.491
- Thank you.
- Hank...

34:16.700 --> 34:18.869
What? Maybe Walt wants to die
like a man.

34:19.077 --> 34:21.496
I don't want him to die at all.

34:21.705 --> 34:24.958
That's the whole point of this.
So either help or leave.

34:25.417 --> 34:28.253
Skyler, I just wanted
to do you the courtesy...

34:28.462 --> 34:30.714
...of giving you my honest opinion.

34:30.922 --> 34:34.551
You know, Marie,
this is not debate club.

34:34.760 --> 34:40.098
- This is my husband's life...
- I made one simple observation...

34:40.307 --> 34:43.852
- And it's like you... How dare you...
- Okay, so we disagree...

34:44.060 --> 34:46.062
Ladies! Marie!

34:48.356 --> 34:50.776
This is so stupid.

34:55.322 --> 34:57.365
All right,
I've got the talking pillow now.

34:58.825 --> 35:00.035
Okay?

35:10.754 --> 35:13.757
We all, in this room...

35:14.174 --> 35:16.218
...we love each other.

35:16.551 --> 35:20.138
We want what's best for each other,
and I know that.

35:20.555 --> 35:23.058
I am very thankful for that.

35:24.434 --> 35:27.854
But what I want...

35:30.440 --> 35:33.735
What I want, what I need...

35:35.195 --> 35:37.697
...is a choice.

35:38.365 --> 35:42.369
What does that mean?

35:44.204 --> 35:49.251
Sometimes I feel like I never
actually...

35:49.459 --> 35:53.088
...make any of my own choices...

35:53.296 --> 35:55.048
...I mean.

36:01.012 --> 36:02.514
My entire life...

36:04.099 --> 36:06.268
...it just seems I never...

36:09.312 --> 36:13.692
...you know, had a real say
about any of it.

36:16.695 --> 36:19.990
Now, this last one, cancer...

36:21.825 --> 36:26.037
...all I have left is
how I choose to approach this.

36:26.246 --> 36:29.207
Then make the right choice, Walt.

36:30.041 --> 36:32.961
You are not the only one it affects.

36:33.962 --> 36:35.589
What about your son?

36:37.340 --> 36:41.470
Don't you wanna see your daughter
grow up? I just...

36:46.475 --> 36:48.560
Of course I do.

36:50.437 --> 36:55.108
Skyler, you've read the statistics,
you...

37:00.113 --> 37:01.907
These doctors...

37:02.115 --> 37:05.076
...talking about "surviving"...

37:05.285 --> 37:09.790
...one year, two years,
like it's the only thing that matters.

37:09.998 --> 37:17.005
But what good is it to just survive
if I am too sick to work?

37:18.090 --> 37:20.675
To enjoy a meal?

37:22.761 --> 37:24.596
To make love?

37:31.520 --> 37:34.356
For what time I have left...

37:36.650 --> 37:38.902
...I wanna live in my own house.

37:39.111 --> 37:41.905
I wanna sleep in my own bed.

37:42.114 --> 37:45.659
I don't wanna choke down
30 or 40 pills every single day...

37:45.867 --> 37:47.077
...and lose my hair...

37:47.661 --> 37:51.998
...and lie around,
too tired to get up...

37:54.167 --> 37:58.171
...and so nauseated
that I can't even move my head.

38:00.257 --> 38:02.050
And you.

38:02.509 --> 38:04.928
Cleaning up after me.

38:07.180 --> 38:09.182
And me? What...?

38:09.933 --> 38:11.852
Some...

38:12.060 --> 38:16.731
Some dead man,
some artificially-alive...

38:17.315 --> 38:20.652
Just marking time.

38:22.195 --> 38:24.364
No. No.

38:27.909 --> 38:30.996
And that's
how you would remember me.

38:37.043 --> 38:39.379
That's the worst part.

38:42.382 --> 38:48.388
So that is my thought process,
Skyler.

38:50.015 --> 38:52.726
I'm sorry. I just...

38:56.897 --> 39:00.233
I choose not to do it.

40:54.723 --> 40:56.475
All right.

40:59.728 --> 41:01.897
"All right" what?

41:05.150 --> 41:07.611
I'll do the treatment.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.936
It's gonna be okay.

41:41.436 --> 41:43.271
Okay.

42:08.922 --> 42:10.549
The lady from the billing office...

42:10.757 --> 42:13.677
...said they usually bill
the insurance company directly.

42:13.885 --> 42:19.057
But since our HMO's not paying for it,
we can pay up front with a credit card.

42:19.266 --> 42:21.143
Good.

42:21.685 --> 42:26.231
Oh, and then Elliott
will send a check.

42:26.440 --> 42:29.151
I will take care of it.

42:34.156 --> 42:35.907
Walter White?

42:36.408 --> 42:38.201
Yes.

42:40.328 --> 42:42.205
Okay.

42:42.789 --> 42:44.040
- All right.
- Okay.

42:44.249 --> 42:45.542
- See you in a minute.
- Okay.

42:45.751 --> 42:47.002
Okay.

44:18.093 --> 44:19.594
Elliott.

44:19.803 --> 44:22.180
<i>Walt, it's Gretchen.</i>

44:23.557 --> 44:25.058
Oh, hey.

44:25.267 --> 44:26.935
Hey, Gretchen, how are you?

44:27.144 --> 44:30.981
<i>You know, it was really great seeing
you two the other day, you know.</i>

44:31.189 --> 44:33.733
Wow, what a party.

44:34.609 --> 44:38.071
Elliott told me about the cancer.

44:38.280 --> 44:41.575
I'm so sorry.

44:43.410 --> 44:44.536
<i>Well, you know...</i>

44:45.162 --> 44:47.372
...it is what it is, I guess.

44:47.581 --> 44:49.666
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

44:49.875 --> 44:52.878
Except, I'm always here for you.

44:53.503 --> 44:56.923
<i>Both of us are.
We wanted you to know that.</i>

44:58.300 --> 45:00.886
Yeah, well, thank you.

45:02.220 --> 45:07.225
<i>Walt, Elliott told me that he'd offered
to pay for the treatment.</i>

45:07.434 --> 45:08.518
<i>You have to accept.</i>

45:08.727 --> 45:10.854
That money,
as far as we're both concerned...

45:11.062 --> 45:13.315
...that belongs to you.

45:13.523 --> 45:17.068
Even the name of our company,
it's half yours.

45:19.571 --> 45:20.739
<i>Walt?</i>

45:23.784 --> 45:26.787
Is this about you and me?

45:39.007 --> 45:41.384
Gretchen, I really appreciate
the offer.

45:41.593 --> 45:45.097
<i>I do. But we're fine.</i>

45:46.264 --> 45:49.726
As it turns out,
the insurance came through after all.

45:49.935 --> 45:51.812
So...

45:52.020 --> 45:55.440
...I am covered. And...

45:55.816 --> 45:58.568
<i>Well, and, anyway,
I really appreciate it, I really do.</i>

45:58.777 --> 46:00.529
<i>Thank you.</i>

46:01.404 --> 46:03.907
Good. That's good news.

46:05.617 --> 46:08.620
You know,
that really was a great party.

46:11.706 --> 46:16.336
- Keep in touch, okay?
- Sure. Sure, and...

46:16.545 --> 46:18.797
...thank you for calling.

47:07.554 --> 47:08.722
Yo!

47:17.481 --> 47:19.024
Wanna cook?
