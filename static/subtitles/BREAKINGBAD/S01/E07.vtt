"Breaking Bad Season 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 + Extras BDRip DVDRip HDTV TSV"

00:03.894 --> 00:07.368
In closing, I can tell you
we take this very seriously.

00:07.485 --> 00:10.059
APD as well as the DEA.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.724
Stopping the manufacture
and sale of methamphetamines

00:12.725 --> 00:14.655
remains one of
our highest priorities.

00:14.662 --> 00:17.649
And the theft of lab equipment
from your school is also receiving

00:17.650 --> 00:19.038
our highest attention.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.956
Rest assured, no stone
will go unturned

00:21.979 --> 00:25.165
in our search for the person or persons
responsible for this.

00:25.170 --> 00:27.732
If you have any questions,
now would be the time.

00:27.898 --> 00:31.320
You're talking like you haven't
caught anybody yet.

00:31.373 --> 00:33.966
What about the janitor
that was dealing drugs at the school?

00:33.971 --> 00:37.782
There is no indication that
this individual was selling drugs.

00:37.854 --> 00:41.728
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana in his car,

00:41.748 --> 00:43.330
not in the school.

00:43.367 --> 00:45.274
And he's since been fired.

00:45.286 --> 00:46.984
I heard he had a record.

00:47.025 --> 00:49.446
I'd like to know how he got
a job here in the first place.

00:49.467 --> 00:52.603
- Why wasn't there a background check?
- There was one.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.878
We're currently reviewing
our hiring policies.

00:55.890 --> 00:59.509
You better be doing more than that.
He was arrested in front of my daughter.

00:59.534 --> 01:01.758
This guy was stealing
the lab equipment, right?

01:01.777 --> 01:03.809
That's not our thinking
at this time.

01:03.847 --> 01:07.511
We are looking at others who had access,
not limited to the maintenance staff.

01:07.518 --> 01:10.997
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know exactly when this happened?

01:11.001 --> 01:13.268
I mean, could it have been
during school hours?

01:13.331 --> 01:15.527
We haven't been able
to establish a date or time,

01:15.540 --> 01:18.262
but there is no sign
of breaking or entering.

01:18.332 --> 01:20.498
Whoever took it had a key?

01:21.025 --> 01:24.676
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

01:24.702 --> 01:28.667
At this time I'm not able to discuss
the details, but what I can tell you

01:28.701 --> 01:31.793
is that we have some very good people
working very hard on this case.

01:31.811 --> 01:34.484
I'm sorry, Officer.
But that sounds like double-talk.

01:34.489 --> 01:37.523
We're trying to protect our children.
You have to level with us.

01:37.543 --> 01:40.603
Really, we are giving you
all the information we have.

01:40.628 --> 01:44.140
You know what I'd like to see
in this school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

01:44.267 --> 01:46.475
Yeah, dogs, and metal detectors,

01:46.481 --> 01:48.439
and locker searches,
and strip searches.

01:48.458 --> 01:51.870
- Our district has strict policies...
- I heard about this school in Canada.

01:51.928 --> 01:54.731
They arrested one of their
groundskeepers with drugs.

01:54.848 --> 01:58.496
And the next day they found out over
half of the students were high on LSD.

01:58.506 --> 02:01.427
LSD? When were you gonna
tell us about the LSD?

02:01.478 --> 02:04.929
No. Please.
No one said anything about LSD.

02:09.186 --> 02:11.370
What about the equipment
that was stolen?

02:11.399 --> 02:14.716
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry department.

02:15.294 --> 02:19.290
And I would like someone
to give us some specifics.

02:19.772 --> 02:20.794
Walt?

02:23.217 --> 02:24.050
Yeah.

02:24.677 --> 02:28.286
Mr. White is currently
on medical leave.

02:28.744 --> 02:31.129
But as he's chair
of the science department,

02:31.131 --> 02:34.402
he's made a very special
effort to be with us here.

02:34.705 --> 02:38.397
And I'd like to take
a moment to thank him for that.

02:46.220 --> 02:50.119
Could you please tell us more
about the equipment that was taken?

02:50.574 --> 02:52.290
- Please.
- Yes.

02:55.973 --> 02:57.614
And thank you.

03:02.237 --> 03:05.465
The inventory list for
the missing labware is as follows:

03:05.471 --> 03:08.466
one 5,000 milliliter

03:08.937 --> 03:10.931
round bottom boiling flask,

03:10.960 --> 03:14.883
one Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters,

03:15.744 --> 03:17.889
two full-face respirators,

03:18.798 --> 03:20.549
some sep funnels,

03:20.564 --> 03:23.102
a sill head with
a thermometer holder...

03:29.971 --> 03:31.460
Ow, my knee.

03:34.999 --> 03:37.955
Where... did that come from?

03:38.628 --> 03:41.127
And why was it so damn good?

03:42.962 --> 03:45.102
Because it was illegal.

03:46.876 --> 03:49.876
"A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal"

04:23.769 --> 04:25.195
The basement.

04:25.363 --> 04:26.751
Unfinished, of course.

04:26.754 --> 04:28.710
But just look at all this space.

04:28.723 --> 04:32.068
You gotta think
rec room, media room.

04:32.070 --> 04:34.908
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

04:35.325 --> 04:38.926
Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neighborhood.

04:38.953 --> 04:41.317
Big lawns and shade tress.

04:41.325 --> 04:43.735
Walking distance
to the country club.

04:50.363 --> 04:52.041
What happened there?

04:53.259 --> 04:56.755
Bit of a fixer, but this house
has great bones.

05:01.788 --> 05:04.364
You know what? We're zeroing in.
I've got another listing,

05:04.373 --> 05:06.556
brand-new, right around the corner.

05:07.414 --> 05:08.247
Hi.

05:08.478 --> 05:09.462
Hi.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.241
It's by appointment only.

05:12.592 --> 05:14.460
I'm here to see the owner.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.508
He's in the...

05:18.951 --> 05:20.818
recreational vehicle.

05:25.830 --> 05:28.154
Yo, it's appointment only!

05:41.313 --> 05:42.907
How you feeling?

05:45.730 --> 05:47.762
About as good as you look.

05:47.915 --> 05:51.498
Jeez, you look like... Lex Luthor.

05:52.801 --> 05:55.784
Listen, I visited you in the hospital,
but you were asleep.

05:55.873 --> 05:59.052
Yeah, Skinny Pete said
you wanted Tuco's address.

05:59.128 --> 06:02.124
Acting like you were
all out for blood.

06:02.225 --> 06:06.011
You are alive,
so obviously you wised up.

06:06.136 --> 06:08.786
- No, I did go see him.
- Bullshit.

06:08.819 --> 06:10.576
Are you selling your house?

06:10.607 --> 06:12.484
I got two dudes that turned into

06:12.486 --> 06:15.242
raspberry slushie and
flushed down my toilet.

06:15.336 --> 06:17.787
I can't even take
a proper dump in there.

06:17.862 --> 06:21.055
The whole damn house
has got to be haunted by now.

06:22.084 --> 06:24.709
You didn't actually go see Tuco?

06:25.947 --> 06:26.755
Here.

06:30.207 --> 06:32.567
That is seventeen-five.

06:32.617 --> 06:34.779
Your half of the 35,000.

06:34.855 --> 06:38.053
Plus there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours.

06:38.146 --> 06:39.614
You've earned it.

06:39.686 --> 06:41.329
You got this money from Tuco.

06:41.409 --> 06:42.174
Yeah.

06:42.190 --> 06:44.918
So Tuco gave you this
is what you're saying.

06:45.087 --> 06:48.135
- We made a deal.
- You made a deal?

06:48.202 --> 06:49.918
- That's right.
- Wait.

06:50.456 --> 06:53.183
Why would you make
a deal with that scumbag?

06:53.201 --> 06:54.759
You see what he did to me?

06:54.765 --> 06:57.408
Because I think that
we can do business together.

06:57.410 --> 06:59.605
We came to an understanding.

06:59.637 --> 07:02.034
No way, man! Okay?
No understanding.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.166
Take a look at
the money in your hand.

07:04.217 --> 07:07.580
Now just imagine
making that every week.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.314
That's right.

07:09.350 --> 07:12.684
Two pounds a week.
35,000 a pound.

07:12.692 --> 07:15.527
Without even talking to me,
you told...

07:15.679 --> 07:18.699
this insane ass clown

07:19.330 --> 07:22.359
dead-eyed killer that, uh...

07:22.736 --> 07:24.944
that we would give him
two pounds a week?

07:24.946 --> 07:26.645
We'll just scale up
our operation.

07:26.651 --> 07:29.306
- We'll add a few more hours...
- Don't talk to me about hours.

07:29.308 --> 07:32.829
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

07:33.094 --> 07:36.481
You think the meth fairy
is just gonna bring it to us?

07:37.013 --> 07:39.563
It takes me a week
to get this stuff.

07:39.797 --> 07:42.052
I'm driving all the way
out to Las Cruces.

07:42.065 --> 07:44.862
200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs...

07:44.874 --> 07:48.322
- Smurfs?
- Dudes who go to the drugstores

07:48.329 --> 07:51.188
and get a couple boxes
at a time and then sell them to me.

07:51.222 --> 07:54.561
And that's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

07:54.700 --> 07:58.681
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

07:58.695 --> 07:59.522
All right.

07:59.525 --> 08:03.282
Of course you would have known that
if you would have just asked me.

08:05.091 --> 08:06.845
Well, here we are again.

08:07.009 --> 08:08.583
Here we are.

08:08.903 --> 08:10.712
- Skyler, you look great.
- Thank you.

08:10.728 --> 08:13.246
You must be, what,
six, seven months?

08:13.741 --> 08:14.977
How goes it?

08:15.078 --> 08:16.340
It's great...

08:16.910 --> 08:20.229
other than waddling to the bathroom
every five minutes.

08:21.232 --> 08:24.333
The baby shower's next week.
It'll be good to...

08:25.368 --> 08:27.336
It'll be good
to have a day that's...

08:27.386 --> 08:29.128
just about Skyler.

08:29.140 --> 08:30.298
Very nice.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.216
Thank you.

08:33.421 --> 08:35.985
Well, Walt, I see you've
committed to the hair loss.

08:36.037 --> 08:36.980
Yeah.

08:37.792 --> 08:40.033
- How do you feel?
- Oh, okay.

08:41.210 --> 08:43.544
You know, pretty decent actually.

08:43.582 --> 08:46.797
His color is better.
You know, his energy.

08:46.890 --> 08:49.614
And he's even more...

08:50.715 --> 08:51.823
physical.

08:51.838 --> 08:53.276
More physical?

08:53.573 --> 08:55.566
Well... sexual.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.467
Frisky, actually.

09:01.052 --> 09:03.176
I mean, that's got
to be a good sign, right?

09:03.180 --> 09:04.693
Sure, I'll take that.

09:04.707 --> 09:05.994
Right, Walt?

09:06.352 --> 09:09.094
Couldn't that mean that
the chemo is working?

09:09.202 --> 09:13.150
Realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the anti-emetics tuned right.

09:13.209 --> 09:16.547
Truth is, until Walt's finished
this round of chemo

09:16.550 --> 09:19.859
and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

09:19.938 --> 09:22.222
Isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

09:22.273 --> 09:24.472
I've been wondering about...

09:24.565 --> 09:25.969
alternative medicine.

09:26.019 --> 09:28.177
I mean, Eastern healing.

09:29.563 --> 09:31.519
You know, holistic.

09:31.608 --> 09:34.052
Well, I can't speak
to its efficacy.

09:34.132 --> 09:37.231
But as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment,

09:37.291 --> 09:40.082
anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook,

09:40.086 --> 09:43.014
a better comfort, is fine by me.

09:44.039 --> 09:47.497
So you're saying
it's all psychological.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.057
It doesn't make
any real difference.

09:51.070 --> 09:54.615
Having a better outlook
can make a tremendous difference.

09:54.670 --> 09:58.482
But it's also important
that we manage our expectations.

10:19.111 --> 10:20.020
What?

10:25.080 --> 10:26.503
A junkyard?

10:26.927 --> 10:29.801
Let me guess,
you picked this place?

10:30.788 --> 10:33.413
What's wrong with it?
It's private.

10:34.498 --> 10:38.353
This is like... a non-criminal's
idea of a drug meet.

10:38.627 --> 10:42.276
This is like, "Oh, I saw this
in a movie. Oh, look at me."

10:42.350 --> 10:45.420
So where do you transact
your business? Enlighten me.

10:45.446 --> 10:48.220
I don't know.
How about Taco Cabeza?

10:48.461 --> 10:51.427
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

10:51.490 --> 10:53.157
Nice and public.

10:53.623 --> 10:55.452
Open 24 hours.

10:56.134 --> 10:58.891
Nobody ever gets shot
at Taco Cabeza.

10:59.770 --> 11:02.029
Hell, why not the mall?

11:03.027 --> 11:06.434
You know, wait at the Gap.
"Hey! It's time for the meet."

11:06.587 --> 11:09.375
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakis,

11:09.413 --> 11:11.854
head on over,
grab an Orange Julius.

11:11.905 --> 11:15.334
Skip the part
where psycho lunatic Tuco

11:15.410 --> 11:19.127
comes and steals my drugs
and leaves me bleeding to death.

11:28.699 --> 11:31.301
Look, you don't have
to be here for this.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.572
Okay?
I mean, seriously.

11:33.667 --> 11:34.941
I'm okay.

11:37.853 --> 11:39.669
Nah, I'm no pussy.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.474
I'm good.

12:00.281 --> 12:02.287
Mr. Clean and his boy.

12:04.381 --> 12:06.438
I'm sorry that I had
to tune you up.

12:06.451 --> 12:09.441
Respect, ese.
You gotta give it to get it.

12:13.473 --> 12:16.080
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

12:16.123 --> 12:18.798
What, they close
the mall or something?

12:20.618 --> 12:22.978
Heisenberg, come on,
break it out.

12:26.336 --> 12:28.545
That's it?
That's all you got?

12:28.646 --> 12:30.930
We had some production problems.

12:31.270 --> 12:33.257
Point five-three.

12:34.414 --> 12:36.433
I thought you was a player.

12:36.509 --> 12:38.787
You told me two pounds,

12:38.789 --> 12:41.930
and now you waste my time
with these Chiclets?

12:52.997 --> 12:54.587
17½...

12:54.650 --> 12:58.019
minus the half
for wasting my time.

12:58.049 --> 12:59.027
Hey, come on.

12:59.037 --> 13:02.187
What, you're gonna argue?
You got something to say?

13:05.564 --> 13:08.655
You're doing business
like a couple little bitches.

13:09.412 --> 13:10.889
I want all of it.

13:14.435 --> 13:15.772
70 grand.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.359
What did you say?

13:17.379 --> 13:20.485
You like this product,
and you want more.

13:21.183 --> 13:23.580
Consider it a capital investment.

13:26.488 --> 13:28.987
Loco bald motherfucker.

13:33.232 --> 13:35.917
52½.
25 points vig.

13:36.658 --> 13:37.604
Vig?

13:39.684 --> 13:41.753
Interest. Weekly.

13:44.186 --> 13:45.145
Okay.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.517
That's...

13:48.488 --> 13:52.299
$65,625 with interest.

13:52.716 --> 13:55.489
- 1.875 pounds.
- No.

13:55.830 --> 13:57.859
2 pounds.
Next Friday.

13:57.884 --> 14:00.143
And no production problems.

14:02.382 --> 14:04.729
Can you handle 4 pounds?

14:08.248 --> 14:11.327
Listen, old man.
Talk is talk.

14:11.822 --> 14:14.257
But owing me money...

14:14.505 --> 14:16.259
that's bad.

14:37.405 --> 14:41.115
What did you just do?

14:45.016 --> 14:46.455
4 pounds.

14:46.605 --> 14:49.521
4 pounds, as if 2 pounds
wasn't bad enough.

14:50.477 --> 14:53.821
We're talking 200-300
boxes of sinus pills.

14:54.552 --> 14:56.650
There ain't that many
smurfs in the world.

14:56.697 --> 14:59.051
We're not going to need
pseudo ephedrine.

14:59.114 --> 15:02.050
We're going to make phenylacetone
in a tube furnace,

15:02.122 --> 15:06.121
then we're gonna use reductive amination
to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

15:06.389 --> 15:08.534
- So no pseudo?
- No pseudo.

15:09.461 --> 15:11.227
So you do have a plan.

15:11.467 --> 15:13.297
Yeah, Mr. White!

15:13.946 --> 15:15.486
Yeah, science!

15:16.144 --> 15:17.115
Okay.

15:21.184 --> 15:23.972
- What's this?
- That is a shopping list.

15:24.565 --> 15:28.035
Getting some of those items
may be challenging.

15:28.812 --> 15:32.421
"One autotransformer,
6 liters an...

15:33.042 --> 15:36.403
hy... hydrous
methyl... methylamine,

15:36.580 --> 15:39.246
two 35 M&M tube furnaces..."

15:39.249 --> 15:41.072
That's MM: millimeter.

15:41.096 --> 15:44.339
One 70-millimeter would be fine,
but they're hard to come by, so...

15:44.408 --> 15:46.864
"40 grams thorium nitrate"?

15:46.874 --> 15:49.417
Yo, Mr. White, I can't even
pronounce half this shit.

15:49.593 --> 15:51.183
You know what?
Count me out.

15:51.354 --> 15:52.597
I'm leaving town.

15:52.598 --> 15:54.708
I'm moving to, like,
Oregon or something...

15:54.712 --> 15:56.639
Jesse, Jesse, listen to me.

15:57.189 --> 16:01.186
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

16:02.123 --> 16:03.384
What are you doing?

16:03.401 --> 16:05.529
This is the first day
of the rest of your life,

16:05.534 --> 16:07.552
but what kind of life will it be?

16:07.604 --> 16:10.655
Will be be a life of fear,
of "Oh, no, no, no,

16:10.710 --> 16:14.496
"I can't do this," of never once
believing in yourself?

16:15.809 --> 16:17.727
- I don't know.
- Listen.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.575
These things?

16:19.890 --> 16:21.177
We need them.

16:21.326 --> 16:24.203
And only you can get them for us.

16:29.700 --> 16:33.316
Okay, it's ready.
There you go.

16:34.419 --> 16:38.407
Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.

16:39.106 --> 16:42.878
Now, you already know that because
when you watch this 20 years from now,

16:42.880 --> 16:45.652
I will look exactly
the same as I do now.

16:45.765 --> 16:47.500
I know it is amazing.

16:47.564 --> 16:50.617
I have aged shockingly well,
haven't I?

16:51.542 --> 16:52.514
Anyway,

16:52.573 --> 16:56.569
welcome to your
baby shower, Esmeralda!

16:57.214 --> 16:58.460
Esmeralda?

16:58.636 --> 17:00.243
Esmeralda.

17:00.257 --> 17:02.514
That's your name,
and you heard it here first.

17:02.536 --> 17:05.430
Now, that is your wonderful,

17:05.457 --> 17:07.100
handsome older brother.

17:07.107 --> 17:09.299
Show her, older brother,
your face.

17:11.242 --> 17:13.146
Okay. Not right up the nose.

17:13.387 --> 17:15.344
Not...
Back to me.

17:15.496 --> 17:17.931
There's your mommy!

17:18.445 --> 17:20.504
Hello, Mommy!

17:20.529 --> 17:23.886
And look!
There you are, Esmeralda!

17:24.122 --> 17:25.585
Wake up, baby!

17:25.589 --> 17:27.559
Time to party!

17:28.189 --> 17:29.401
Easy.

17:29.663 --> 17:31.970
Believe it or not, Esmeralda,

17:32.718 --> 17:35.923
right after the party,
your name was changed to Holly.

17:35.945 --> 17:38.304
And I believe, Hank,
that that was around the time

17:38.305 --> 17:40.683
that we took Aunt Marie
to the insane asylum.

17:40.689 --> 17:43.254
Yeah, yeah.
I dropped her off at the curb.

17:43.260 --> 17:46.691
Then I married Shania Twain
and lived happily ever after.

17:48.161 --> 17:51.947
There's Daddy!
Speak, Daddy!

17:52.392 --> 17:54.474
Say hello to your daughter.

18:00.619 --> 18:03.155
Holly, I am very proud of you,

18:03.633 --> 18:07.090
and I think about you all the time.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.922
Wherever you go,

18:14.436 --> 18:16.304
whatever you do in life,

18:17.560 --> 18:20.046
always know
that you have a family

18:20.109 --> 18:22.506
who loves you very, very much.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.334
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

18:28.728 --> 18:31.946
Oh, my God, it's so cute.

18:32.263 --> 18:34.423
Oh, Carmen, it's...
Oh, look.

18:34.532 --> 18:37.106
Look at that.
It's adorable.

18:37.327 --> 18:39.425
I love it, Carmen.
Thank you.

18:39.463 --> 18:40.928
You're so welcome, honey.

18:40.941 --> 18:43.387
Thank you.
Look at the little feet.

18:47.685 --> 18:48.871
From me.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.659
And Hank.

18:51.551 --> 18:53.191
What nice wrapping paper.

18:53.192 --> 18:55.533
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

18:55.540 --> 18:56.646
I do.

18:57.164 --> 18:58.072
Okay.

18:58.384 --> 19:01.443
Let's see what this is.

19:01.562 --> 19:02.912
Exciting.

19:04.208 --> 19:06.770
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

19:13.605 --> 19:14.829
It's a...

19:15.401 --> 19:16.669
a tiara.

19:20.271 --> 19:22.214
Marie, is this...

19:22.357 --> 19:26.355
White gold and several carats'
worth of zircons.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.826
Oh, Marie, you spent
too much on this.

19:28.830 --> 19:32.200
You shouldn't have.
You really, really shouldn't.

19:32.660 --> 19:34.907
But it's so...
It's really...

19:34.993 --> 19:37.863
It's... sparkly.

19:39.121 --> 19:42.214
Sparkly! Like wow!
Thank you.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.970
Hey, listen, Walt...

19:44.563 --> 19:46.163
You got anything
stronger than beer?

19:46.214 --> 19:48.266
It's just gor...
Oh, it's great.

19:48.268 --> 19:50.368
I love it.
Thank you.

19:50.888 --> 19:53.511
Thank you, sweetie, thank you.

19:54.071 --> 19:55.308
Sorry, man.

19:55.383 --> 19:58.876
You know, after 200 presents,
it just gets kind of old.

20:02.089 --> 20:04.612
- That's nice stuff.
- It is, isn't it?

20:07.583 --> 20:10.574
I got just the thing
to go with that.

20:15.424 --> 20:17.269
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

20:17.279 --> 20:19.218
No, no, no, no.
It's okay.

20:20.467 --> 20:22.369
You mind if I have one?

20:22.831 --> 20:24.572
You think it's a good idea?

20:24.761 --> 20:27.032
Hank, I've already got
lung cancer.

20:28.624 --> 20:30.984
Okay. You got me there.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.622
Thanks.

20:38.032 --> 20:38.965
Cuban.

20:43.617 --> 20:46.090
I did a little favor
for an FBI guy.

20:48.602 --> 20:50.884
Now, I was
under the impression...

20:52.976 --> 20:55.086
that these were illegal, hmm?

20:56.403 --> 20:59.415
Yeah, well,
sometimes forbidden fruit

20:59.453 --> 21:01.838
tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?

21:06.556 --> 21:08.284
It's funny, isn't it?

21:08.519 --> 21:10.784
How we draw that line.

21:10.902 --> 21:11.911
Yeah?

21:12.637 --> 21:14.535
What line is that?

21:15.983 --> 21:18.771
Well, what's legal,
what's illegal,

21:19.693 --> 21:21.836
Cuban cigars, alcohol.

21:22.832 --> 21:25.923
You know, if we were
drinking this in 1930,

21:26.293 --> 21:28.275
we'd be breaking the law.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.975
Another year, we'd be okay.

21:33.506 --> 21:36.105
Who knows what
will be legal next year?

21:37.744 --> 21:39.535
You mean like pot?

21:41.919 --> 21:42.676
Yeah.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.238
Like pot. Or...

21:46.382 --> 21:47.505
whatever.

21:48.915 --> 21:51.148
Cocaine? Heroin?

21:53.627 --> 21:55.878
I'm just saying it's arbitrary.

21:57.310 --> 21:59.248
Well, you ought to visit lockup.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.912
You hear a lot of guys
talking like that.

22:02.058 --> 22:05.896
"Hey, man, why'd you bust me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

22:05.904 --> 22:09.893
"It's all gonna be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president."

22:10.580 --> 22:13.760
Shit, buddy,
it doesn't only go one way, either.

22:14.466 --> 22:17.772
Sometimes there's stuff
that's legal that shouldn't be.

22:17.947 --> 22:21.341
I mean, friggin' meth
used to be legal.

22:22.487 --> 22:26.474
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

22:26.857 --> 22:30.075
Thank God they came to their
senses on that one, huh?

22:32.670 --> 22:33.553
Yeah.

22:47.420 --> 22:48.846
Nice party.

22:52.847 --> 22:54.045
A tiara.

22:55.477 --> 22:59.060
A white gold tiara
for a newborn baby.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.233
Yeah.

23:01.806 --> 23:05.607
You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill.

23:05.658 --> 23:07.893
I mean, that thing
must have cost, like, what,

23:07.903 --> 23:10.793
$500 or $600.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.897
You know what? I think
I'm going to return it.

23:16.977 --> 23:18.158
You sure?

23:18.594 --> 23:20.600
She's bound to find out.

23:20.901 --> 23:24.888
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie more than

23:25.431 --> 23:28.106
a white gold baby tiara.

23:32.568 --> 23:35.576
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli

23:35.581 --> 23:37.462
about alternative medicine.

23:37.471 --> 23:40.008
Don't worry. I'm not going
to mention that anymore.

23:40.079 --> 23:43.362
What I mean is that maybe
there is something to it.

23:44.604 --> 23:46.118
Here. Look.

23:47.197 --> 23:51.176
They do this Navajo sweat lodge
up by Farmington.

23:52.019 --> 23:54.076
Healing ceremony.

23:54.103 --> 23:56.202
It's supposed to be
good for your lungs.

23:56.210 --> 23:58.904
I'm not saying
that I believe in it, but...

23:59.513 --> 24:02.453
you know,
it might be an experience.

24:04.255 --> 24:05.303
Really?

24:06.270 --> 24:07.090
You?

24:08.054 --> 24:09.568
In a sweat lodge?

24:09.602 --> 24:12.789
I was thinking about
driving up on Friday,

24:12.840 --> 24:15.188
coming back Sunday.
I mean, if you're okay with it.

24:15.215 --> 24:17.794
Well, of course
I'm okay with that.

24:18.039 --> 24:18.986
Okay.

24:28.699 --> 24:30.781
- Sweat lodge?
- Yeah.

24:31.187 --> 24:33.559
I'm already sweating.
Help me out.

24:34.689 --> 24:37.263
- Okay.
- Right.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.775
70-millimeter tube furnace.
Excellent.

24:42.796 --> 24:44.587
This is excellent.
Very good work.

24:44.599 --> 24:46.451
- Damn straight.
- Okay. Hydrogen.

24:46.476 --> 24:48.236
Electrolytically produced, yes?

24:48.273 --> 24:50.105
Yeah, like you asked. I mean,

24:50.240 --> 24:52.119
this crap wasn't easy to get.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.863
It was expensive.

24:54.098 --> 24:56.029
Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

24:56.034 --> 24:57.922
I don't see the methylamine.

24:57.925 --> 25:01.251
Yeah, well, that's where
I ran into some trouble.

25:01.927 --> 25:03.584
What kind of trouble?

25:03.748 --> 25:06.598
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

25:06.921 --> 25:08.790
But this methylamine...

25:09.441 --> 25:10.629
not so easy.

25:10.633 --> 25:12.720
They got it locked down tight.

25:12.813 --> 25:16.214
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

25:16.417 --> 25:18.768
But they want 10 grand.

25:18.913 --> 25:21.058
So what's the problem?
You have the money.

25:21.082 --> 25:24.065
No, had. I already spent
almost the whole wad.

25:24.075 --> 25:28.067
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

25:28.521 --> 25:32.512
So these thieves, did they say where
they would be stealing it from?

25:32.748 --> 25:35.512
Yeah, a chemical supply
place south of town.

25:35.532 --> 25:37.946
They got guards
and security cameras,

25:37.966 --> 25:39.689
big ass steel doors.

25:39.696 --> 25:42.709
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

25:43.417 --> 25:44.174
What?

25:58.490 --> 26:01.932
So why don't we
just steal it ourselves?

26:04.000 --> 26:04.984
Yeah?

26:05.662 --> 26:07.769
How are we going to do that?

26:09.113 --> 26:10.249
With this.

26:25.279 --> 26:27.735
So what's this
stuff called again?

26:30.742 --> 26:31.977
Thermite.

26:32.463 --> 26:34.646
And that will cut through a lock?

26:34.892 --> 26:37.656
Because this is supposed
to be one big ass lock.

26:37.786 --> 26:39.793
In World War II,

26:40.436 --> 26:44.396
the Germans had an artillery piece,
it's the biggest in the world,

26:44.534 --> 26:46.513
called the Gustav Gun,

26:46.667 --> 26:49.308
and it weighed a thousand tons.

26:49.520 --> 26:53.413
And the Gustav was capable
of firing a 7-ton shell

26:54.058 --> 26:58.045
and hitting a target
accurately 23 miles away.

26:59.605 --> 27:02.243
I mean, you could
drop bombs on it

27:02.247 --> 27:05.840
every day for a month
without ever disabling it.

27:06.954 --> 27:09.854
But you drop a commando,

27:10.725 --> 27:12.012
one man,

27:12.447 --> 27:14.365
with just a bag of this...

27:17.078 --> 27:20.124
and he could melt right through
4 inches of solid steel

27:20.126 --> 27:22.549
and destroy that gun forever.

27:25.511 --> 27:26.647
Jeez!

27:30.267 --> 27:31.440
So yes.

27:33.006 --> 27:36.924
I think it will cut through any lock
we're likely to find.

27:37.742 --> 27:39.211
You'd like to return this?

27:39.217 --> 27:41.858
It's very nice, but yes.

27:42.625 --> 27:44.946
Well, it is from
the store, isn't it?

27:45.043 --> 27:47.301
Oh, yes.
It's from this store.

27:47.855 --> 27:49.861
Do you happen to have a receipt?

27:50.217 --> 27:52.690
No. I don't.
It was a gift.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.373
A gift.

27:54.811 --> 27:57.587
Mr. Wilson, could you
step over here, please?

27:59.588 --> 28:03.481
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
this lady while I phone the police.

28:04.235 --> 28:05.300
Excuse me?

28:05.398 --> 28:08.603
Ma'am, this item is stolen,
as I'm sure you know.

28:09.393 --> 28:11.210
Come with me, please.

28:13.704 --> 28:16.732
Oh, yes. I intend
to press charges.

28:18.759 --> 28:19.945
Please do.

28:21.299 --> 28:22.611
We'll be here.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.367
Look, I...

28:26.038 --> 28:29.247
I've never stolen anything
in my life, all right?

28:29.417 --> 28:30.815
I told you.

28:30.863 --> 28:34.602
That tiara was a gift.
A baby shower gift.

28:34.606 --> 28:36.775
So who gave it to you, then?

28:38.781 --> 28:42.119
- I don't think I have to tell you that.
- You don't have to tell me anything.

28:42.169 --> 28:43.916
You can talk to the police,

28:44.190 --> 28:46.752
and I can tell them how
my daughter-in-law remembers

28:46.758 --> 28:50.221
showing this particular item
to a tall blonde woman who,

28:50.225 --> 28:53.358
when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

28:53.396 --> 28:54.512
So there.

28:54.596 --> 28:55.980
Oh, yeah?

28:56.429 --> 28:59.131
Then I can talk
to the Channel 3 News.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.313
Yeah. I can tell them
how you people,

29:02.407 --> 29:05.335
without a shred,
without a modicum of evidence,

29:05.351 --> 29:09.250
illegally detained
an innocent pregnant woman

29:09.262 --> 29:11.512
in a dank storeroom.

29:11.563 --> 29:15.182
- This is my office.
- I feel I'm being held hostage.

29:15.371 --> 29:19.359
Furthermore, I'm not getting
enough air back here.

29:20.348 --> 29:22.430
I don't think I can breathe.

29:22.859 --> 29:24.017
Oh, my God.

29:24.105 --> 29:26.493
Oh, no.
I'm going into labor.

29:26.607 --> 29:27.919
Yes, I...

29:39.193 --> 29:41.532
Hi. You've reached Marie.
Do the beep thing.

29:41.570 --> 29:44.932
Marie? It's Skyler.
I just left Zachary's.

29:45.034 --> 29:47.646
I need to talk to you
immediately.

29:50.431 --> 29:53.409
Where's the guard?
He's supposed to be coming by.

29:53.712 --> 29:56.748
- You think he already passed?
- I don't know.

29:58.152 --> 30:00.436
- There he is.
- Yeah, I see him.

30:00.630 --> 30:02.223
Wait till he passes.

30:02.477 --> 30:03.953
Okay, it's clear.

30:12.354 --> 30:14.876
- What the hell is this?
- It's all they had.

30:14.882 --> 30:16.516
Then you go to another store.

30:16.522 --> 30:19.548
- If this is all they had, wrong place.
- Just put it on.

30:19.557 --> 30:21.267
Of course you can...

30:30.778 --> 30:32.603
Okay.
This is it.

30:35.121 --> 30:36.244
Oh, God.

30:52.916 --> 30:55.200
- Dawm. Where... Duck. Duck.
- What?

30:58.339 --> 31:01.433
He's not supposed to come back.
What's he doing?

31:01.910 --> 31:03.184
Oh, God.

31:05.962 --> 31:07.716
He's going to the crapper.

31:07.753 --> 31:08.802
Oh, God.

31:10.434 --> 31:13.311
- Carry your bag.
- What? What are you doing?

31:46.126 --> 31:47.665
Okay, there is it.

31:49.726 --> 31:51.479
Is this going to be loud?

31:51.489 --> 31:53.851
We'll find out
in about ten seconds.

31:55.209 --> 31:56.370
Stand back.

31:59.756 --> 32:00.715
Jesus!

32:17.221 --> 32:18.691
What's going on?

32:22.401 --> 32:25.265
- Where are the gallon jugs?
- I don't know.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.623
- God!
- What?

32:28.282 --> 32:30.806
Let's just take this.
Come on. Come on.

32:40.643 --> 32:42.729
What the hell are you doing
opening the door?

32:42.735 --> 32:45.406
How are we going to
take this thing out?

33:23.679 --> 33:26.188
- How is it going to be any different?
- Can I just try it?

33:26.266 --> 33:28.751
- Fine, fine, go ahead.
- Jesus. Okay.

33:30.364 --> 33:31.323
All right.

33:37.708 --> 33:40.687
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat it, okay?

33:40.712 --> 33:42.716
I'm the king.
I'm the king.

33:46.089 --> 33:48.663
No, no, no.
That didn't sound good.

33:54.588 --> 33:56.757
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

33:56.774 --> 34:00.471
We're not cooking in my damn driveway.
I tell you that.

34:07.753 --> 34:10.225
What part of slow it down
did you not understand?

34:10.230 --> 34:13.964
You talk too much. It's heavy, man.
You got to wait for me.

34:14.857 --> 34:15.809
Okay.

34:16.339 --> 34:19.024
That's good, that's good.
Now just bring it up.

34:20.312 --> 34:21.751
Easy, easy, easy.

34:22.118 --> 34:23.140
Okay.

34:23.623 --> 34:27.143
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

34:27.494 --> 34:28.683
Shit.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.993
Yo, I don't know.

34:31.304 --> 34:33.487
I'll make damn sure she doesn't.

34:36.039 --> 34:37.963
Good call, yo.

34:40.108 --> 34:41.307
All right.

35:11.921 --> 35:15.585
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

35:16.257 --> 35:18.695
We'll need to run it
two more hours

35:18.705 --> 35:21.031
to have enough to make 4½ pounds.

35:21.352 --> 35:23.560
4½? Not 4?

35:23.655 --> 35:25.858
2 pounds pays Tuco back.

35:27.063 --> 35:31.051
4½ pounds puts us
$44,000 ahead...

35:31.353 --> 35:32.291
each.

35:32.340 --> 35:33.955
Right on, man.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.069
Right on.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.914
With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night,

35:38.990 --> 35:41.737
we could make
4½ pounds a week for...

35:42.207 --> 35:44.849
well, for the foreseeable future.

35:46.231 --> 35:49.045
How long is that going to be?

35:49.500 --> 35:52.213
I mean in your situation.

35:53.089 --> 35:55.235
How much cash do you need?

35:57.079 --> 35:58.277
More.

36:04.150 --> 36:05.866
Someone's in my yard.

36:32.963 --> 36:36.953
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon an open house?

36:37.939 --> 36:40.571
I left them a message, man.
It's not my fault.

36:40.572 --> 36:43.894
I don't care how you do it. Just keep
them out of here. Do you understand?

36:43.932 --> 36:45.741
- Yeah.
- Go.

37:15.216 --> 37:17.260
You know you can't
duck me forever.

37:17.368 --> 37:18.239
What?

37:18.779 --> 37:21.302
Come on. I left you,
like, 15 messages.

37:21.392 --> 37:23.735
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back way.

37:23.742 --> 37:27.015
I didn't sneak.
I was going to lunch.

37:27.103 --> 37:29.929
Jeez, Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

37:30.134 --> 37:33.451
Marie, I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

37:36.191 --> 37:38.059
That tiara.

37:39.384 --> 37:43.372
They accused me at Zachary's
of shoplifting it.

37:43.708 --> 37:45.942
What were you doing at Zachary's?

37:46.763 --> 37:48.378
I was returning it.

37:49.391 --> 37:51.322
You were returning it.

37:52.641 --> 37:54.210
Why would you return it?

37:54.247 --> 37:55.554
It just wasn't...

37:56.755 --> 37:59.518
Marie, what is wrong with you?

37:59.523 --> 38:01.055
Can you please tell me that?

38:01.064 --> 38:04.065
Can you tell me why
you'd do such a thing?

38:07.935 --> 38:11.153
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

38:11.458 --> 38:14.336
That means that

38:14.585 --> 38:17.944
I have no idea what the hell
you're even talking about.

38:18.050 --> 38:21.089
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

38:21.228 --> 38:24.789
The shop...
The shoplifting.

38:25.317 --> 38:26.453
No idea?

38:28.875 --> 38:31.713
You're not going
to admit this, are you?

38:33.370 --> 38:36.720
I can't really admit to something

38:36.724 --> 38:40.555
when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

38:59.846 --> 39:01.836
Don't forget to sign in.

39:07.835 --> 39:09.577
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

39:27.918 --> 39:30.531
Excuse me. I'd just like
to see the basement.

39:30.617 --> 39:33.194
- Yeah, well, it's occupied.
- It's not a bathroom.

39:33.873 --> 39:36.560
I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?

39:36.921 --> 39:40.069
Yo, you ain't seeing
the basement, bitch. You got that?

39:40.078 --> 39:42.092
Is that sinking in?
Now beat it.

39:42.154 --> 39:44.615
All of you all.
House is not for sale.

39:44.874 --> 39:46.539
Get the hell out!

40:31.407 --> 40:32.946
So how was it?

40:33.553 --> 40:34.827
Was it a...

40:35.515 --> 40:37.263
an experience?

40:37.799 --> 40:38.682
Yeah.

40:39.323 --> 40:41.606
It was definitely an experience.

40:48.435 --> 40:50.052
What's that smell?

40:51.954 --> 40:53.305
Yeah. It's...

40:54.215 --> 40:56.637
sacred Navajo herbs and...

41:11.400 --> 41:13.781
Hey, is everything okay?

41:14.861 --> 41:17.271
No. Not really.

41:19.677 --> 41:21.633
Actually, not at all.

41:24.580 --> 41:28.177
You know that tiara
that Marie gave us?

41:28.252 --> 41:29.199
Yeah.

41:29.791 --> 41:32.075
Well, she stole it.

41:33.012 --> 41:33.958
Yeah.

41:34.212 --> 41:37.808
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

41:38.478 --> 41:39.788
Oh, my God.

41:39.880 --> 41:43.727
She refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologize.

41:43.739 --> 41:45.793
I don't know what to do.

41:50.450 --> 41:51.523
Oh, well.

41:52.809 --> 41:56.203
People sometimes do things
for their families.

41:58.723 --> 42:02.018
People sometimes do things
for their families?

42:02.496 --> 42:05.058
And, what,
that justifies stealing?

42:06.731 --> 42:07.755
Yeah.

42:09.484 --> 42:12.046
That must have
been some sweat lodge.

42:13.134 --> 42:16.815
Have you been listening
to the words coming out of your mouth?

42:19.840 --> 42:22.616
What would you do if it were me?

42:25.029 --> 42:27.275
What do you mean if it were you?

42:27.953 --> 42:30.350
If it were me, what would you do?

42:30.879 --> 42:34.494
Would you divorce me?
Would you turn me in to the police?

42:44.894 --> 42:47.010
You don't want to find out.

42:58.332 --> 43:00.439
Do you want something to eat?

43:04.305 --> 43:05.958
No, thanks.

43:22.373 --> 43:24.670
What is this shit?
This is blue.

43:26.670 --> 43:30.544
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

43:30.993 --> 43:33.655
It may be blue,
but it's the bomb.

43:41.757 --> 43:43.687
Tight! Tight, tight, yeah!

43:44.998 --> 43:46.677
Blue, yellow, pink.

43:47.001 --> 43:49.702
Whatever, man.
Just keep bringing me that.

43:59.190 --> 44:00.313
4.6.

44:02.236 --> 44:03.283
Come on.

44:04.796 --> 44:07.711
And what did I say, man?
This guy can cook!

44:08.183 --> 44:10.306
You're all right, man.
You're all right.

44:10.311 --> 44:13.135
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

44:13.973 --> 44:16.509
Just remember
who you're working for.

44:19.438 --> 44:20.928
What did you say?

44:21.725 --> 44:24.968
I'm just saying they got to know
that they're working for you.

44:25.052 --> 44:27.713
Like they don't
already know that?

44:28.218 --> 44:30.590
Are you saying
that they're stupid?

44:31.950 --> 44:34.260
No, I'm just...
I'm just saying.

44:34.757 --> 44:37.281
Oh, yeah. So you're not
saying that they're stupid.

44:37.345 --> 44:40.433
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

44:40.474 --> 44:43.143
No. Come on, Tuco.
I'm just saying.

44:43.148 --> 44:45.412
No, you're just speaking for me!

44:45.462 --> 44:49.222
Like I ain't got the damn sense
to speak for myself!

44:50.072 --> 44:52.885
Is that it? Is that
what you're doing?

44:53.614 --> 44:54.457
Tuco.

44:58.238 --> 45:01.847
Hey, why don't we
all just relax, huh?

45:09.236 --> 45:11.545
Heisenberg says relax.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.415
Orale, homes.

45:18.354 --> 45:19.667
I'm relaxed.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.952
I'm relaxed.
I'm relaxed.

45:38.868 --> 45:41.170
Damn, man!
Look at that! Look!

45:43.903 --> 45:46.174
Yeah. That's messed up.

45:48.183 --> 45:49.910
Okay, Heisenberg!

45:50.777 --> 45:52.102
Next week.
