WEBVTT

00:20.604 --> 00:22.355
Are you okay?

01:55.532 --> 01:57.241
You are a lifesaver.
-Yeah, man.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.785
Yeah, we can't
thank you enough.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.203
No, hey, mad...
Mad props.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.163
I could have sworn
the guy said south.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.874
But then all of a sudden
we're off the main road

02:05.042 --> 02:06.876
then I'm trying to read the map
while I'm driving,

02:07.044 --> 02:08.252
which is a bonehead maneuver.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.339
And then all of a sudden, bam,
we're... We're in that ditch.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.966
Yeah, bam. I'm like,
"What the hell?" You know?

02:14.134 --> 02:17.929
Yes. Oh, yes, and my coffee
mug. Of coffee? My mug of coffee.

02:18.096 --> 02:21.808
It spills all over my pants,
I mean... Just a nightmare.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.768
There's your Sony GPS,
I mean, for real.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.827
Let's just...

02:47.709 --> 02:52.505
Like I said,
we couldn't be more grateful.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.397
Can't we just
dump them here?

03:09.565 --> 03:11.274
What,
and somebody finds them?

03:11.441 --> 03:12.650
Then what?

03:12.818 --> 03:14.694
People have seen us.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.869
Hey, you're... You're
gonna flood it, man.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.454
I'm not gonna flood it. She's
not going to flood, all right?

03:25.622 --> 03:28.124
We're just gonna stay positive,
right?

03:28.292 --> 03:31.711
We're gonna clean up
this mess. And you, start.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.380
Goddamn it. See, you flooded it.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.965
All right.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.594
All right. You know what?
The RV is going to start now.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.512
The RV is going to start
right now.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.390
It's gonna start and we're gonna
drive it over to your house.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.725
My house?
Yes. Your house.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.811
We're gonna drive it over there and
park it overnight. And then tomorrow...

03:48.979 --> 03:50.646
Uh-uh, man, not my house.

03:50.814 --> 03:54.025
Shut up! Shut up!

04:06.163 --> 04:09.957
After we finish
cleaning up this mess,

04:10.125 --> 04:11.959
we will go our separate ways.

04:12.127 --> 04:15.004
Our paths will never cross.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.465
And we will tell this to no one.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.175
Understood?

04:22.012 --> 04:23.846
Oh, what, I can talk now?

04:24.848 --> 04:29.352
Fine. That goes double for me.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.191
Okay. Okay.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.109
Be good to me.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.033
Yes!

04:49.706 --> 04:51.332
Yes. Okay. Okay.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.875
Thank you.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.480
Oh, shit.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.717
Walt?

05:45.470 --> 05:47.346
You coming out?

05:51.143 --> 05:52.518
Mm-hm.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.774
Yeah, absolutely.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.527
We got looky-loos
in both directions, Dan.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.113
Better plan on being late if
you're going in that direction.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.865
This is Lisa in the Skycopter,

06:06.033 --> 06:09.118
we'll have more Albuquerque
traffic on the hour.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.289
Hey, um, you wanna hear
something funny?

06:15.125 --> 06:17.960
We had a... A faculty
meeting last Thursday

06:18.128 --> 06:21.047
and the topic was
senior-class photos

06:21.214 --> 06:24.592
and how we had instituted
a new rule last year

06:24.760 --> 06:27.636
that seniors are allowed
to have photos taken

06:27.804 --> 06:30.056
by a photographer
of their choice.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.641
You know, not necessarily
the photographer

06:32.809 --> 06:33.934
that the school hires, right?
So...

06:35.771 --> 06:36.937
Um, eh,

06:37.105 --> 06:40.524
so anyway, uh,
some of the senior girls

06:40.692 --> 06:44.487
were going to that, um,
Glamour Shots place

06:44.654 --> 06:45.696
to have their photos taken.

06:45.864 --> 06:49.325
And now they're bringing us
all these photos,

06:49.493 --> 06:51.410
and Joan Everman...
You know Joan.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.662
Suddenly has to go through
all these photos

06:53.830 --> 06:57.750
and turn them down
because they show cleavage.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.838
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetie?

07:03.715 --> 07:05.674
Yeah. I... I'm good.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.051
Okay.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.178
You know,
even the small-busted girls

07:09.346 --> 07:10.346
have cleavage.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.766
Apparently there's some new type

07:13.934 --> 07:16.310
of brassiere or something.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.939
The Wonderbra.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.068
It's the Wonderbra.
Yeah?

07:25.529 --> 07:26.570
Okay.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.701
Hey, there.
You've reached Walt,

07:32.869 --> 07:34.537
Skyler and Walter Jr.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.039
We can't come to the phone right
now, so please leave us a message.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.834
Hello, Mr. White.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.669
This is AT&T calling.

07:41.837 --> 07:44.922
Are you happy with your current
long-distance service?

07:45.090 --> 07:48.217
Because if you're not, I would
definitely really, really love

07:48.385 --> 07:50.427
to talk to you
as soon as possible about...

07:50.595 --> 07:52.638
Hello? Hello? Hello, this
is Walter White speaking.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.890
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

07:55.058 --> 07:56.684
You said he would die
any minute.

07:56.852 --> 07:59.061
Listen, uh,
I am having breakfast

07:59.229 --> 08:00.437
with my family right now

08:00.605 --> 08:03.315
and I... I really don't
appreciate these sales calls.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.901
Well, too bad, man,
because guess what.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.820
He's still not dead.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.531
I went and put my ear to
the RV. I can hear him, like,

08:10.699 --> 08:12.408
rolling around in there,
all right?

08:12.576 --> 08:14.034
I... I... I think he's awake, man.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.828
I think he's trying
to get loose.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.913
Where the hell are you?
I'm freaking out over here.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.415
Calm down, damn it.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.083
Are you gonna help me
clean this up?

08:21.251 --> 08:22.918
Huh? We got loose ends here.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.420
Calm down.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.213
I will be there after school.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.424
Huh, after school.
Are you shitting me?

08:28.592 --> 08:30.593
Ditch it, man. Call in sick.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.470
Listen, uh, that is just
not gonna work for me.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.347
I'm... I'm not interested
in that at all.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.851
And, uh, I would appreciate it
if you don't call here anymore.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.854
Damn. They're so annoying, those people.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.943
You have a good day, sweetie.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.278
Okay, Mom. You too.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.655
Okay.
Bye, honey.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.120
Drive safe.
Okay.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.800
Yo, yo, yo,

09:11.968 --> 09:14.595
1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9,

09:14.763 --> 09:16.222
representing the ABQ.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.724
What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.

09:34.991 --> 09:38.869
So the term "chiral"

09:39.037 --> 09:42.414
derives from the Greek word
"hand."

09:42.582 --> 09:45.084
Now, the concept here
being that

09:45.252 --> 09:48.754
just as your left hand
and your right hand

09:48.922 --> 09:51.507
are mirror images
of one another, right,

09:51.675 --> 09:53.175
identical and yet opposite,

09:53.343 --> 09:56.262
well, so, too,
organic compounds can exist

09:56.429 --> 10:00.224
as mirror-image forms
of one another

10:00.392 --> 10:02.434
all the way down
at the molecular level.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.188
But although they may
look the same,

10:07.524 --> 10:09.775
they don't always
behave the same.

10:09.943 --> 10:16.657
For instance...

10:17.993 --> 10:20.869
Uh, I'm sorry.
Uh, for instance, uh...

10:21.037 --> 10:22.621
Thalidomide.

10:22.789 --> 10:27.543
The... The right-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide

10:27.711 --> 10:29.670
is a perfectly fine,
good medicine

10:29.838 --> 10:32.756
to give to a pregnant woman
to prevent morning sickness.

10:32.924 --> 10:36.677
But make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman

10:36.845 --> 10:41.223
the left-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide

10:41.391 --> 10:46.103
and her child will be born
with horrible birth defects.

10:48.106 --> 10:51.608
Which is precisely
what happened in the 1950s.

10:51.776 --> 10:55.279
So chiral, chirality,

10:55.447 --> 10:57.990
mirrored images, right?

10:58.158 --> 11:01.744
Active, inactive, good, bad.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.374
Uh, so.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.584
Yes, Ben.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.544
Is this gonna be
on the murder?

11:13.340 --> 11:14.381
What?

11:14.549 --> 11:17.134
Is this gonna be
on the midterm?

11:18.762 --> 11:20.888
Uh, chirality on the midterm?

11:22.265 --> 11:24.725
No, no. Well, maybe.
Maybe. Yes, you know...

11:24.893 --> 11:27.561
But prepare for it
to be on the midterm.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.980
Can't hurt to know it, right?
So...

11:30.148 --> 11:32.149
Knowledge is power.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.811
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.195
Not good.
Not good, not good.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.423
What the...?

13:40.403 --> 13:43.614
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.574
Hey, listen, you.

13:45.742 --> 13:46.867
No, no, no, no!

13:51.623 --> 13:53.165
Oh, God.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.295
Okay.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.606
MILFs?

14:59.774 --> 15:01.650
The hell is a MILF?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.338
Now what?

15:26.968 --> 15:28.927
Lock the other one
out in the RV.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.846
He's, uh:

15:31.014 --> 15:32.514
You're sure?
Yes.

15:32.682 --> 15:33.890
You're positive?
Hey, you know what?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.183
Feel free to go
check it yourself.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.019
Hey, yeah, Good idea.
Maybe I should do that

15:37.186 --> 15:39.146
before he, too, wanders off
down the damn street.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.522
Okay, you know what?
I am sick...

15:40.690 --> 15:41.773
Just... All right.
All right!

15:41.941 --> 15:43.358
Just...

15:43.526 --> 15:46.695
The one downstairs,
tell me about him.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.196
Oh, come on. Anything.
Something.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.032
Start with his name,
at least.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.533
Krazy-8.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.244
Krazy-8. What the hell
does that even mean?

15:54.412 --> 15:55.871
I don't know, man, okay?

15:56.039 --> 15:59.041
It means, like... Like,
Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.210
So you work with him regularly.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.379
No, not him so much.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.215
His cousin, mainly.
Who's his cousin?

16:07.383 --> 16:08.967
The... The guy out in the RV.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.385
All right, all right,
all right.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.055
Krazy-8's one level higher.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.723
One level higher.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.560
Yeah, you know.
Not, like, street level. Higher.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.563
You know how there's, like,
a Starbucks on every corner?

16:21.731 --> 16:25.400
Krazy-8 is like the dude
that sells Starbucks' beans.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.361
Okay, so he's a distributor.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.824
Okay, so is he?
I mean, is?

16:32.992 --> 16:38.080
In other words, what is his
reputation for violence?

16:38.247 --> 16:40.916
Well, um, he did try

16:41.084 --> 16:43.085
to kill us both yesterday,
so there's that.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.628
Look, what I'm trying to say

16:44.796 --> 16:46.546
is that he's a distributor,
right?

16:46.714 --> 16:50.092
He's a... He's a businessman.
He's a man of business.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.094
It would therefore
seem to follow that he is

16:52.261 --> 16:56.556
capable of acting out of
mutual self-interest, yes?

16:56.724 --> 16:58.266
What?

16:58.434 --> 17:03.271
Do you think he is capable
of listening to reason?

17:04.107 --> 17:06.149
I mean, what...? What kind
of reason? You mean, like,

17:06.317 --> 17:08.151
"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen,
if I let you go,

17:08.319 --> 17:10.779
you promise not to come back
and waste my entire family?

17:10.947 --> 17:13.448
No Colombian neckties?"
You mean that kind of reason?

17:13.616 --> 17:15.575
No, man, I can't say as I have
high fucking hopes

17:15.743 --> 17:16.785
where that's concerned.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.919
What was that?

17:26.087 --> 17:27.629
What was what?
Shh!

17:32.510 --> 17:33.593
Come!
What?

17:35.138 --> 17:36.513
We didn't tie him up.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.973
Why the hell
didn't we tie him up?

17:38.141 --> 17:39.558
Oh, God.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.143
Because he was out cold.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.437
Yeah, but what...
What if he's faking it?

17:43.604 --> 17:44.730
You know, like,
if it was me,

17:44.897 --> 17:47.983
I'd be all faking
being knocked out, yo.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.152
And then,
when the coast is clear,

17:50.319 --> 17:52.571
I'd be up looking
for weapons and shit.

17:52.739 --> 17:53.905
Ready to pounce.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.962
Shh, shh, shh.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.348
No, see. Now, if it was me

18:20.516 --> 18:22.225
and I couldn't find
a decent enough weapon,

18:22.393 --> 18:26.271
I would just lie back down
and bide my time.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.536
So now what do we do?

19:26.749 --> 19:29.417
You keep asking me that

19:29.585 --> 19:32.879
like you think I have
some answer.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.590
Well, you gotta
do something.

19:35.758 --> 19:36.883
No, we.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.970
We have got to do something,
and I am open to suggestions.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.639
Man, uh, okay,
this whole thing was your deal.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.933
Don't you dare put that on me.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.601
You brought those guys
out there.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.103
This is your responsibility.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.689
Oh, like I came to you,
begging to cook meth.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.774
"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude
I know,

19:52.942 --> 19:55.277
you wanna come cook crystal?"
Please.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.112
I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny

19:57.280 --> 19:59.531
but her wheelchair
wouldn't fit in the RV.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.374
What about the, uh...
The... The... The phosphate gas?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.751
The phosphine gas.
What about it?

20:11.919 --> 20:14.880
Well, do... I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

20:15.047 --> 20:17.757
You know, with, like,
a delayed reaction or something?

20:20.303 --> 20:21.344
I... I don't know.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.971
You're supposed
to be a scientist.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.640
Look, this isn't even
the issue

20:25.808 --> 20:28.476
that demands
immediate attention.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.854
We have got a body in that RV.

20:31.022 --> 20:32.314
And it's getting warmer outside.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.648
Understand?

20:33.816 --> 20:37.068
And we have got to
do something about that soon.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.529
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

20:39.697 --> 20:44.492
Now, that... That last part
is very, very important.

20:44.660 --> 20:49.831
Therefore, it seems to me

20:49.999 --> 20:51.875
that our best course of action

20:52.043 --> 20:55.837
would be chemical
disincorporation.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.843
Dissolving in strong acid.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.644
Oh, man, that's messed up.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.606
I mean, ahem,
you're not serious.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.527
You serious?

21:26.369 --> 21:28.328
Well, who's gonna do that?

21:28.496 --> 21:30.538
And don't look at me.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.834
I guess we'll both do it
together.

21:35.002 --> 21:38.088
No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not...
I'm not good with dead bodies.

21:38.255 --> 21:43.051
Look, we are in this
fifty-fifty. Okay?

21:46.055 --> 21:51.643
I guess the only other fair way
to go about this would be

21:51.811 --> 21:56.856
that one of us deals with
the body situation

21:57.024 --> 22:02.404
while the other one of us deals
with the Krazy-8 situation.

22:10.413 --> 22:13.915
In a scenario like this,
I don't suppose it is bad form

22:14.083 --> 22:18.712
to just flip a coin.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.095
Heads or tails?

22:27.263 --> 22:29.931
No, I'll... I'll do the body
in the acid, okay?

22:30.099 --> 22:32.225
Heads or tails?

22:41.027 --> 22:43.445
Heads. Heads.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.465
Best two out of three?

23:20.900 --> 23:23.943
Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3

23:24.111 --> 23:26.821
to the 6 to the 9,
representing the ABQ.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.324
What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.

23:31.494 --> 23:34.329
Hey, Mr. White, it's me.
-Pick up.

23:34.497 --> 23:36.664
I got a container question.

23:38.209 --> 23:41.252
Hello, Mr. White.
Pick up the phone, man.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.755
Yes.
Yo, what kind of plastic, man?

23:43.923 --> 23:46.132
Polyethylene.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.344
Well, how the hell am I
supposed to know that?

23:49.512 --> 23:51.179
Because I told you.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.472
Look, just...

23:53.849 --> 23:57.977
Look at the bottom
for a triangle

23:58.145 --> 24:00.396
stamped LDPE.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.607
It should be molded
right into the plastic.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got it.

24:05.528 --> 24:09.864
I don't know, man.
This feels kind of flimsy.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.367
Any decent acid's
gonna eat right through this.

24:12.535 --> 24:15.203
Not hydrofluoric.
Why not?

24:17.456 --> 24:21.709
Look, you skipped,
clowned around

24:21.877 --> 24:25.630
or otherwise jerked off through
every lecture I ever gave.

24:25.798 --> 24:29.008
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.761
Oh, okay, be a dick about it.
Jesus.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.517
So, hey, have you, um?

24:37.685 --> 24:39.519
Have you done the...?
The thing?

24:43.941 --> 24:45.733
Yeah, I'm...

24:45.901 --> 24:47.735
I'm working up to it.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.240
You know what?

24:52.408 --> 24:54.367
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.329
You know, not even if you took
him to the hospital right now.

24:59.874 --> 25:00.957
Now, if it was me,

25:01.125 --> 25:04.586
I would just try and think of it
like I was...

25:04.753 --> 25:06.379
I was doing him a favor.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.365
I need a check approval
on checkstand eight.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.827
Approval on checkstand eight,
please. Thank you.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.636
Yeah.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.346
Who's there?

27:24.226 --> 27:26.311
What, you fucking break in?
Show me who's there.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.735
Yeah. I see you.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.197
What you gonna do?

27:39.783 --> 27:41.784
Hey.

27:41.952 --> 27:42.994
Hey...!

27:48.542 --> 27:49.584
Hey!

27:50.878 --> 27:51.919
I need water.

27:53.964 --> 27:57.008
Hey, hello.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.093
Bring me some water,
would you?

28:01.764 --> 28:03.181
Please.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.007
You don't like the crust?

29:31.562 --> 29:33.020
Where's my cousin Emilio?

29:38.068 --> 29:39.110
He dead?

30:03.635 --> 30:06.554
Oh, I'm a coward.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.726
Hey, Mr. White.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.437
Hey, Mr. White?

31:39.314 --> 31:40.565
Oh, fuck.

31:44.152 --> 31:48.114
Are you smoking weed?
Oh, my God.

31:48.282 --> 31:51.117
Wait a minute, is that...?
Is that my weed?

31:52.578 --> 31:54.537
What the hell, man?

31:54.705 --> 31:56.747
Make yourself at home,
why don't you?

32:00.377 --> 32:02.503
So, what'd you end up buying?

32:02.671 --> 32:04.255
Nothing.

32:05.674 --> 32:09.802
No store in town sells a plastic
bin big enough for a body.

32:11.096 --> 32:14.640
I don't suppose
you could buy two bins?

32:14.808 --> 32:17.351
And, uh, just:

32:19.062 --> 32:21.522
Legs in one,
torso in the other?

32:21.690 --> 32:23.733
Oh, God.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.695
I don't suppose
you could kiss my ass?

32:36.330 --> 32:37.705
So, uh,

32:39.541 --> 32:41.542
how'd it...? How'd it go?

32:48.759 --> 32:50.384
You didn't do it?

32:50.552 --> 32:52.178
Not... Not yet.

32:52.346 --> 32:55.348
Oh, God.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.894
Oh, damn. I gotta go.
Hey, hey.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.480
What? No, no, no.
Come back here.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.691
Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow,
I promise.

33:05.859 --> 33:06.901
Tomorrow?

33:07.069 --> 33:09.236
I've got a doctor's appointment.
I gotta go.

33:09.404 --> 33:12.865
Look, stay away from him.
He's awake.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.244
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.708
We flipped a coin!

33:27.756 --> 33:30.174
We're... We're good?

33:30.342 --> 33:33.928
We're very good.
We're excellent, I'd say.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.806
Oh.

33:36.973 --> 33:40.434
Oh, would you look
at that face?

33:41.770 --> 33:43.437
Smile, peanut.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.859
So who's up for knowing?

33:50.320 --> 33:51.362
Oh...
Uh...

33:53.115 --> 33:54.615
It's... It's...
Uh...

33:56.451 --> 33:57.493
Yeah.

33:57.661 --> 33:58.786
Girl.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.538
Girl?

34:00.706 --> 34:02.623
You sure?
-Pretty sure.

34:04.126 --> 34:05.543
Wow.

34:07.796 --> 34:10.756
Oh, God. Can I tell you,
that's exactly what I was hoping.

34:10.924 --> 34:12.591
Yeah?
Yeah.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.720
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.764
Looking fabulous.

34:18.932 --> 34:20.808
Let me see if they're done
with the blood sugar,

34:20.976 --> 34:24.437
then we'll get you out of here.
I'll be right back.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.424
Who's Jesse Pinkman?

35:00.348 --> 35:01.348
Jesse?

35:01.516 --> 35:04.351
Jesse Pinkman.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.564
He... He called
just this morning.

35:08.732 --> 35:09.774
Walt, please don't deny it.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.233
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:11.401 --> 35:15.362
It... It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.198
What, was he one
of your students?

35:17.365 --> 35:18.407
Yeah.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.285
He was nobody.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.707
Who...? Who is he to you?
Why...? Why is he calling?

35:26.875 --> 35:28.083
What is this big secret

35:28.251 --> 35:32.046
you seem to be discussing
with some druggie burnout?

35:35.425 --> 35:39.345
You don't come home last night
until 2 in the morning.

35:39.513 --> 35:40.888
You don't tell me
where you've been.

35:41.056 --> 35:45.017
You spent the entire night
in the bathroom, Walt.

35:45.185 --> 35:48.562
Tell me what's going on
with you.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.190
Don't you think
you owe me that?

35:54.444 --> 35:57.822
Who is this Jesse Pinkman
to you?

36:01.993 --> 36:04.578
He sells me pot.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.875
He sells you pot?

36:10.043 --> 36:11.919
Marijuana, yeah.

36:12.087 --> 36:16.173
Not a lot.
I mean, I don't know.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.344
I kind of like it.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.472
Are you out of your mind?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.432
What...? What are you, like,
16 years old?

36:25.600 --> 36:28.102
Your brother-in-law
is a DEA agent.

36:28.270 --> 36:30.771
What...?
What is wrong with you?

36:30.939 --> 36:33.983
Look, Skyler,

36:38.488 --> 36:42.908
I just haven't
quite been myself lately.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.661
Yeah. No shit.
Thanks for noticing.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.080
I haven't been myself lately,

36:48.248 --> 36:50.207
but I love you.

36:50.375 --> 36:53.794
Nothing about that
has changed.

36:53.962 --> 36:56.171
Nothing ever will.

36:56.339 --> 36:59.508
So right now, what I need

36:59.676 --> 37:03.846
is for you to climb down
out of my ass.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.059
Can you do that?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.020
Will you do that for me, honey?

37:11.187 --> 37:14.857
Will you please, just once,

37:15.025 --> 37:16.525
get off my ass?

37:16.693 --> 37:18.569
You know.

37:18.737 --> 37:23.240
I'd appreciate it.
I really would.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.721
Stop.

37:56.691 --> 37:59.485
Stop in... In 15 minutes.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.555
Your face is too sharp.

38:33.895 --> 38:36.188
Powder. Powder!

38:36.356 --> 38:38.065
Take a powder, go on.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.321
Nice. Beautiful talcum powder.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.657
Lucky you, number eight.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.663
Just meat, it's all just...
Just a bunch of meat.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.130
Oh, Jesus.

39:05.635 --> 39:07.344
You're cool,
you're cool.

39:07.512 --> 39:11.890
You're all good, you're all...
You're all good. You know it.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.143
It's fine.
It's just a bunch of meat.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.478
Come on. You're good.

39:39.127 --> 39:40.753
Excuse me.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.965
Excuse me. You. Yes, you.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.092
May I talk to you?

39:49.971 --> 39:51.388
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, hey, hey.

39:51.556 --> 39:52.639
This is private property.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.475
Just a minute.
I... I wanna talk to you.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.144
No, no, not interested. Come on.
-Hey, don't touch me.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.897
Do not touch me.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.483
All right, all right, look, not
touching, okay? Not touching here.

40:02.650 --> 40:05.319
Look, lady, whatever you're
selling, I ain't buying, yo.

40:05.487 --> 40:08.238
Well, my name
is Skyler White, yo.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.532
My husband
is Walter White, yo.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.285
Uh-huh.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.995
He told me everything.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.747
Seriously?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.290
That's right.

40:18.458 --> 40:21.210
And just so you know,

40:21.377 --> 40:24.838
my brother-in-law
is a DEA agent

40:25.006 --> 40:27.341
and I will not hesitate
to call him.

40:27.509 --> 40:30.928
Not if I have to.
Understood?

40:31.679 --> 40:35.099
This is your one
and only warning.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.478
Do not sell marijuana
to my husband.

40:41.481 --> 40:43.315
Okay.
I mean it.

40:43.483 --> 40:45.526
Don't call our house again.

40:45.693 --> 40:49.404
You stay away from him, or
you will be one sorry individual.

40:51.324 --> 40:52.366
You get me?

40:52.534 --> 40:55.285
I... I, uh, think so, yeah.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.871
Um, no more marijuana.
Mm-hm.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.665
I can... I can dig it.

40:59.833 --> 41:03.335
You can dig it. Wonderful.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.055
Not that it's any
of my business,

41:15.223 --> 41:19.226
but you might wanna consider
a different line of work.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.436
Okay.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.242
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:17.410 --> 42:19.119
Let's go to your house,
you know.

42:19.287 --> 42:20.996
Makes perfect sense.

42:21.164 --> 42:22.206
Let's, uh...

42:23.583 --> 42:26.501
Let's completely screw up
your house

42:26.669 --> 42:28.795
so you never wanna spend
another night in it.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.423
Sure. You know, why not?

42:36.304 --> 42:39.806
Yeah, and how's about I send
over my psycho-bitch wife

42:39.974 --> 42:42.643
to, uh, you know, break your
balls and threaten you?

42:42.810 --> 42:44.895
God, that would be hilarious,
you know.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.397
And then, you know,
the killer in the basement,

42:47.565 --> 42:50.692
the one who's completely
my responsibility,

42:50.860 --> 42:54.154
hell, let's just
let him live down there.

42:54.322 --> 42:57.616
Just, I don't know, make sure
to feed him, like,

42:57.784 --> 42:59.952
three times a day.

43:01.704 --> 43:04.414
Sure, why not?
It's been really amazing.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.083
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

43:06.251 --> 43:10.003
I always dreamt about,
I don't know, melting bodies.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.738
You got a brother
in the goddamn DEA?

43:40.410 --> 43:41.451
What?

43:41.619 --> 43:43.370
You said you were just doing
some ride-along.

43:43.538 --> 43:46.498
Yes or no, do you have a brother
in the DEA?

43:47.792 --> 43:48.834
He's a brother-in-law.

43:49.002 --> 43:51.837
Oh, well, there's a load
off my mind.

43:52.005 --> 43:53.213
Where did you hear that?

43:53.381 --> 43:55.048
Your freaking wife told me

43:55.216 --> 43:57.301
when she was here
all up in my shit.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.844
Yeah, that's right.

43:59.012 --> 44:01.388
She almost caught me
moving Emilio.

44:01.556 --> 44:04.683
Good job on wearing
the pants in the family.

44:04.851 --> 44:07.894
And why'd you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

44:09.564 --> 44:11.982
Because somehow
it seemed preferable

44:12.150 --> 44:16.069
to admitting that I cook
crystal meth and killed a man.

44:25.246 --> 44:26.580
Is that what I think it is?

44:26.748 --> 44:28.123
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
I smoked a bowl.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.500
So what?
My house, my rules.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.919
Hey, no, no.
Hey, don't give me that, okay?

44:33.087 --> 44:34.504
I held up my end.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.131
I already took care
of Emilio.

44:36.299 --> 44:38.508
You're still diddling around
trying to get your nut up.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.427
Yeah, well, boo-hoo.

44:40.595 --> 44:42.387
I have the truly awful job here.

44:42.555 --> 44:44.806
Oh, you wanna... You wanna talk
awful? You wanna go there?

44:44.974 --> 44:49.144
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink
up a flight of stairs.

44:49.312 --> 44:51.521
I barely got him in the bathtub.

44:51.689 --> 44:55.233
Bathtub, what?
What do you mean, bathtub?

44:55.401 --> 44:56.443
You know,
and that's another thing.

44:56.611 --> 44:57.986
Why you got me
running around town

44:58.154 --> 45:00.489
trying to find
some stupid piece of plastic

45:00.656 --> 45:02.949
when I have a perfectly good tub
I can use?

45:06.621 --> 45:09.164
Oh, God.

45:09.874 --> 45:11.708
Hey. Hey.

46:06.514 --> 46:10.058
I'm sorry, what were you
asking me? Oh, yes.

46:10.226 --> 46:14.521
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

46:14.689 --> 46:18.316
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

46:18.484 --> 46:24.823
It will, however, dissolve
metal, rock, glass, ceramic.

46:25.199 --> 46:27.117
So there's that.

47:00.443 --> 47:02.068
Here I go.
