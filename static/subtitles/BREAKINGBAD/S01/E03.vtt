00:45.000 --> 00:46.502
<i>Let's break it down.</i>

00:48.671 --> 00:50.964
Hydrogen. What does that give us?

00:51.173 --> 00:53.967
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.

00:54.176 --> 00:56.261
Sixty-three?

00:56.470 --> 00:57.888
That is a big bite.

00:58.097 --> 01:01.225
- My next step's gotta be oxygen.
- Oxygen, 26 percent.

01:01.433 --> 01:03.602
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.

01:03.811 --> 01:07.189
- Carbon, 9 percent.
- Carbon, 9.

01:07.398 --> 01:10.317
- For a total of 98 percent.
- Right.

01:10.526 --> 01:14.780
- Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.
- One-point-two-five.

01:14.988 --> 01:17.282
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.

01:17.491 --> 01:20.452
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements...

01:20.661 --> 01:23.205
...down where the magic happens.

01:23.414 --> 01:27.167
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.

01:27.376 --> 01:29.169
Got a whole skeleton to account for.

01:29.378 --> 01:31.046
- You would think, right?
- Right.

01:31.255 --> 01:34.800
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.

01:35.300 --> 01:39.722
What? That low? Seriously?

01:39.930 --> 01:41.640
Damn, I never would've thought that.

01:41.849 --> 01:46.645
- Okay, so where does iron fit in?
- Iron.

01:46.854 --> 01:53.694
Well, okay, 0.00004 percent.

01:54.028 --> 01:57.781
What? You can't have
hemoglobin without iron.

01:57.990 --> 02:00.826
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No doubt. Go figure.

02:01.035 --> 02:04.872
- Sodium.
- Sodium, 0.04.

02:06.874 --> 02:11.795
- Phosphorus, 0.19.
- Point-one-nine.

02:12.504 --> 02:13.922
There we go.

02:14.423 --> 02:17.926
So the whole thing...

02:18.135 --> 02:24.558
...adds up to 99.888042 percent.

02:27.269 --> 02:32.608
We are 0.111958 percent...

02:33.650 --> 02:34.943
...shy.

02:35.152 --> 02:38.781
- Supposedly, that's everything.
- Yeah?

02:40.574 --> 02:41.950
I don't know, I just...

02:43.577 --> 02:45.704
It seems like something's missing,
doesn't it?

02:48.248 --> 02:51.960
There's got to be more
to a human being than that.

03:23.409 --> 03:25.035
I hate these shoes.

03:25.244 --> 03:27.955
Shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans...

03:28.163 --> 03:29.999
...like I should be squeaking around...

03:30.207 --> 03:32.793
...bringing soup to some
disgusting old person...

03:33.002 --> 03:34.962
...then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

03:35.170 --> 03:37.381
Then why are you wearing them?

03:38.507 --> 03:41.885
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely archy.

03:45.055 --> 03:50.686
Yo, what's up? Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes? Thanks, bye.

03:52.563 --> 03:54.773
I gotta go take this.

03:55.774 --> 03:57.484
Female?

03:58.861 --> 04:00.738
Louis.

04:00.946 --> 04:04.408
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

04:04.616 --> 04:06.577
- Just be quick about it.
- No.

04:06.785 --> 04:11.165
Oh, and please don't say, "Yo."

04:11.373 --> 04:14.126
You can't know how much I hate that.

04:19.298 --> 04:22.926
You missed a spot, right there.

04:23.427 --> 04:24.803
Should you be on that ladder?

04:25.012 --> 04:27.473
You're more than welcome
to take over for me in here.

04:27.681 --> 04:29.892
I don't see why you don't get
Walt to do it.

04:30.351 --> 04:33.312
Yeah, there's an idea.

04:35.397 --> 04:38.317
So I'm working on
this new short story...

04:38.525 --> 04:43.113
...and there's this stoner character in it
and I'm trying to...

04:44.406 --> 04:46.533
Well, you know, actually,
let me back up.

04:46.742 --> 04:52.289
You smoked your fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

04:54.166 --> 04:57.044
I mean, you at least tried it.

04:59.088 --> 05:00.964
Come on.

05:02.925 --> 05:06.970
I perhaps tried it. Why?

05:07.179 --> 05:09.473
Do you remember it
having an effect on your mood?

05:09.682 --> 05:11.767
Like, changing it in any major way?

05:12.393 --> 05:14.603
It made me more serious.

05:14.812 --> 05:16.480
Really?

05:16.689 --> 05:21.985
Because I mostly remember it made me
light-headed, that's about it.

05:22.778 --> 05:26.949
I was just wondering
if it maybe could...

05:29.868 --> 05:34.289
You know, it's just a character thing
I'm stuck on. Never mind.

05:34.498 --> 05:37.584
- Walter Jr.'s on pot?
- What? No.

05:37.793 --> 05:39.461
No. No.

05:39.670 --> 05:42.214
- What would make you even...?
- Where's he getting it?

05:42.423 --> 05:45.884
- Marie.
- Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

05:46.301 --> 05:50.431
- What are you gonna do about this?
- Marie, you need to look me in the eye.

05:50.639 --> 05:54.518
I am strictly asking about a story
that I'm writing, that's all.

05:55.144 --> 05:59.273
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. Is not on pot...

05:59.481 --> 06:02.317
...certainly not as far as I know.

06:03.027 --> 06:04.987
Not as far as you know?

06:05.487 --> 06:07.072
Marie.

07:54.221 --> 07:56.098
Hey, look at me.

07:57.766 --> 07:59.893
Hey, turn around and look at me.

08:04.606 --> 08:08.318
This here.

08:08.944 --> 08:11.488
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

08:13.615 --> 08:15.451
This is degrading.

08:20.205 --> 08:21.874
I'm sorry.

08:22.791 --> 08:25.919
You hope I'll make it easy
and just drop dead, don't you?

08:27.463 --> 08:29.214
But I won't.

08:29.423 --> 08:31.842
So either kill me, or let me go.

08:33.177 --> 08:35.637
You don't have it in you, Walter.

08:39.683 --> 08:41.435
How do you know my name?

08:42.895 --> 08:47.024
Jesse. He told Emilio and me.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.319
I came by to sell your meth.

08:51.737 --> 08:54.990
So what? You threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?

08:55.199 --> 08:57.201
Not even close.

09:00.913 --> 09:02.956
What else did he tell you?

09:04.458 --> 09:07.086
Pretty much everything
he could think of.

09:07.294 --> 09:09.546
You were his high school teacher.

09:09.755 --> 09:11.757
One time you taught
about carbon dioxide...

09:11.965 --> 09:14.510
...by making grape soda in class.

09:15.260 --> 09:18.972
You have a son who's retarded,
or in a wheelchair or something.

09:21.475 --> 09:24.436
It shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

09:24.645 --> 09:26.814
That partner of yours...

09:27.022 --> 09:28.148
...he's got a big mouth.

09:30.025 --> 09:31.694
Walter...

09:31.902 --> 09:34.363
...I don't know what you think
you're doing here...

09:34.571 --> 09:36.240
...but trust me...

09:37.032 --> 09:39.576
...this line of work doesn't suit you.

09:41.495 --> 09:44.915
So I should just let you go, then.

09:45.124 --> 09:49.628
Just unlock you and... adiÃ³s, huh?

09:50.129 --> 09:52.589
I don't see
what other choice you have.

09:52.798 --> 09:55.634
It's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

09:56.427 --> 09:57.886
Besides...

09:59.096 --> 10:01.056
...your real problem's
sitting upstairs.

10:20.701 --> 10:22.119
Occupied.

10:22.745 --> 10:25.331
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off
in here.

10:25.539 --> 10:27.583
Just give me some privacy,
would you?

10:30.919 --> 10:33.505
- Okay.
- What the hell, man?

10:34.590 --> 10:36.383
What are you doing, man?

10:36.592 --> 10:38.844
- You asshole. What...?
- You told him my name.

10:39.053 --> 10:41.138
- Says who, him?
- My name, where I work.

10:41.347 --> 10:43.724
- You told him about my son.
- Hey, don't touch me.

10:43.932 --> 10:46.518
- You damn junkie.
- No, give me that. That's mine.

10:46.727 --> 10:48.854
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.

10:49.063 --> 10:50.564
No, that's worth 40 grand, you...

10:50.773 --> 10:53.484
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

10:53.692 --> 10:55.652
Get off the toilet.

10:55.861 --> 10:57.654
- Get off the toilet!
- No.

10:59.740 --> 11:02.785
Get off the toilet.

11:03.118 --> 11:05.245
Stop it.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.000
No. No way.

11:44.535 --> 11:45.786
No.

11:45.995 --> 11:47.955
No, no, no.

11:48.163 --> 11:50.708
Jesse, where the hell do you think
you're going?

11:50.916 --> 11:52.251
Back off, man, Jesus.

11:52.459 --> 11:53.919
- We've got work to do.
- No, no.

11:54.128 --> 11:56.630
You got work to do. I did my part.

11:56.839 --> 11:59.299
You mean that obscenity
I spent hours cleaning up?

11:59.508 --> 12:02.386
- That is your contribution?
- Kiss my pink ass, man.

12:02.594 --> 12:05.889
I didn't ask for any of this. How am I
supposed to live here now, huh?

12:06.098 --> 12:08.684
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

12:08.892 --> 12:11.979
Because you didn't follow
my instructions.

12:12.187 --> 12:13.897
Oh, well, <i>Heil Hitler</i>, bitch.

12:14.106 --> 12:16.358
And let me tell you something else.

12:16.567 --> 12:19.361
We flipped a coin, okay?

12:19.570 --> 12:22.114
You and me. You and me.

12:22.322 --> 12:24.616
Coin flip is sacred.

12:35.127 --> 12:37.421
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement...

12:37.629 --> 12:39.840
...as per the coin.

12:40.049 --> 12:41.550
Fucking do it, already.

12:56.523 --> 12:59.485
That's what she said. Yeah.

13:00.527 --> 13:02.863
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we have some of those.

13:03.572 --> 13:05.532
- Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
- Hello?

13:05.741 --> 13:08.202
- Seven and a half, maybe. I don't know.
- Excuse me.

13:08.410 --> 13:09.828
Do you have these in black?

13:12.247 --> 13:13.999
Anyways, so like I was saying...

13:14.208 --> 13:17.544
...I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.

13:21.382 --> 13:22.675
Whatever.

13:22.883 --> 13:25.511
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

13:25.719 --> 13:28.180
<i>Sorry, baby, I'm kind of busy here.
What's up?</i>

13:28.389 --> 13:32.601
Well, kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject.

13:32.810 --> 13:37.648
- So I need you to focus, and...
<i>- Hey, sit down! Sit down!</i>

13:37.856 --> 13:39.942
Damn it, Hank.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.903
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle
of something here.

13:43.112 --> 13:44.947
Get down. Get down.

13:45.155 --> 13:48.867
Sit down! Sit your ass down,
<i>comprende?</i> You too, sit down!

13:54.206 --> 13:56.333
I'm back, babe. What's up?

13:56.542 --> 13:59.878
- Walter Jr.
<i>- Yeah, what about him?</i>

14:00.421 --> 14:03.674
Marijuana. He's smoking it.

14:03.882 --> 14:06.051
<i>Excuse me, his own mother
seems to think so.</i>

14:06.260 --> 14:08.178
- Skyler told you that?
<i>- She inferred it.</i>

14:08.387 --> 14:09.680
She inferred it, huh?

14:10.681 --> 14:12.683
She strongly inferred it.

14:12.891 --> 14:18.439
Like, " Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction."

14:18.647 --> 14:20.190
<i>- Please, come on.</i>
- All right.

14:20.399 --> 14:22.526
- Talk to him.
<i>- Walt should talk to him.</i>

14:22.735 --> 14:24.695
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.

14:24.903 --> 14:26.989
<i>I think it ought to be you.</i>

14:27.197 --> 14:29.199
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

14:29.408 --> 14:32.119
Maybe show him
some autopsy pictures.

14:32.328 --> 14:34.163
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.

14:34.496 --> 14:36.707
I don't know, baby,
it's just that, you know...

14:36.915 --> 14:40.085
...I figure his dad should be the one
doing this, don't you think?

14:40.294 --> 14:42.546
Hank, he respects you.

14:45.966 --> 14:49.803
Yeah, all right. Well, listen, yeah,
I'll swing by their place after work.

14:50.012 --> 14:52.723
- Good. Scare him straight.
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

14:52.931 --> 14:54.516
Hey, where's my sugar?

14:59.855 --> 15:00.981
Excuse me, ma'am.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.401
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

15:04.943 --> 15:06.528
I'm extremely clean.

15:06.737 --> 15:09.740
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.

15:11.241 --> 15:14.703
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

15:15.663 --> 15:18.123
You know, I hid a pair for you
last week, gray ones.

16:09.133 --> 16:12.302
- What do you think?
- About what?

16:13.512 --> 16:14.805
This look like a nice place?

16:15.681 --> 16:17.808
No, not really.

16:18.017 --> 16:20.019
Think you'd like to live here?

16:20.519 --> 16:22.021
No.

16:22.229 --> 16:25.107
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

16:25.315 --> 16:28.402
I thought we were going to
Cold Stone Creamery.

16:28.610 --> 16:31.155
Yeah, yeah, well,
we took a little detour.

16:31.363 --> 16:34.408
Figure we'll come over
and check out how the other half lives.

16:34.616 --> 16:37.119
This here is what we call
the Crystal Palace.

16:37.328 --> 16:40.080
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

16:40.831 --> 16:43.083
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads...

16:43.292 --> 16:47.254
...who'd sell their grandma's coochie
for a hit.

16:47.463 --> 16:49.923
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

16:50.132 --> 16:52.426
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these...

16:52.634 --> 16:56.930
...miserable wastes of skin
got started how?

16:57.139 --> 16:59.350
- How do you think they started?
- I don't know.

16:59.558 --> 17:02.353
What do you think they were doing
before they graduated...

17:02.561 --> 17:05.230
...to shooting meth in their dicks?

17:06.899 --> 17:08.692
A gateway drug.

17:08.901 --> 17:10.611
That's what we call it.

17:10.819 --> 17:13.155
Dollars to doughnuts,
and I shit you not...

17:13.364 --> 17:17.242
...that gateway drug was marijuana,
every time.

17:17.451 --> 17:19.453
- You understand?
- Yeah.

17:19.662 --> 17:22.706
So why are you telling me this?

17:22.915 --> 17:25.542
Because I love you,
you little bastard.

17:26.168 --> 17:28.837
And, hey, I was young once,
you know.

17:29.797 --> 17:32.633
The world's a messed up place,
you know.

17:32.841 --> 17:36.178
You know, just this one time,
you know...

17:36.387 --> 17:39.390
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

17:39.598 --> 17:43.477
Yeah, you, princess. Get over here.

17:45.979 --> 17:48.691
Hey, don't make me
get out of the car.

17:53.112 --> 17:54.405
Check this out.

17:54.613 --> 17:56.657
What I'm talking about.

17:57.741 --> 18:00.160
- I ain't holding, okay?
- Did I say open your mouth?

18:00.369 --> 18:02.246
And hands off the car.

18:02.997 --> 18:06.333
Other side. Go around the other side,
talk to my friend here.

18:09.253 --> 18:11.380
What's your name, sweetheart?

18:12.673 --> 18:14.383
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?

18:14.591 --> 18:16.719
How much you charge
for a windy, Wendy?

18:17.219 --> 18:20.139
- I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?

18:20.347 --> 18:23.100
Don't think so hard,
it's gonna hurt your brain.

18:23.308 --> 18:26.186
- Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
- Nothing. Neither.

18:26.395 --> 18:28.564
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?

18:28.772 --> 18:31.650
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

18:33.444 --> 18:37.323
Oh, God. See that? Pipe, definitely.

18:37.531 --> 18:39.158
Big time, big time on the pipe.

18:39.366 --> 18:41.452
You got something
you wanna ask Wendy?

18:41.660 --> 18:43.245
No, not really.

18:43.454 --> 18:45.581
You ever smoke anything else,
Wendy?

18:46.081 --> 18:48.334
Sausages don't count.

18:49.752 --> 18:52.921
Seriously, tell my friend here
how you got started.

18:53.130 --> 18:56.925
Probably used to be, what? Like a
Girl Scout, or sang in the church choir.

18:57.134 --> 19:01.180
- What are you, like, handicapped?
- He broke his leg playing football.

19:01.388 --> 19:05.059
He's a qb. Got an arm like a howitzer.

19:06.518 --> 19:09.271
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?

19:09.480 --> 19:10.606
Why, you got some?

19:10.814 --> 19:13.442
No. Right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.

19:13.650 --> 19:16.904
Hey, fair warning, next time
I'm gonna bust you.

19:24.411 --> 19:25.704
So, what do you think?

19:27.956 --> 19:28.957
Cool.

19:38.384 --> 19:41.929
Shut the door. Shut the door.
Lock it. Lock it, lock it.

19:42.930 --> 19:43.972
Who the hell was that?

19:44.181 --> 19:46.934
Cop and some football player
messing with me.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.395
They ask about me, huh?

19:50.312 --> 19:52.106
No, I think they just wanted pot.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.705
Right there.

20:09.123 --> 20:11.417
Shit, I left my root beer.

21:00.632 --> 21:03.677
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.

21:03.886 --> 21:05.679
Listen, I'm so sorry.

21:05.888 --> 21:11.101
Time, it just completely got away
from me. I'm just...

21:12.311 --> 21:16.065
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late...

21:16.273 --> 21:18.859
...you know, doing some inventory...

21:19.068 --> 21:21.654
...and I should've just...

21:21.862 --> 21:26.992
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, "No."

21:27.201 --> 21:29.203
But...

21:30.579 --> 21:32.998
Sky? You there?

21:34.416 --> 21:36.502
<i>You're at the car wash?</i>

21:37.461 --> 21:39.088
Yeah.

21:39.880 --> 21:44.885
I seriously doubt that,
since you quit two weeks ago.

21:50.557 --> 21:54.395
I called Bogdan, looking for you.

21:54.937 --> 21:57.022
Quite an earful he gave me.

21:59.149 --> 22:00.901
Listen...

22:02.569 --> 22:04.780
Listen, I'll come home
and we'll talk about it.

22:06.323 --> 22:08.784
- I don't think so, Walt.
<i>- Honey...</i>

22:08.993 --> 22:10.995
Wherever you are...

22:12.079 --> 22:14.873
...why don't you just
stay there tonight?

22:19.545 --> 22:20.963
Skyler?

22:22.756 --> 22:24.758
<i>Walter?</i>

22:25.134 --> 22:26.593
Hello?

22:26.802 --> 22:29.596
Hey, there's a hungry guy here.

24:07.861 --> 24:09.863
Come on.

24:32.302 --> 24:33.929
Damn.

24:34.430 --> 24:36.807
I didn't think you were coming back.

24:51.155 --> 24:52.740
How long was I out?

24:53.991 --> 24:55.659
Ten, 15 minutes?

24:57.661 --> 25:01.290
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

25:01.498 --> 25:03.542
Were you on the same shit
you used on me?

25:12.551 --> 25:13.927
I've got lung cancer.

25:38.744 --> 25:41.205
I'll make you another sandwich.

26:18.117 --> 26:19.910
It's safe.

26:20.911 --> 26:22.913
There's no poison.

26:26.083 --> 26:28.210
Because that would be
the way to do it...

26:28.961 --> 26:30.963
...if you're gonna do it.

26:32.256 --> 26:34.466
I suppose it would.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.846
You being a chemist and all.

26:56.030 --> 26:59.950
So that name...

27:00.367 --> 27:02.536
...Krazy-8.

27:02.828 --> 27:04.955
Do I really have to call you that?

27:05.164 --> 27:07.750
I mean, no offense, but...

27:08.292 --> 27:10.252
...don't you have a real name?

27:11.503 --> 27:13.255
Domingo.

27:14.340 --> 27:16.008
Domingo.

27:16.216 --> 27:18.969
That's "Sunday," right?

27:21.472 --> 27:25.309
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

27:28.020 --> 27:30.647
I can't say I ever liked it much.

27:33.776 --> 27:36.862
So, Domingo...

27:37.071 --> 27:40.908
...you from around town here
or someplace else?

27:41.241 --> 27:43.285
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me...

27:43.494 --> 27:46.538
...is not gonna make it easier
for you to kill me.

27:47.081 --> 27:48.832
Not that I mind, you understand?

27:51.418 --> 27:54.922
You know, you keep telling me
that I don't have it in me.

27:55.130 --> 27:56.799
Well, maybe.

27:57.299 --> 27:59.176
But maybe not.

28:02.346 --> 28:05.057
I sure as hell am looking for
any reason not to.

28:05.265 --> 28:08.686
I mean, any good reason at all.

28:14.858 --> 28:16.944
Sell me.

28:17.152 --> 28:19.196
Tell me what it is.

28:22.825 --> 28:25.244
I'd start off by promising
that if you let me go...

28:25.452 --> 28:28.789
...I won't come after you,
that you'd be safe.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.000
I guess I'd say
what happened between us...

28:32.126 --> 28:33.335
...never happened.

28:33.544 --> 28:37.214
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

28:37.965 --> 28:41.593
But you know anybody in my situation
would make promises like that.

28:41.802 --> 28:44.179
And, in my case,
they happen to be true.

28:44.388 --> 28:45.848
You'll never know for sure.

28:49.893 --> 28:52.062
So, what else can I tell you?

28:57.943 --> 28:59.820
I don't know.

29:01.196 --> 29:03.741
But you've gotta convince me.

29:04.616 --> 29:08.537
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

29:09.747 --> 29:12.082
- Hey, yeah.
- Yeah.

29:12.374 --> 29:14.543
I'm from here in town, man.

29:15.336 --> 29:17.880
ABQ, born and bred.

29:18.088 --> 29:20.007
Never left.

29:20.632 --> 29:23.886
Studied Business Administration
over at UNM...

29:24.094 --> 29:25.304
...got my degree.

29:26.555 --> 29:28.223
Really?

29:30.851 --> 29:34.396
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

29:34.605 --> 29:36.398
Doesn't hurt.

29:37.232 --> 29:39.985
I was gonna study music originally.

29:40.444 --> 29:43.197
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin and Berklee.

29:43.405 --> 29:46.659
My pops talked me out of it.

29:46.867 --> 29:50.746
Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star...

29:50.954 --> 29:53.916
...and I hadn't a snowball chance
at that one.

29:54.958 --> 29:57.127
What does your dad do?

29:58.170 --> 30:01.465
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.

30:02.549 --> 30:05.135
Wait a minute, I know that place.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.556
Wait a minute. That's...

30:09.765 --> 30:12.142
That's that...

30:12.351 --> 30:14.728
They used to have those late-night...

30:14.937 --> 30:17.189
- The stupid commercials.
- That they had, yeah.

30:17.398 --> 30:20.526
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.

30:20.734 --> 30:24.405
Wait a minute.
How did it go? It was...

30:24.738 --> 30:27.449
Wait, wait, wait. It was...

30:28.659 --> 30:33.205
<i>Don't let shopping
Strain your brain-o</i>

30:33.497 --> 30:37.126
<i>Just sing this short refrain-o</i>

30:37.334 --> 30:40.504
<i>- Our furniture is</i> bueno
<i>- Our furniture is</i> bueno

30:40.713 --> 30:44.299
<i>- Tampico is the name-o
- Tampico is the name-o</i>

30:54.852 --> 30:57.896
Pretty moronic. But what can you do?

30:58.105 --> 31:01.817
Well, it did tend
to stick in your head.

31:02.026 --> 31:05.779
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.

31:05.988 --> 31:09.950
Oh, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.411
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

31:13.996 --> 31:17.958
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven. "'

31:20.169 --> 31:23.172
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I...

31:23.714 --> 31:28.552
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

31:28.761 --> 31:31.930
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.

31:32.139 --> 31:33.349
We did use to sell cribs.

31:35.601 --> 31:38.145
A crib, then, okay. A crib.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.481
Yeah. No, I remember that.

31:40.689 --> 31:46.737
In fact, I remember recognizing
your dad from those commercials.

31:46.945 --> 31:50.366
Although, he wasn't anywhere near
as friendly in real life.

31:50.574 --> 31:52.493
Yeah. No shit.

31:52.701 --> 31:55.204
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

31:55.704 --> 31:57.665
Yeah, he probably did.

31:57.873 --> 32:00.250
And I was probably dumb enough
to buy it.

32:00.459 --> 32:02.378
Yeah, that was his big thing.

32:02.586 --> 32:04.213
You ask him for a glass of water...

32:04.421 --> 32:07.383
...he'd tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

32:11.387 --> 32:13.806
- Did you work there too?
- Only my whole life.

32:14.348 --> 32:16.934
Up until the day I said,
"Fuck you," and quit.

32:21.271 --> 32:23.023
So...

32:24.817 --> 32:27.569
...16 years ago,
how old would you have been?

32:28.988 --> 32:31.907
If it was after school,
trust me, I was there.

32:32.157 --> 32:34.159
Might have even helped ring you up.

32:34.368 --> 32:38.080
You and your extended warranty
on the crib.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.757
Small world.

32:50.092 --> 32:52.011
It is.

32:53.387 --> 32:55.973
The paths we take, huh?

33:21.540 --> 33:23.959
Jesse know you've got cancer?

33:26.920 --> 33:28.964
No one but you.

33:30.466 --> 33:33.218
- Not your family?
- No.

33:35.095 --> 33:36.638
Why not?

33:40.392 --> 33:45.272
Not a conversation
that I'm even remotely ready to have.

33:47.608 --> 33:49.610
That's why you're cooking meth?

33:50.486 --> 33:52.905
You wanna leave money
for your family.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.659
Hell.

33:56.909 --> 33:59.662
I'll write you a check right now
if you let me go.

34:05.292 --> 34:07.544
Like I said, Walter...

34:08.212 --> 34:11.131
...if this line of work
doesn't suit you...

34:15.844 --> 34:18.138
...get out before it's too late.

34:24.436 --> 34:26.939
I don't know what to do.

34:37.157 --> 34:38.325
You do.

34:57.511 --> 34:59.680
I'll get the key.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.325
No.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.452
No.

36:45.828 --> 36:48.330
Oh, no, no, no.

37:00.175 --> 37:02.428
No. No, don't do this.

37:02.636 --> 37:05.889
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

37:06.557 --> 37:09.226
Why are you doing this?

37:42.384 --> 37:44.553
You're doing the right thing, Walter.

37:51.643 --> 37:53.520
Do you wanna?

38:08.369 --> 38:12.164
So you're not angry?

38:14.750 --> 38:16.669
Angry at you?

38:18.962 --> 38:21.256
Live and let live, man.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.636
That's very understanding.

38:25.844 --> 38:27.680
Whatever, man.

38:27.888 --> 38:30.015
I just wanna go home.

38:35.938 --> 38:37.690
Me too.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.574
Unlock me, Walter.

39:03.173 --> 39:05.467
The moment I do...

39:07.052 --> 39:10.014
...are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

39:38.876 --> 39:40.627
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.671
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:45.132 --> 39:46.675
I'm sorry.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.642
I'm sorry.

39:55.934 --> 39:58.145
I'm so sorry.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.777
Hello?

41:29.778 --> 41:32.114
Anybody down here?

42:39.515 --> 42:41.600
Everybody...

42:42.559 --> 42:45.187
...I need you all to take your seats.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.190
Settle down, please. Thank you.

42:48.399 --> 42:51.151
I understand
that Mr. White is feeling...

42:51.360 --> 42:53.946
...a little under the weather
this morning.

42:54.154 --> 42:59.118
So you folks are going to have
to be making do with me today.

42:59.326 --> 43:03.580
And we are going to be watching
a very interesting video...

43:03.789 --> 43:07.251
...on carbon.

43:07.501 --> 43:08.711
Very important stuff.

43:12.214 --> 43:15.801
- So, what do you think?
- It's a cook site. Gotta be.

43:16.010 --> 43:19.263
Nobody came way the hell out here
just to buy.

43:19.471 --> 43:22.224
Fire there could have started
by accident.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.935
I don't think that was meant
to destroy evidence.

43:25.644 --> 43:28.981
Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

43:29.189 --> 43:32.443
So, what, they're in
some sort of camper-slash-lab?

43:32.651 --> 43:35.696
They accidentally start a fire
and everybody FOs?

43:35.904 --> 43:37.573
Yeah. Why not?

43:37.781 --> 43:40.868
So why did that little hair-gelled shit
leave his car?

43:44.204 --> 43:49.126
- Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
- It's a rich and vibrant culture.

43:49.335 --> 43:51.587
It's a car that jumps up and down.

43:52.046 --> 43:53.255
What the hell?

43:53.464 --> 43:56.592
You people used to be conquistadors,
for chrissake.

43:56.800 --> 44:00.888
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

44:01.305 --> 44:02.848
I already searched it.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.184
Yeah.

44:06.101 --> 44:08.103
You're wasting your time.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.940
Give it up. If this here's a trap car,
it's gonna take more...

44:12.149 --> 44:14.818
- ...than your dumb white ass to find it.
- Oh, yeah?

44:15.027 --> 44:18.989
You are talking to the trap-car master,
my friend.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.492
I'm Rain Man counting
his toothpicks.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.578
Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded.

44:32.211 --> 44:33.629
Yeah, baby.

44:37.841 --> 44:40.386
- Hello, zippy.
- Asshole.

44:41.261 --> 44:45.099
Sort of looks like meth
but it's too damn white.

44:47.643 --> 44:49.395
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?

44:49.603 --> 44:52.314
Yep. Somebody croaked our snitch.

44:52.523 --> 44:53.983
Hey, agent.

44:54.191 --> 44:56.026
You got something?

45:30.728 --> 45:32.646
<i>I don't know.</i>

45:33.647 --> 45:36.066
It just... Doesn't it seem like...

45:36.275 --> 45:38.902
...something's missing?

45:39.153 --> 45:41.196
What about the soul?

45:52.791 --> 45:55.127
The soul.

46:02.509 --> 46:05.512
There's nothing but chemistry here.

47:10.577 --> 47:12.454
Skyler?

47:22.256 --> 47:24.883
There's something I have to tell you.
