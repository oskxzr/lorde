00:03.253 --> 00:04.423
<i>Hey, get out of the way!</i>

00:04.421 --> 00:05.961
<i>- Oh, my god, wait.
- Ow!</i>

00:05.964 --> 00:07.974
You're stepping on my toe. Jesus.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.796
Let me see! Yeah, I mean,
you don't really know‐‐

00:09.801 --> 00:11.221
‐ Oh, my god!

00:11.220 --> 00:13.010
Oh, my god, oh, my god. I
got it, I got it, I got it.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.513
‐ congratulations! That's amazing.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.684
- I think you go it.
- Oh, my god! Yes!

00:15.682 --> 00:16.982
- I think you got it.
- You do?

00:16.975 --> 00:18.435
- I do, I do, I do.
- Sorry, you guys.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.765
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.111
Wait.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.358
Oh, my god.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.113
Oh, my god. ‐ that is not real.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.573
That's not real. That's not real.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.243
‐ that's the lead.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.792
‐ oh, my god!

00:34.785 --> 00:36.495
‐ wait. ‐ that is incredible.

00:36.495 --> 00:37.745
Wait.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.576
‐ is there another list, though?

00:44.169 --> 00:46.169
Okay. ‐ oh, my god, no, I'm sorry.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.301
- ‐ no, it's fine.
- No, no.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.547
It's so fucked up you didn't get

00:48.549 --> 00:49.759
a role and I did.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.508
‐ no, it's fine. ‐ no,
it doesn't make sense.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.470
You're literally the best
actress in our school.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.430
Like, you're so much better than me.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.560
I don't want to do it without you.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.176
Oh, my god, Maya!

00:58.183 --> 00:59.813
‐ hi. Oh, my god.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.650
Thank you. ‐ I know! It's amazing.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.355
You're gonna be so good.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.355
‐ oh, my god. You're gonna be so good!
‐ hi. No, no.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.147
No, you guys. You don't even know.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.860
I've, like, never done this before.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.280
I've never acted. You're
gonna be so good.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.859
Stop saying that!

01:30.882 --> 01:31.972
‐ I'm not going in. ‐
you're incredible.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.427
‐ no, I'm not. I'm not. I suck.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.597
‐ you have to go in, Maya. ‐ I quit.
I'm not going in.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.885
No, please. I want you to go in.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.307
- You're better than me.
- First rehearsal!

01:37.306 --> 01:39.266
‐ I know! I'm so excited.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.556
No, I can't do it. Please.

01:40.559 --> 01:41.729
Just come in for a little.

01:41.727 --> 01:42.807
‐ I don't know. ‐
please, please, please!

01:42.811 --> 01:44.021
‐ no, it's embarrassing.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.361
Maya. ‐ no, I can't go in. Please.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.475
Please. Please. ‐ Maya. Maya.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.071
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.226
You want some milk? ‐ yeah.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.244
‐ all right.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.355
Shh.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.361
Latch.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.452
Maya, latch, latch.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.907
‐ Anna: That's better.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.326
‐ ‐ Maya, no.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.235
No. Ma‐‐ow! Maya!

01:58.243 --> 01:59.453
Ow! ‐ Maya?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.243
Yeah. ‐ are you coming in now?

02:01.237 --> 02:02.237
We're about to start.

02:02.238 --> 02:03.318
‐ yeah. ‐ hello.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.413
I'm sorry, who are you?

02:05.408 --> 02:07.698
- ‐ Anna.
- I just wanted to say that

02:07.702 --> 02:09.662
I know that you "cast" your
play already... Uh‐huh.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.122
But if you have an
understudy role, I'm free.

02:12.123 --> 02:13.793
‐ she's actually, like,
a really good singer

02:13.791 --> 02:14.961
and actor and stuff.

02:14.959 --> 02:16.879
She had this "ave Maria" solo

02:16.878 --> 02:18.378
a while back that was really good.

02:18.379 --> 02:23.129
- Here, sing it.
- ‐

02:29.682 --> 02:31.022
it's whatever.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.017
‐ wow.

02:32.018 --> 02:35.648
You have a really great range.

02:35.647 --> 02:37.567
But we're about to have our
first rehearsal now, Maya,

02:37.565 --> 02:39.315
so we're ready whenever you are.

02:39.317 --> 02:40.737
Great to meet you. Keep‐‐keep going.

02:40.735 --> 02:41.985
You're really some‐‐great.
‐ sure thing.

02:41.986 --> 02:43.396
Thank you.

02:43.404 --> 02:44.744
‐ okay. So it's just you.

02:44.739 --> 02:45.949
‐ okay.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.368
I'm sorry.

02:47.367 --> 02:48.907
No. Have an amazing time.

02:48.910 --> 02:50.700
You got it. ‐ no, I don't
want to go without you.

02:50.703 --> 02:51.703
You've got it.

02:51.704 --> 02:52.874
‐ I love you. ‐ I love you.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.919
‐ so, here we are. Congratulations.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.840
I'll give you a little backstory.

03:00.838 --> 03:03.378
The play is an original piece,

03:03.383 --> 03:05.263
which means I wrote it.

03:05.259 --> 03:08.889
And for you guys as the actors,

03:08.888 --> 03:11.178
my whole thing, my mantra,
it's gonna be real and honest.

03:11.182 --> 03:12.982
If you're not real and honest with me,

03:12.975 --> 03:14.885
if you're not real and
honest with yourselves,

03:14.894 --> 03:17.314
and if you're not real and
honest with each other,

03:17.313 --> 03:20.323
then this whole thing is bullshit.

03:20.316 --> 03:23.066
Now, there are four of
you in this ensemble

03:23.069 --> 03:24.399
and by the end of this rehearsal,

03:24.404 --> 03:25.824
there will be three.

03:28.199 --> 03:29.779
So who here doesn't belong?

03:32.370 --> 03:34.000
Come on.

03:33.996 --> 03:37.246
Ian, who doesn't belong?

03:37.250 --> 03:38.750
‐ um, I'm, um‐‐

03:38.751 --> 03:41.051
come on. ‐ sorry, it's just hard.

03:41.045 --> 03:42.045
Real and honest.

03:42.046 --> 03:45.046
‐ um, I think I would pick...

03:48.678 --> 03:50.848
Maya.

03:50.847 --> 03:54.597
It's just, in every drama
class since third grade,

03:54.600 --> 03:58.770
you haven't, um, showed
anything that I've noticed.

03:58.771 --> 04:03.321
I don't think you have,
like, "it" charisma.

04:03.317 --> 04:05.357
You're just kind of wild

04:05.361 --> 04:08.071
and out of control.

04:08.072 --> 04:09.872
Thank you, Ian.

04:11.492 --> 04:12.702
Well...

04:15.538 --> 04:17.038
That was just an exercise.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.631
Relax. You guys all belong.

04:20.626 --> 04:22.296
Relax.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.165
You're here. You're in.

04:24.172 --> 04:25.472
‐ ‐ good.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.295
Very real, very honest.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.630
Now we can start.

04:28.634 --> 04:30.644
Good job, guys. Really good job.

04:30.636 --> 04:32.096
Relax. Take a deep breath.

04:33.097 --> 04:34.177
How'd you guys feel?

04:55.119 --> 04:56.909
<i>Trailview middle school's</i>

04:56.913 --> 04:58.463
<i>performing arts showcase.</i>

05:28.027 --> 05:29.447
Oh, my god.

05:35.326 --> 05:36.446
Hey, Anna. ‐ hey.

05:37.495 --> 05:39.995
‐ want some duct tape?

05:39.997 --> 05:40.997
‐ what?

05:40.998 --> 05:42.578
‐ we're making wallets.

05:42.583 --> 05:43.883
- ‐ oh.
- Here.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.286
‐ oh. Ow.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.418
What are you guys doing here?

05:50.424 --> 05:52.304
We're techies. I'm the
lighting designer.

05:52.301 --> 05:54.011
Marissa's props.

05:54.011 --> 05:56.971
‐ ‐ sorry, babe.

05:56.973 --> 05:58.313
Master of props.

05:58.307 --> 06:00.097
We handle all the technical
elements of the play

06:00.101 --> 06:02.441
and build sets.

06:02.436 --> 06:04.056
‐ wow. Talented couple.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.980
Do you have, like, a
teacher or anything?

06:07.984 --> 06:09.404
- Supervisors?
- Kind of.

06:09.402 --> 06:10.492
Steve's a freshman

06:10.486 --> 06:11.856
and he's supposed to supervise us,

06:11.863 --> 06:14.203
but lets us do whatever till tech week.

06:14.198 --> 06:15.868
You mean hell week, peasants.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.077
'Sup, Steve?

06:17.076 --> 06:18.366
‐

06:18.369 --> 06:20.119
You two watch <i>final destination</i> yet?

06:20.121 --> 06:21.461
It's on my list.

06:21.455 --> 06:24.165
Horror's an easy genre to fuck up.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.836
Watch it, kone?

06:25.835 --> 06:27.545
Is it James wong's sonata?

06:27.545 --> 06:29.875
Obliviously not, but
you should watch it

06:29.881 --> 06:31.591
if you think films are worth watching.

06:33.384 --> 06:36.144
‐ okay, people. Very exciting moment.

06:36.137 --> 06:38.807
Getting our official show scripts.

06:38.806 --> 06:41.596
You only get one of these, so
take very good care of it.

06:41.601 --> 06:42.731
Go ahead.

06:42.727 --> 06:44.347
Highlight your character's parts

06:44.353 --> 06:45.613
and your dialogue.

06:45.605 --> 06:47.605
There are four highlighters there.

06:49.901 --> 06:52.191
‐ wow, Maya. You get
to highlight a lot.

06:53.988 --> 06:56.618
‐ whoa. Maya and Gabe kiss.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.196
‐ okay, Jessica.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.330
‐ no, Jessica's right.

06:59.327 --> 07:01.367
There is a kiss in the first scene.

07:01.370 --> 07:04.750
Which we are gonna have to make
as real and honest as possible.

07:09.795 --> 07:11.295
Anybody have any questions yet?

07:28.481 --> 07:29.771
Do you want to give it a rest?

07:29.774 --> 07:30.824
I'm trying to read.

07:30.816 --> 07:32.396
I'm just prepping

07:32.401 --> 07:34.741
<i>in case the judge decides
that I don't get the house.</i>

07:34.737 --> 07:36.527
<i>Okay?</i>

07:36.530 --> 07:38.320
Anna, look.

07:38.324 --> 07:41.334
I found your old Nintendo.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.827
‐ that's a broken game boy.

07:43.829 --> 07:45.459
We're trying to read.

07:52.463 --> 07:54.263
I'm the one that should
be worried, all right?

07:54.256 --> 07:57.426
It's not like that female judge
is gonna rule in my favor.

07:57.426 --> 07:58.796
All the more reason to help me.

07:58.803 --> 08:00.143
Anna, look!

08:00.137 --> 08:02.767
Your "most improved" trophy.

08:02.765 --> 08:04.845
Keep it? ‐ no.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.270
I don't know why I'd need that, so‐‐

08:06.268 --> 08:08.098
how 'bout your glitter? Keep that?

08:08.104 --> 08:10.444
You still love crafts, don't you?
‐ mom!

08:10.439 --> 08:12.229
I don't want any of that stuff.

08:12.233 --> 08:14.113
Like, I don't do that anymore.

08:14.110 --> 08:15.440
Glitter's for kids, Kat.

08:15.444 --> 08:17.784
You keep talking to us
while we're reading.

08:17.781 --> 08:19.241
Like, stop.

09:08.832 --> 09:11.582
‐

09:11.584 --> 09:15.174
Sheila was backing away from you.

09:15.171 --> 09:18.931
Sheila was backing away from you.

09:18.925 --> 09:21.005
Don't you dare make another drink.

09:21.011 --> 09:22.471
Don't you dare!

09:22.470 --> 09:24.510
I'm warning you, don't do it.

09:24.514 --> 09:27.314
Were you doing your
business with Sheila?

09:27.308 --> 09:29.188
Were you doing your business?

09:29.185 --> 09:30.595
Were you‐‐were‐‐

09:32.063 --> 09:34.483
were you doing your business

09:34.482 --> 09:37.532
with Sheila, you rat bastard?

09:37.527 --> 09:38.897
You rat bastard!

09:38.903 --> 09:41.363
Were you doing it with
Sheila, you rat bastard?

09:41.364 --> 09:42.574
Get away from me!

09:42.574 --> 09:44.414
Yeah.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.869
You get your hands off me, you pig.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.381
You know,

09:53.376 --> 09:54.746
I could call you mommy

09:54.753 --> 09:56.593
and you wouldn't know the difference.

09:59.674 --> 10:04.724
Mommy.

10:04.721 --> 10:07.181
Mommy, get me water. Get me turnips.

10:10.935 --> 10:14.105
Yeah.

10:14.105 --> 10:16.605
You're not a man.

10:16.608 --> 10:19.068
You know, a real man,

10:19.069 --> 10:20.319
he grabs a woman,

10:20.320 --> 10:21.490
he takes her by the neck, and says,

10:21.488 --> 10:23.988
"everything's gonna be all right."

10:23.990 --> 10:25.830
Oh, what?

10:25.825 --> 10:27.905
What, you gonna hit me?

10:27.911 --> 10:29.911
Yeah, that's what I thought.

10:32.624 --> 10:33.794
You don't even know what it takes

10:33.792 --> 10:36.752
to put your flesh
against someone else's.

10:36.753 --> 10:39.463
You just sit. That's all you do.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.474
You sit, you sit, and you sit,

10:41.466 --> 10:42.716
and you wait for someone to come by

10:42.717 --> 10:44.337
and tell you what to do.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.014
Well, you know what? I
ain't gonna do it no more.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.182
I'm not gonna sit.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.680
I'm not gonna wait around for anything.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.731
I'm gonna swim! I'm gonna fly!

10:50.725 --> 10:52.345
I'm gonna be the best goddamn person

10:52.352 --> 10:54.852
that ever fucking existed!

10:54.854 --> 10:56.694
You hear me?

10:56.689 --> 10:58.859
I'm it, baby.

10:58.858 --> 11:00.858
I am it!

11:11.871 --> 11:15.041
‐ a real man grabs a woman...

11:15.041 --> 11:17.501
Grabs a woman by the neck

11:17.502 --> 11:19.802
and‐‐ya hear‐‐

11:19.796 --> 11:23.086
it takes flesh...

11:23.091 --> 11:25.051
Takes flesh to g‐‐ ‐

11:25.051 --> 11:27.141
against someone's.

11:27.137 --> 11:28.387
Sorry.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.508
Can I start again?

11:29.514 --> 11:30.564
‐ mm‐hmm.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.059
‐ um...

11:35.061 --> 11:37.901
It's the flesh that takes
against someone else's‐‐

11:37.897 --> 11:40.897
what it feels against someone else's.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.820
‐

11:43.820 --> 11:46.820
‐ if it‐‐ ‐

11:49.033 --> 11:50.663
‐ when you feel the flesh against‐‐

11:50.660 --> 11:52.120
‐ sorry.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.830
Gabe, can you, like, stop
eating your sandwich right now?

11:54.831 --> 11:56.211
'Cause you're taking
me out of the scene.

11:56.207 --> 11:57.627
I'm, like, trying to‐‐
Greg: This is good.

11:57.625 --> 12:00.165
See, if you were really in the scene,

12:00.170 --> 12:03.050
then you wouldn't have been
distracted by Gabe's eating.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.507
You see that? ‐ yeah, I agree.

12:05.508 --> 12:08.298
I feel like I was in the scene
and I was, like, really‐‐

12:08.303 --> 12:10.853
‐ imagine you're in a theater
of 300 people, okay?

12:10.847 --> 12:12.267
- ‐ uh‐huh?
- Do you think they're all

12:12.265 --> 12:14.475
just gonna sit quietly and watch?

12:14.475 --> 12:16.765
People are gonna get up
to go to the bathroom,

12:16.769 --> 12:18.309
they're gonna be
whispering to each other,

12:18.313 --> 12:20.653
they're gonna be coughing, there's‐‐

12:20.648 --> 12:22.568
papers are gonna be crinkling
all over the place,

12:22.567 --> 12:23.567
but you can't stop.

12:23.568 --> 12:24.778
You gotta keep going.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.237
‐ I promise you, like,
I did this last night.

12:26.237 --> 12:27.657
I was really good.

12:27.655 --> 12:29.525
‐ if you're in the moment,
then you're not distracted

12:29.532 --> 12:30.952
with what's going on around you.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.200
‐ I was in the moment

12:32.202 --> 12:34.042
'cause that's happening in the moment.

12:34.037 --> 12:35.367
Right, where you were in that moment.

12:35.371 --> 12:36.791
- ‐ yeah.
- Not that one.

12:36.789 --> 12:37.829
‐ right.

12:37.832 --> 12:40.002
So...

12:40.001 --> 12:41.131
‐ okay.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.047
I'm telling you, one screw, man.

12:43.046 --> 12:44.586
- Two.
- Babe, listen to her.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.799
She's a carpenter.

12:46.799 --> 12:49.179
‐ freaking hot. Is the air on?

12:49.177 --> 12:50.797
No, they only put it
on during hell week

12:50.803 --> 12:51.803
for the actors.

12:53.223 --> 12:55.603
‐ you guys know I can make
myself cold on demand?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.140
It's 85 degrees in here

12:57.143 --> 12:59.273
and I'm fucking freezing.

12:59.270 --> 13:01.020
Steve, you've gotta show
me how you do that.

13:01.022 --> 13:02.482
Yeah, but like I was
saying, one screw‐‐

13:02.482 --> 13:04.362
here. You'll need this.

13:04.359 --> 13:06.569
- Two.
- What's two gonna do?

13:06.569 --> 13:09.199
‐ oh, I'm not really
sure I'm gonna stay

13:09.197 --> 13:10.407
'cause I don't know if
I'm really, like, built

13:10.406 --> 13:11.656
for this kind of thing.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.698
‐ "adapt what is useful,

13:13.701 --> 13:16.961
"reject what is useless,

13:16.955 --> 13:19.415
and add what is specifically your own."

13:19.415 --> 13:20.785
Bruce Lee.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.752
‐ hmm. Okay.

13:22.752 --> 13:26.462
‐ build yourself to build a set.

13:26.464 --> 13:28.634
‐ cool.

13:31.636 --> 13:35.136
‐ you don't know what it takes.

13:35.139 --> 13:37.059
I don't even know.

13:37.058 --> 13:39.598
Ya hear‐‐

13:41.854 --> 13:43.484
- ‐ okay.
- Sorry.

13:43.481 --> 13:44.611
‐ it's all right.

13:44.607 --> 13:46.357
We're gonna try something different.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.239
Put the script down. Script down.

13:50.196 --> 13:51.856
Plant your feet.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.074
Bend your knees.

13:53.074 --> 13:56.084
Slight bend so you can
have a little bounce.

13:56.077 --> 13:58.407
Now shake it out. Ha, ha, ha.

13:58.413 --> 13:59.413
‐ that's stupid.

13:59.414 --> 14:00.714
‐ shake it. Be stupid.

14:04.961 --> 14:06.591
Let those hands go.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.797
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

14:09.799 --> 14:11.089
Good.

14:11.092 --> 14:12.342
Now what are you scared about?

14:12.343 --> 14:13.853
‐ What?

14:13.845 --> 14:15.885
‐ what are you scared about?

14:15.888 --> 14:22.768
‐ nothing. ‐ what are you scared about?

14:22.770 --> 14:24.400
‐ dying. ‐ what are you scared about?

14:24.397 --> 14:25.517
‐ my dad!

14:25.523 --> 14:27.403
- ‐ good. Gabe, now.
- ‐

14:27.400 --> 14:28.530
take it from the end of that scene.

14:28.526 --> 14:30.276
Don't worry about the lines.

14:30.278 --> 14:31.278
You gonna hit me?

14:31.279 --> 14:32.569
‐ you gonna hit me? ‐ yeah.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.612
‐ all right, come and hit me.

14:33.614 --> 14:35.664
Hit me real good, right in the jaw.

14:35.658 --> 14:38.238
‐ you shut your goddamn face or
I'll give you a real shiner!

14:38.244 --> 14:39.834
‐ yeah, you think you're tough?

14:39.829 --> 14:41.619
Come at me, baby! I'm ready.

14:41.622 --> 14:42.832
I'm ready to feel something.

14:42.832 --> 14:45.292
I haven't felt something in years.

14:45.293 --> 14:46.923
‐ you say one more word, I swear‐‐

14:46.919 --> 14:47.999
‐ yeah, you swear what?

14:48.004 --> 14:49.634
You gonna cry home to your mommy?

14:49.630 --> 14:51.880
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

14:51.883 --> 14:53.723
‐ you shut your mouth. ‐ yeah, or what?

15:03.102 --> 15:05.652
‐ no clapping during rehearsal.

15:05.646 --> 15:08.856
Maya, Gabe...

15:08.858 --> 15:10.898
There it is.

15:10.902 --> 15:13.152
That was it! There it is!

15:13.154 --> 15:14.824
‐ wow, Maya, I was wrong.

15:14.822 --> 15:16.162
You have "it."

15:16.157 --> 15:17.157
‐

15:17.158 --> 15:19.868
I don't even know what happened.

15:19.869 --> 15:22.289
I was, like‐‐ I, like, blacked out.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.578
That was so weird.

15:23.581 --> 15:25.291
I felt‐‐like, I spit on you. I'm sorry.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.091
‐ oh, no. I loved that.

15:27.085 --> 15:29.545
Like, I didn't even feel it.
It made me so angry, like‐‐

15:29.545 --> 15:31.295
‐ ‐ like, in the scene, yeah.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.127
‐ I know. I'm, like‐‐look.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.432
I'm literally shaking right now.

15:34.425 --> 15:35.885
‐ oh, my god, me too. Look.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.020
Let's take ten.

15:47.021 --> 15:48.611
After the break, we're gonna
get into the kissing scene

15:48.606 --> 15:50.226
because I think we're ready.

15:50.233 --> 15:53.443
Just be honest and honesty will follow.

15:53.444 --> 15:54.654
Ooh!

15:54.654 --> 15:55.784
Shut up, dude.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.620
‐ yeah, stop.

16:00.201 --> 16:03.081
‐ Spielberg used two screws
in every beam in <i>jaws.</i>

16:03.079 --> 16:04.909
Look it up. ‐ no, one screw.

16:04.914 --> 16:07.504
You put in two screws and
you risk splintering it.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.920
‐ two screws ensure it doesn't break.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.090
‐ sorry. Oh, no, keep going.

16:13.089 --> 16:14.509
Be right back. Whoopsie‐daisy.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.047
‐ if we put two screws and we break it,

16:16.050 --> 16:17.470
it's all gonna be your fault.

16:17.468 --> 16:18.678
- It won't break.
- Yes, it will.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.888
No, it won't!

16:19.887 --> 16:21.347
‐ hey, sorry.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.717
Um, I was just thinking that,

16:23.724 --> 16:26.394
like, maybe they could
just stop arguing.

16:26.394 --> 16:27.734
It would be a little bit more efficient

16:27.728 --> 16:30.688
if they just tried,
like, the two screws

16:30.690 --> 16:32.400
'cause I already finished,
like, six beams

16:32.400 --> 16:34.940
and we can't really move
on till that one's done.

16:34.944 --> 16:38.074
So maybe you could just
say something or...

16:38.072 --> 16:40.412
‐ why don't you say it to them?

16:40.408 --> 16:41.988
‐ okay, sorry.

16:43.161 --> 16:44.661
We're not gonna get in trouble

16:44.662 --> 16:46.252
if we just do it my way,
and you know what? ‐ yeah.

16:46.247 --> 16:48.167
If it doesn't work, we can
just put in two screws.

16:48.166 --> 16:49.826
Fine, but I already know it's
going to work with one screw.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.594
‐ hey, so‐‐ Brendan: It won't work.

16:51.586 --> 16:53.666
‐ Sorry for interrupting.

16:53.671 --> 16:56.341
Not to be bossy, but I
was just gonna say,

16:56.340 --> 16:58.720
like, what's the point
of all the talking?

16:58.718 --> 17:01.428
‐ we're trying to build
this beam correctly.

17:01.429 --> 17:03.059
‐ right.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.095
But I'm just saying, like,
hell week's coming up,

17:05.099 --> 17:06.679
and, um‐‐

17:06.684 --> 17:08.814
‐ look, why won't you
guys just listen to me?

17:08.811 --> 17:11.111
‐ trust <i>me,</i> okay? ‐
there's a bunch of...

17:11.105 --> 17:12.355
Stuff that has to get done.

17:12.356 --> 17:14.066
We have to do it quickly

17:14.066 --> 17:16.566
and, like, I think you
should just make a decision

17:16.569 --> 17:18.819
and if you make a decision,
then we can just get it done

17:18.821 --> 17:20.111
and move on, and if you don't,

17:20.114 --> 17:21.954
then you're just wasting your own time.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.697
I'm sorry.

17:26.704 --> 17:27.914
It's just a thought I was having

17:27.914 --> 17:29.214
and I just wanted to share it,

17:29.207 --> 17:31.327
but it's probably stupid.

17:31.334 --> 17:34.754
‐ guys, I think she's right.

17:34.754 --> 17:35.884
‐ I know. I just wanted to‐‐

17:35.880 --> 17:37.880
"knowing is not enough.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.052
"We must apply.

17:39.050 --> 17:41.220
"Willing is not enough.

17:41.219 --> 17:44.349
We must do."

17:44.347 --> 17:46.887
Bruce.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.771
Okay, obi‐wan kone‐obi.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.268
What do we do next?

17:55.233 --> 17:57.693
Your scene work with Maya
was really inspiring.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.660
‐ oh, uh, thanks.

18:00.655 --> 18:01.815
Yo, Gabe!

18:01.822 --> 18:04.032
‐ heard you guys had a crazy sleepover.

18:04.033 --> 18:05.163
What a ridic‐‐

18:05.159 --> 18:06.449
like you weren't doing the same thing?

18:06.452 --> 18:07.792
Come on.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.287
‐ at least I wasn't
tag‐teaming like you homos.

18:09.288 --> 18:10.538
Okay.

18:10.540 --> 18:12.830
‐ yeah, well, this homo
gets to kiss Maya,

18:12.833 --> 18:15.553
so who's the homo now, faggots?

18:15.545 --> 18:17.665
‐ well, yeah, you know it's
not a real kiss, though.

18:17.672 --> 18:18.712
'Cause it's in a play.

18:18.714 --> 18:19.884
‐ yeah, well, she's hot,

18:19.882 --> 18:22.932
so I don't care if it's real or not.

18:22.927 --> 18:23.967
‐ okay.

18:23.970 --> 18:24.970
Okay.

18:27.306 --> 18:29.056
- ‐ later.
- ‐ later.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.779
‐ half beam, go.

18:37.775 --> 18:39.235
Faster. Go.

18:39.235 --> 18:40.605
Yes. Move.

18:40.611 --> 18:42.111
Sorry to say that.

18:42.113 --> 18:43.493
Bring it in. Faster. Yes.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.159
Yes, you guys. Yes. Support.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.537
Support is my middle name.

18:47.535 --> 18:48.825
Oh, my god.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.998
We're good.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.367
<i>All right, gang. Welcome back.</i>

18:52.373 --> 18:54.673
So let's take it from the end

18:54.667 --> 18:57.547
of the first scene

18:57.545 --> 19:00.375
at the line, "get away."

19:01.841 --> 19:04.261
‐ get away from me.

19:04.260 --> 19:07.140
‐ isn't this what you want?

19:07.138 --> 19:08.258
‐ you don't know the first thing

19:08.264 --> 19:09.314
about what I want.

19:09.307 --> 19:11.637
You get your hands off me, you pig!

19:11.642 --> 19:14.812
Oh!

19:14.812 --> 19:16.442
Or what?

19:27.074 --> 19:30.124
Uh, sorry, uh... Hold.

19:30.119 --> 19:33.209
Um, Greg, uh, can I have a
little aside with Maya?

19:33.205 --> 19:34.205
‐ whatever you need.

19:34.206 --> 19:36.576
Okay.

19:36.584 --> 19:38.254
I'm sorry. ‐ no, it's okay.

19:40.421 --> 19:41.631
Was it my breath?

19:41.631 --> 19:45.261
‐ oh, uh, no. It's just, um...

19:45.259 --> 19:48.429
Like, I just wanted to
make this official,

19:48.429 --> 19:51.519
you know, before we... Uh...

19:51.515 --> 19:54.015
Do it, so, like...

19:54.018 --> 19:55.438
Um...

19:59.357 --> 20:00.977
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

20:04.070 --> 20:06.070
You don't have to answer now. ‐ yes.

20:08.199 --> 20:10.409
‐ okay. ‐ okay.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.199
‐ sick. ‐ oh, my god.

20:13.204 --> 20:15.414
‐ so, like, in rehearsal‐‐ ‐ yeah.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.964
‐ whenever we kiss, um‐‐

20:17.958 --> 20:20.998
in rehearsal, whenever we kiss,

20:21.003 --> 20:23.383
it's gonna be, like, Joe
and Debra, you know?

20:23.381 --> 20:24.511
‐ yeah.

20:24.507 --> 20:27.887
‐ and I want to kiss as Gabe and Maya.

20:29.303 --> 20:31.013
‐

20:31.013 --> 20:33.313
That's literally the
most romantic thing

20:33.307 --> 20:36.187
I've ever heard.

20:36.185 --> 20:39.395
‐ okay.

20:39.397 --> 20:41.857
So let's save it then.
Let's save our first kiss.

20:41.857 --> 20:43.897
‐ okay. So when?

20:43.901 --> 20:47.201
‐ for, uh, let's‐‐ first date.

20:47.196 --> 20:49.026
We'll do it on our first date.

20:49.031 --> 20:50.741
‐ so when?

20:50.741 --> 20:52.371
‐ the last night of hell week.

20:52.368 --> 20:54.788
‐ okay. ‐ okay.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.287
‐ wait, what's hell week?

20:56.288 --> 20:58.418
Oh, you'll see.

20:58.416 --> 21:00.246
‐ Oh, my god, they heard us.

21:00.251 --> 21:02.251
‐ they heard us.

21:02.253 --> 21:03.673
Guys, are we ready yet?

21:03.671 --> 21:05.591
- Sorry, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:07.174 --> 21:09.434
Like, just, like, the shading here

21:09.427 --> 21:12.757
and then it kind of has,
like, a vibe with it.

21:12.763 --> 21:15.023
The kind of feel of the night.

21:21.397 --> 21:23.477
‐ going into hell week, gang.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.232
It's gonna be intense.

21:25.234 --> 21:27.194
Sure, a play needs actors

21:27.194 --> 21:29.114
and writing, blah, blah.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.493
Actors suck!

21:30.489 --> 21:32.409
But it really is about
the behind the scenes

21:32.408 --> 21:34.158
that makes it all happen.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.500
And kone, you fucking led us there.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.916
I'm making you stage manager.

21:41.959 --> 21:43.589
‐ oh, my god.

22:18.496 --> 22:20.076
‐ hey. ‐ hey.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.540
‐ hmm.

22:21.540 --> 22:22.540
‐

22:22.541 --> 22:23.831
‐ oh.

22:23.834 --> 22:25.804
You looking for these?

22:28.547 --> 22:30.507
It's 4:00. Actors are called at 4:10.

22:33.469 --> 22:34.719
Oh.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.720
Let's go.

22:42.853 --> 22:45.823
‐ yeah, that's on me, guys. I
got the time all messed up.

22:45.815 --> 22:47.725
You're in the driver's seat, kone.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.863
Here's what's gonna happen. ‐ okay.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.860
‐ the actors are gonna
be so fucking excited

22:51.862 --> 22:53.032
to step onto stage,

22:53.030 --> 22:54.740
they're gonna walk around barefoot,

22:54.740 --> 22:56.740
but there are nails, there is sawdust,

22:56.742 --> 22:58.372
this is not a playground.

22:58.369 --> 23:00.329
You own the space.

23:00.329 --> 23:03.209
Don't let them‐‐ Maya:
Oh, my god, you guys!

23:03.207 --> 23:05.127
This is so big!

23:05.125 --> 23:07.705
This is crazy!

23:07.711 --> 23:10.211
This is, like, so big.

23:15.719 --> 23:17.599
Hey! Ha! Ha!

23:17.596 --> 23:20.926
Ha! Ha!

23:20.933 --> 23:22.313
Okay.

23:22.309 --> 23:23.519
Places for the‐‐

23:23.519 --> 23:25.899
it's not‐‐it's not, uh‐‐

23:25.896 --> 23:27.186
‐

23:27.189 --> 23:28.319
‐ turn it up.

23:28.315 --> 23:29.605
‐

23:29.608 --> 23:32.188
‐ Places for the top of act one.

23:33.571 --> 23:34.861
Please?

23:34.864 --> 23:37.784
‐ hey, Anna. ‐ hey, Maya.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.493
Please, can you do that?
And put your shoes on.

23:39.493 --> 23:41.453
‐ we usually rehearse
without shoes, but‐‐

23:41.453 --> 23:44.003
‐ and then we'll do places
for the top of act one.

23:43.998 --> 23:45.618
‐ okay.

23:48.752 --> 23:50.922
‐ guys. ‐ shoes are over there.

23:50.921 --> 23:53.761
‐ oh, god.

23:53.757 --> 23:55.337
‐ we have our shoes over here.

23:58.679 --> 24:01.469
I‐‐they're not back here. ‐ oh, my god.

24:01.473 --> 24:04.693
Tech week, people.
Take it from the top.

24:04.685 --> 24:06.095
‐ I saw you!

24:06.103 --> 24:08.363
I saw you with my own two eyes!

24:08.355 --> 24:09.935
Hold.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.320
Yeah, stay right there. Hold.

24:11.317 --> 24:13.067
‐ I didn't even finish my line.

24:13.068 --> 24:15.488
‐ kay, it's more important
that we mark this cue.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.777
It's a lighting thing.
You wouldn't understand.

24:17.781 --> 24:19.371
Okay, we got it. Act.

24:19.366 --> 24:20.696
You‐‐

24:20.701 --> 24:21.991
‐ oh, is it your line? ‐ yeah.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.374
I saw you with my own‐‐

24:23.370 --> 24:25.370
hold. ‐ oh, my god.

24:25.372 --> 24:26.712
‐ why do you keep going like this?

24:26.707 --> 24:28.577
If you're not gonna do that on the day,

24:28.584 --> 24:29.964
don't do that, okay?

24:29.960 --> 24:31.670
‐ seriously? ‐ did you get it?

24:31.670 --> 24:33.340
‐ yeah. ‐ okay, we got it. Act.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.339
‐ for ten years, you've told me‐‐

24:35.341 --> 24:36.591
hold.

24:36.592 --> 24:38.682
You're not in your light.

24:38.677 --> 24:40.047
Still not in your light.

24:40.054 --> 24:42.564
‐ I'd rather go to jail‐‐

24:42.556 --> 24:43.766
mai, that's you. ‐ line.

24:43.766 --> 24:45.176
‐ "I'd rather go to jail

24:45.184 --> 24:46.894
than spend one more minute with you."

24:46.894 --> 24:48.234
‐ I have it. Thank you.

24:48.228 --> 24:50.898
‐ to your left. Your left.

24:50.898 --> 24:53.148
The other left. ‐ Anna,
let me finish the line.

24:53.150 --> 24:54.690
Hold. Go 132.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.243
Hold. Hold, I said.

24:56.236 --> 24:57.696
Hold. Hold!

24:57.696 --> 24:58.906
Hold.

24:58.906 --> 25:00.236
- ‐ we're just getting up.
- Hold.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.740
Walk it through slowly
so we can get the marks.

25:02.743 --> 25:06.503
‐ Saw you with my own two eyes.

25:06.497 --> 25:07.667
‐ slower physical.

25:07.665 --> 25:09.115
‐ Rat bastard.

25:09.124 --> 25:10.714
‐ faster vocal.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.669
‐ I saw you backing away from Sheila.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.340
Sheila was a rat bastard. I saw
you backing away from Sheila.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.128
‐ what are you gonna do, Debra?

25:16.131 --> 25:17.591
You gonna divorce me?

25:17.591 --> 25:19.391
‐ I don't even know what
we're doing anymore.

25:19.385 --> 25:21.425
I'm really confused. ‐
can you do it full‐out?

25:21.428 --> 25:23.178
‐ I don't wanna do it
full‐out right now.

25:23.180 --> 25:24.600
I don't want to go at 100.
I'm gonna go at‐‐

25:24.598 --> 25:25.928
‐ if you are doing something different

25:25.933 --> 25:27.063
than what you're doing on the day,

25:27.059 --> 25:28.389
we're not gonna know our cue.

25:28.394 --> 25:29.484
‐ oh, my god.

25:29.478 --> 25:30.558
Please let us do our work.

25:30.562 --> 25:32.402
‐ uh, can you say it again?

25:32.398 --> 25:33.728
‐ you keep forgetting your lines.

25:33.732 --> 25:35.072
‐ okay, sorry!

25:35.067 --> 25:36.567
Find your light. ‐ is that it?

25:36.568 --> 25:37.898
Colder. ‐ is that it?

25:37.903 --> 25:39.153
‐ colder. ‐ is that it?

25:39.154 --> 25:40.364
Ice cold. ‐ is that it?

25:40.364 --> 25:42.744
‐ oh, my god. ‐ is that fucking it?

25:42.741 --> 25:44.371
Line? ‐ damn it, Maya!

25:44.368 --> 25:45.618
‐ I cannot act

25:45.619 --> 25:47.329
when you're yelling technical cues.

25:47.329 --> 25:48.659
I cannot do it.

25:48.664 --> 25:50.334
I don't know where the light is!

25:50.332 --> 25:52.382
‐ whose fucking beeper is that?

25:52.376 --> 25:53.536
‐ Did I find it?

25:53.544 --> 25:55.674
‐ this is our time in the tech world

25:55.671 --> 25:57.671
to make sure that you
guys don't mess it up.

25:57.673 --> 25:59.513
No offense. ‐ I can't feel it.

25:59.508 --> 26:01.138
‐ feel the warmth! ‐ give us space‐‐

26:01.135 --> 26:03.965
‐ take a‐‐take a‐‐ ‐ to
breathe and say our lines!

26:03.971 --> 26:06.681
If I can't say the
lines, then I can't act!

26:06.682 --> 26:08.392
‐ I‐I can't‐‐

26:08.392 --> 26:09.692
we're fucked.

26:11.186 --> 26:13.856
So it's really simple.

26:13.856 --> 26:17.186
I'm in my light.

26:17.192 --> 26:18.862
Not in my light.

26:18.861 --> 26:21.611
I'm in my light.

26:21.613 --> 26:22.613
Not in my light.

26:22.614 --> 26:23.914
‐ can I just interject?

26:23.907 --> 26:25.827
‐ yeah. ‐ it's called warmth.

26:25.826 --> 26:27.656
You feel the warmth when
you're in the light.

26:27.661 --> 26:29.501
‐ can I interject on his interjection?

26:29.496 --> 26:31.246
I'm not feeling warmth.

26:31.248 --> 26:32.418
Like, when I stand in the lights,

26:32.416 --> 26:33.576
I don't know about you guys,

26:33.584 --> 26:35.004
I don't feel it on my skin or anything.

26:35.002 --> 26:36.302
‐ these are grade a lights.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.415
‐ okay, we don't have a lot of time,

26:37.421 --> 26:39.171
so props.

26:39.173 --> 26:43.433
You guys need to put your props
back down on the props table.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.097
I cannot emphasize it enough.

26:45.095 --> 26:47.385
‐ sorry, but every time
Marissa places my prop

26:47.389 --> 26:48.769
on stage left,

26:48.766 --> 26:50.426
it's actually meant to be on
stage right where I exit.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.144
‐ actually, you're using the bottle

26:52.144 --> 26:53.194
at the top of act two

26:53.187 --> 26:54.607
when you should be using the broom.

26:54.605 --> 26:56.105
‐ okay, you guys, we don't
have time to talk about this.

26:56.106 --> 26:57.436
So basically, the thing is,

26:57.441 --> 26:59.571
is you just put your prop
back on the prop table.

26:59.568 --> 27:01.358
Maya, got a note for you.

27:01.361 --> 27:02.951
You gotta remember your lines.

27:02.946 --> 27:04.656
That's the only way
that we know our cues

27:04.656 --> 27:05.776
and you need to memorize them.

27:05.783 --> 27:07.163
‐ I did memorize them.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.239
If we had enough time to go
over them, I'd be able‐‐

27:09.244 --> 27:10.544
‐ Maya, we can't do the work for you.

27:10.537 --> 27:12.077
‐ I'm not asking you
to do the work for me.

27:12.081 --> 27:13.171
I was doing the work.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.955
'Cause you guys are doing tech

27:14.958 --> 27:16.838
and we're, like, doing art, so‐‐

27:16.835 --> 27:18.085
kay, tech is art, so‐‐

27:18.087 --> 27:19.337
‐ fuck the semantics.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.088
Just fucking remember your lines!

27:21.090 --> 27:22.720
‐ all right, all right, okay.

27:22.716 --> 27:24.676
- Very good.
- ‐

27:27.012 --> 27:28.812
‐ was that a cough, Gabe?

27:28.806 --> 27:31.516
‐ oh. Yeah, it's‐‐ I'm fine, though.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.057
‐ all right. Everybody freeze.

27:33.060 --> 27:34.350
We're done.

27:34.353 --> 27:37.613
I am not gonna have my
actors get sick, okay?

27:37.606 --> 27:39.976
Gabe, I'm not messing around, okay?

27:39.983 --> 27:41.693
Go home, steam your sinuses,

27:41.693 --> 27:43.783
and you gargle three times
with salt water, okay?

27:43.779 --> 27:45.859
Everybody else, techies included,

27:45.864 --> 27:48.744
go home, get some sleep,
at least eight hours,

27:48.742 --> 27:52.082
and please, please wash your hands!

27:52.079 --> 27:53.499
Thank you. ‐ I'm still‐‐

27:53.497 --> 27:54.747
we're done. ‐ okay. Memorize‐‐

27:54.748 --> 27:57.668
‐ good night. ‐ and
memorize your lines.

27:57.668 --> 27:59.038
Thank you, Anna.

27:59.044 --> 28:00.594
I'm sorry I'm yelling.

28:00.587 --> 28:03.377
‐ are we still on for
our date tonight or no?

28:03.382 --> 28:06.262
‐ I mean, I might be sick.

28:06.260 --> 28:10.430
‐ okay, well, I can take care of you.

28:10.430 --> 28:13.140
Sick boy.

28:15.435 --> 28:18.435
See you tonight, boyfriend.

28:20.023 --> 28:21.653
‐ yeah. That's me.

28:28.529 --> 28:30.029
‐ actually, that's the cue 32.

28:30.032 --> 28:32.742
Like, I'm just so‐‐ fucking hell.

28:34.328 --> 28:36.158
I can't handle these actors.

28:36.163 --> 28:37.663
Like, I can't.

28:37.664 --> 28:39.504
We didn't even have a dress rehearsal

28:39.499 --> 28:41.629
'cause they're so fucking incompetent!

28:41.627 --> 28:44.087
‐ shh.

28:44.087 --> 28:45.087
‐ sorry.

28:50.594 --> 28:52.934
‐ I was sweating bullets
2.6 seconds ago.

28:52.929 --> 28:54.559
Look at me now.

28:54.556 --> 28:57.476
‐ mm‐hmm.

28:57.476 --> 28:59.936
‐ this play's a pile of dog shit.

28:59.936 --> 29:01.936
But you can change it with your mind.

29:04.066 --> 29:05.686
You get me?

29:05.692 --> 29:06.902
‐ okay.

29:15.285 --> 29:19.665
‐ Gabe, you girlfriend's here.

29:19.665 --> 29:21.625
And she's so cute,

29:21.625 --> 29:23.495
I won't even leave the door open.

29:23.502 --> 29:25.132
‐ ‐

29:25.128 --> 29:26.338
‐ mom.

29:30.217 --> 29:31.547
‐ hi, boyfriend.

29:31.551 --> 29:32.841
‐ hi.

29:32.844 --> 29:36.564
‐ I brought masks and soup.

29:36.556 --> 29:38.766
‐ I don't think I'm sick.

29:38.767 --> 29:41.437
‐ well, just in case.

29:52.531 --> 29:55.701
‐ I love this song.

29:55.701 --> 29:58.751
‐ it's my favorite.

29:58.745 --> 30:00.535
‐ me too.

30:02.999 --> 30:04.169
‐ oh, my god.

30:04.167 --> 30:07.167
Rehearsal was, like, complete shitake.

30:07.170 --> 30:08.670
Literally.

30:08.672 --> 30:10.472
‐ literally?

30:10.465 --> 30:12.425
So it was a mushroom?

30:17.097 --> 30:18.217
‐ yeah.

30:24.646 --> 30:25.936
‐ what?

30:25.939 --> 30:29.529
