a lot of time,

26:37.421 --> 26:39.171

26:39.173 --> 26:43.433
You guys need to put your props
back down on the props table.

it's actually meant to be
on stage right where I exit.

‐ Okay, you guys, we don't have
time to talk about this.

26:56.106 --> 26:57.436
So basically, the thing is,

26:57.441 --> 26:59.571
is you just put your prop back
on the prop table.

26:59.568 --> 27:01.358
