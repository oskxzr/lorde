I'll give you
a little backstory.

99
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:03,378
The play is an original piece,

100
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,263
which means I wrote it.

101
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:08,889
And for you guys as the actors,

102
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,178
my whole thing, my mantra,
it's gonna be real and honest.

103
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:12,982
If you're not real and honest
with me,

104
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,885
if you're not real and honest
with yourselves,

105
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,314
and if you're not real
and honest with each other,

106
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:20,323
then this whole thing
is bullshit.

107

Now, there are four of you
in this ensemble

108
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,399

of this rehearsal,

You guys need to put your props
back down on the props table.

time to talk about this.

737
00:26:56,106 --> 00:26:57,436
So basically, the thing is,

738
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,571
is you just put your prop back
on the prop table.
