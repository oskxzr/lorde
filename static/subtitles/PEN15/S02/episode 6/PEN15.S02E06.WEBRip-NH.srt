1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,423
<i>Hey, get out of the way!</i>

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,961
<i>- Oh, my god, wait.
- Ow!</i>

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,974
You're stepping on my toe. Jesus.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,796
Let me see! Yeah, I mean,
you don't really know‐‐

5
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,221
‐ Oh, my god!

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,010
Oh, my god, oh, my god. I
got it, I got it, I got it.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,513
‐ congratulations! That's amazing.

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,684
- I think you go it.
- Oh, my god! Yes!

9
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,982
- I think you got it.
- You do?

10
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,435
- I do, I do, I do.
- Sorry, you guys.

11
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,765
Excuse me. Sorry.

12
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,111
Wait.

13
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,358
Oh, my god.

14
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,113
Oh, my god. ‐ that is not real.

15
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,573
That's not real. That's not real.

16
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,243
‐ that's the lead.

17
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,792
‐ oh, my god!

18
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,495
‐ wait. ‐ that is incredible.

19
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,745
Wait.

20
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,576
‐ is there another list, though?

21
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,169
Okay. ‐ oh, my god, no, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,301
- ‐ no, it's fine.
- No, no.

23
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,547
It's so fucked up you didn't get

24
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,759
a role and I did.

25
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,508
‐ no, it's fine. ‐ no,
it doesn't make sense.

26
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,470
You're literally the best
actress in our school.

27
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,430
Like, you're so much better than me.

28
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,560
I don't want to do it without you.

29
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,176
Oh, my god, Maya!

30
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,813
‐ hi. Oh, my god.

31
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,650
Thank you. ‐ I know! It's amazing.

32
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,355
You're gonna be so good.

33
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,355
‐ oh, my god. You're gonna be so good!
‐ hi. No, no.

34
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,147
No, you guys. You don't even know.

35
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,860
I've, like, never done this before.

36
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,280
I've never acted. You're
gonna be so good.

37
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,859
Stop saying that!

38
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,972
‐ I'm not going in. ‐
you're incredible.

39
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,427
‐ no, I'm not. I'm not. I suck.

40
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,597
‐ you have to go in, Maya. ‐ I quit.
I'm not going in.

41
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,885
No, please. I want you to go in.

42
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,307
- You're better than me.
- First rehearsal!

43
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,266
‐ I know! I'm so excited.

44
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,556
No, I can't do it. Please.

45
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,729
Just come in for a little.

46
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,807
‐ I don't know. ‐
please, please, please!

47
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,021
‐ no, it's embarrassing.

48
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,361
Maya. ‐ no, I can't go in. Please.

49
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,475
Please. Please. ‐ Maya. Maya.

50
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,071
Okay. Okay. Okay.

51
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,226
You want some milk? ‐ yeah.

52
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,244
‐ all right.

53
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,355
Shh.

54
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,361
Latch.

55
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,452
Maya, latch, latch.

56
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,907
‐ Anna: That's better.

57
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,326
‐ ‐ Maya, no.

58
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,235
No. Ma‐‐ow! Maya!

59
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,453
Ow! ‐ Maya?

60
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,243
Yeah. ‐ are you coming in now?

61
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:02,237
We're about to start.

62
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:03,318
‐ yeah. ‐ hello.

63
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,413
I'm sorry, who are you?

64
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,698
- ‐ Anna.
- I just wanted to say that

65
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:09,662
I know that you "cast" your
play already... Uh‐huh.

66
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,122
But if you have an
understudy role, I'm free.

67
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:13,793
‐ she's actually, like,
a really good singer

68
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,961
and actor and stuff.

69
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,879
She had this "ave Maria" solo

70
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:18,378
a while back that was really good.

71
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:23,129
- Here, sing it.
- ‐

72
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,022
it's whatever.

73
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,017
‐ wow.

74
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,648
You have a really great range.

75
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,567
But we're about to have our
first rehearsal now, Maya,

76
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:39,315
so we're ready whenever you are.

77
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:40,737
Great to meet you. Keep‐‐keep going.

78
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:41,985
You're really some‐‐great.
‐ sure thing.

79
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:43,396
Thank you.

80
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:44,744
‐ okay. So it's just you.

81
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:45,949
‐ okay.

82
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,368
I'm sorry.

83
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,907
No. Have an amazing time.

84
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,700
You got it. ‐ no, I don't
want to go without you.

85
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,703
You've got it.

86
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,874
‐ I love you. ‐ I love you.

87
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,919
‐ so, here we are. Congratulations.

88
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,840
I'll give you a little backstory.

89
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:03,378
The play is an original piece,

90
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,263
which means I wrote it.

91
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:08,889
And for you guys as the actors,

92
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,178
my whole thing, my mantra,
it's gonna be real and honest.

93
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:12,982
If you're not real and honest with me,

94
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,885
if you're not real and
honest with yourselves,

95
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,314
and if you're not real and
honest with each other,

96
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:20,323
then this whole thing is bullshit.

97
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:23,066
Now, there are four of
you in this ensemble

98
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,399
and by the end of this rehearsal,

99
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,824
there will be three.

100
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,779
So who here doesn't belong?

101
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,000
Come on.

102
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:37,246
Ian, who doesn't belong?

103
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
‐ um, I'm, um‐‐

104
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,051
come on. ‐ sorry, it's just hard.

105
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:42,045
Real and honest.

106
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:45,046
‐ um, I think I would pick...

107
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:50,848
Maya.

108
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:54,597
It's just, in every drama
class since third grade,

109
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,770
you haven't, um, showed
anything that I've noticed.

110
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:03,321
I don't think you have,
like, "it" charisma.

111
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:05,357
You're just kind of wild

112
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:08,071
and out of control.

113
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:09,872
Thank you, Ian.

114
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:12,702
Well...

115
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:17,038
That was just an exercise.

116
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,631
Relax. You guys all belong.

117
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,296
Relax.

118
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,165
You're here. You're in.

119
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:25,472
‐ ‐ good.

120
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,295
Very real, very honest.

121
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,630
Now we can start.

122
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,644
Good job, guys. Really good job.

123
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,096
Relax. Take a deep breath.

124
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:34,177
How'd you guys feel?

125
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,909
<i>Trailview middle school's</i>

126
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,463
<i>performing arts showcase.</i>

127
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,447
Oh, my god.

128
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:36,446
Hey, Anna. ‐ hey.

129
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:39,995
‐ want some duct tape?

130
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:40,997
‐ what?

131
00:05:40,998 --> 00:05:42,578
‐ we're making wallets.

132
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,883
- ‐ oh.
- Here.

133
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,286
‐ oh. Ow.

134
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,418
What are you guys doing here?

135
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:52,304
We're techies. I'm the
lighting designer.

136
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,011
Marissa's props.

137
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:56,971
‐ ‐ sorry, babe.

138
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,313
Master of props.

139
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:00,097
We handle all the technical
elements of the play

140
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:02,441
and build sets.

141
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:04,056
‐ wow. Talented couple.

142
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,980
Do you have, like, a
teacher or anything?

143
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:09,404
- Supervisors?
- Kind of.

144
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,492
Steve's a freshman

145
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:11,856
and he's supposed to supervise us,

146
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:14,203
but lets us do whatever till tech week.

147
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:15,868
You mean hell week, peasants.

148
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,077
'Sup, Steve?

149
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,366
‐

150
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,119
You two watch <i>final destination</i> yet?

151
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:21,461
It's on my list.

152
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:24,165
Horror's an easy genre to fuck up.

153
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,836
Watch it, kone?

154
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:27,545
Is it James wong's sonata?

155
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:29,875
Obliviously not, but
you should watch it

156
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,591
if you think films are worth watching.

157
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:36,144
‐ okay, people. Very exciting moment.

158
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:38,807
Getting our official show scripts.

159
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:41,596
You only get one of these, so
take very good care of it.

160
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,731
Go ahead.

161
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,347
Highlight your character's parts

162
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:45,613
and your dialogue.

163
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,605
There are four highlighters there.

164
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:52,191
‐ wow, Maya. You get
to highlight a lot.

165
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:56,618
‐ whoa. Maya and Gabe kiss.

166
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,196
‐ okay, Jessica.

167
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,330
‐ no, Jessica's right.

168
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,367
There is a kiss in the first scene.

169
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,750
Which we are gonna have to make
as real and honest as possible.

170
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,295
Anybody have any questions yet?

171
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,771
Do you want to give it a rest?

172
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:30,824
I'm trying to read.

173
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,396
I'm just prepping

174
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,741
<i>in case the judge decides
that I don't get the house.</i>

175
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:36,527
<i>Okay?</i>

176
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,320
Anna, look.

177
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,334
I found your old Nintendo.

178
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,827
‐ that's a broken game boy.

179
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,459
We're trying to read.

180
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:54,263
I'm the one that should
be worried, all right?

181
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:57,426
It's not like that female judge
is gonna rule in my favor.

182
00:07:57,426 --> 00:07:58,796
All the more reason to help me.

183
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,143
Anna, look!

184
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:02,767
Your "most improved" trophy.

185
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,845
Keep it? ‐ no.

186
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,270
I don't know why I'd need that, so‐‐

187
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,098
how 'bout your glitter? Keep that?

188
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,444
You still love crafts, don't you?
‐ mom!

189
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,229
I don't want any of that stuff.

190
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,113
Like, I don't do that anymore.

191
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,440
Glitter's for kids, Kat.

192
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,784
You keep talking to us
while we're reading.

193
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:19,241
Like, stop.

194
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:11,582
‐

195
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,174
Sheila was backing away from you.

196
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,931
Sheila was backing away from you.

197
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,005
Don't you dare make another drink.

198
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:22,471
Don't you dare!

199
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,510
I'm warning you, don't do it.

200
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:27,314
Were you doing your
business with Sheila?

201
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:29,188
Were you doing your business?

202
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:30,595
Were you‐‐were‐‐

203
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:34,483
were you doing your business

204
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:37,532
with Sheila, you rat bastard?

205
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:38,897
You rat bastard!

206
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:41,363
Were you doing it with
Sheila, you rat bastard?

207
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,574
Get away from me!

208
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:44,414
Yeah.

209
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,869
You get your hands off me, you pig.

210
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,381
You know,

211
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:54,746
I could call you mommy

212
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:56,593
and you wouldn't know the difference.

213
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:04,724
Mommy.

214
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:07,181
Mommy, get me water. Get me turnips.

215
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:14,105
Yeah.

216
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:16,605
You're not a man.

217
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,068
You know, a real man,

218
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,319
he grabs a woman,

219
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,490
he takes her by the neck, and says,

220
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,988
"everything's gonna be all right."

221
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,830
Oh, what?

222
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,905
What, you gonna hit me?

223
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:29,911
Yeah, that's what I thought.

224
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:33,794
You don't even know what it takes

225
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,752
to put your flesh
against someone else's.

226
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:39,463
You just sit. That's all you do.

227
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,474
You sit, you sit, and you sit,

228
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:42,716
and you wait for someone to come by

229
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:44,337
and tell you what to do.

230
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,014
Well, you know what? I
ain't gonna do it no more.

231
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,182
I'm not gonna sit.

232
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,680
I'm not gonna wait around for anything.

233
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,731
I'm gonna swim! I'm gonna fly!

234
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:52,345
I'm gonna be the best goddamn person

235
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,852
that ever fucking existed!

236
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,694
You hear me?

237
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,859
I'm it, baby.

238
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,858
I am it!

239
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,041
‐ a real man grabs a woman...

240
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,501
Grabs a woman by the neck

241
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,802
and‐‐ya hear‐‐

242
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:23,086
it takes flesh...

243
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:25,051
Takes flesh to g‐‐ ‐

244
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,141
against someone's.

245
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:28,387
Sorry.

246
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,508
Can I start again?

247
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:30,564
‐ mm‐hmm.

248
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,059
‐ um...

249
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,901
It's the flesh that takes
against someone else's‐‐

250
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,897
what it feels against someone else's.

251
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,820
‐

252
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,820
‐ if it‐‐ ‐

253
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:50,663
‐ when you feel the flesh against‐‐

254
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,120
‐ sorry.

255
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,830
Gabe, can you, like, stop
eating your sandwich right now?

256
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:56,211
'Cause you're taking
me out of the scene.

257
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:57,627
I'm, like, trying to‐‐
Greg: This is good.

258
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,165
See, if you were really in the scene,

259
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,050
then you wouldn't have been
distracted by Gabe's eating.

260
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,507
You see that? ‐ yeah, I agree.

261
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:08,298
I feel like I was in the scene
and I was, like, really‐‐

262
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,853
‐ imagine you're in a theater
of 300 people, okay?

263
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,267
- ‐ uh‐huh?
- Do you think they're all

264
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,475
just gonna sit quietly and watch?

265
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:16,765
People are gonna get up
to go to the bathroom,

266
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,309
they're gonna be
whispering to each other,

267
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:20,653
they're gonna be coughing, there's‐‐

268
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,568
papers are gonna be crinkling
all over the place,

269
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:23,567
but you can't stop.

270
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:24,778
You gotta keep going.

271
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,237
‐ I promise you, like,
I did this last night.

272
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:27,657
I was really good.

273
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:29,525
‐ if you're in the moment,
then you're not distracted

274
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:30,952
with what's going on around you.

275
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,200
‐ I was in the moment

276
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,042
'cause that's happening in the moment.

277
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:35,367
Right, where you were in that moment.

278
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:36,791
- ‐ yeah.
- Not that one.

279
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,829
‐ right.

280
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:40,002
So...

281
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,131
‐ okay.

282
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,047
I'm telling you, one screw, man.

283
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,586
- Two.
- Babe, listen to her.

284
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,799
She's a carpenter.

285
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,179
‐ freaking hot. Is the air on?

286
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,797
No, they only put it
on during hell week

287
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,803
for the actors.

288
00:12:53,223 --> 00:12:55,603
‐ you guys know I can make
myself cold on demand?

289
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,140
It's 85 degrees in here

290
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,273
and I'm fucking freezing.

291
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,020
Steve, you've gotta show
me how you do that.

292
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:02,482
Yeah, but like I was
saying, one screw‐‐

293
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,362
here. You'll need this.

294
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,569
- Two.
- What's two gonna do?

295
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:09,199
‐ oh, I'm not really
sure I'm gonna stay

296
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:10,407
'cause I don't know if
I'm really, like, built

297
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:11,656
for this kind of thing.

298
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,698
‐ "adapt what is useful,

299
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:16,961
"reject what is useless,

300
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:19,415
and add what is specifically your own."

301
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:20,785
Bruce Lee.

302
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,752
‐ hmm. Okay.

303
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:26,462
‐ build yourself to build a set.

304
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:28,634
‐ cool.

305
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:35,136
‐ you don't know what it takes.

306
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:37,059
I don't even know.

307
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:39,598
Ya hear‐‐

308
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,484
- ‐ okay.
- Sorry.

309
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:44,611
‐ it's all right.

310
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,357
We're gonna try something different.

311
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,239
Put the script down. Script down.

312
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,856
Plant your feet.

313
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,074
Bend your knees.

314
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:56,084
Slight bend so you can
have a little bounce.

315
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:58,407
Now shake it out. Ha, ha, ha.

316
00:13:58,413 --> 00:13:59,413
‐ that's stupid.

317
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:00,714
‐ shake it. Be stupid.

318
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,591
Let those hands go.

319
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,797
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

320
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,089
Good.

321
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:12,342
Now what are you scared about?

322
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:13,853
‐ What?

323
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:15,885
‐ what are you scared about?

324
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:22,768
‐ nothing. ‐ what are you scared about?

325
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,400
‐ dying. ‐ what are you scared about?

326
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,517
‐ my dad!

327
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:27,403
- ‐ good. Gabe, now.
- ‐

328
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,530
take it from the end of that scene.

329
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:30,276
Don't worry about the lines.

330
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:31,278
You gonna hit me?

331
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,569
‐ you gonna hit me? ‐ yeah.

332
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,612
‐ all right, come and hit me.

333
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:35,664
Hit me real good, right in the jaw.

334
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,238
‐ you shut your goddamn face or
I'll give you a real shiner!

335
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,834
‐ yeah, you think you're tough?

336
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,619
Come at me, baby! I'm ready.

337
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:42,832
I'm ready to feel something.

338
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:45,292
I haven't felt something in years.

339
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:46,923
‐ you say one more word, I swear‐‐

340
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,999
‐ yeah, you swear what?

341
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:49,634
You gonna cry home to your mommy?

342
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,880
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy!

343
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:53,723
‐ you shut your mouth. ‐ yeah, or what?

344
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,652
‐ no clapping during rehearsal.

345
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,856
Maya, Gabe...

346
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,898
There it is.

347
00:15:10,902 --> 00:15:13,152
That was it! There it is!

348
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:14,824
‐ wow, Maya, I was wrong.

349
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:16,162
You have "it."

350
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:17,157
‐

351
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:19,868
I don't even know what happened.

352
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:22,289
I was, like‐‐ I, like, blacked out.

353
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,578
That was so weird.

354
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:25,291
I felt‐‐like, I spit on you. I'm sorry.

355
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,091
‐ oh, no. I loved that.

356
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,545
Like, I didn't even feel it.
It made me so angry, like‐‐

357
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:31,295
‐ ‐ like, in the scene, yeah.

358
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,127
‐ I know. I'm, like‐‐look.

359
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,432
I'm literally shaking right now.

360
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:35,885
‐ oh, my god, me too. Look.

361
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,020
Let's take ten.

362
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:48,611
After the break, we're gonna
get into the kissing scene

363
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:50,226
because I think we're ready.

364
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:53,443
Just be honest and honesty will follow.

365
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:54,654
Ooh!

366
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:55,784
Shut up, dude.

367
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,620
‐ yeah, stop.

368
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:03,081
‐ Spielberg used two screws
in every beam in <i>jaws.</i>

369
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,909
Look it up. ‐ no, one screw.

370
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,504
You put in two screws and
you risk splintering it.

371
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,920
‐ two screws ensure it doesn't break.

372
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,090
‐ sorry. Oh, no, keep going.

373
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,509
Be right back. Whoopsie‐daisy.

374
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,047
‐ if we put two screws and we break it,

375
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,470
it's all gonna be your fault.

376
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:18,678
- It won't break.
- Yes, it will.

377
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:19,888
No, it won't!

378
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,347
‐ hey, sorry.

379
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,717
Um, I was just thinking that,

380
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:26,394
like, maybe they could
just stop arguing.

381
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:27,734
It would be a little bit more efficient

382
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:30,688
if they just tried,
like, the two screws

383
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,400
'cause I already finished,
like, six beams

384
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,940
and we can't really move
on till that one's done.

385
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:38,074
So maybe you could just
say something or...

386
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:40,412
‐ why don't you say it to them?

387
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:41,988
‐ okay, sorry.

388
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:44,661
We're not gonna get in trouble

389
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:46,252
if we just do it my way,
and you know what? ‐ yeah.

390
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:48,167
If it doesn't work, we can
just put in two screws.

391
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,826
Fine, but I already know it's
going to work with one screw.

392
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,594
‐ hey, so‐‐ Brendan: It won't work.

393
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:53,666
‐ Sorry for interrupting.

394
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:56,341
Not to be bossy, but I
was just gonna say,

395
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,720
like, what's the point
of all the talking?

396
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,428
‐ we're trying to build
this beam correctly.

397
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,059
‐ right.

398
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,095
But I'm just saying, like,
hell week's coming up,

399
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,679
and, um‐‐

400
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,814
‐ look, why won't you
guys just listen to me?

401
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:11,111
‐ trust <i>me,</i> okay? ‐
there's a bunch of...

402
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:12,355
Stuff that has to get done.

403
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:14,066
We have to do it quickly

404
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,566
and, like, I think you
should just make a decision

405
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,819
and if you make a decision,
then we can just get it done

406
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,111
and move on, and if you don't,

407
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:21,954
then you're just wasting your own time.

408
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,697
I'm sorry.

409
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:27,914
It's just a thought I was having

410
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,214
and I just wanted to share it,

411
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:31,327
but it's probably stupid.

412
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:34,754
‐ guys, I think she's right.

413
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:35,884
‐ I know. I just wanted to‐‐

414
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
"knowing is not enough.

415
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:39,052
"We must apply.

416
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,220
"Willing is not enough.

417
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:44,349
We must do."

418
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:46,887
Bruce.

419
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,771
Okay, obi‐wan kone‐obi.

420
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,268
What do we do next?

421
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,693
Your scene work with Maya
was really inspiring.

422
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,660
‐ oh, uh, thanks.

423
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:01,815
Yo, Gabe!

424
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:04,032
‐ heard you guys had a crazy sleepover.

425
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,163
What a ridic‐‐

426
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:06,449
like you weren't doing the same thing?

427
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,792
Come on.

428
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,287
‐ at least I wasn't
tag‐teaming like you homos.

429
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,538
Okay.

430
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,830
‐ yeah, well, this homo
gets to kiss Maya,

431
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,553
so who's the homo now, faggots?

432
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:17,665
‐ well, yeah, you know it's
not a real kiss, though.

433
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:18,712
'Cause it's in a play.

434
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:19,884
‐ yeah, well, she's hot,

435
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:22,932
so I don't care if it's real or not.

436
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:23,967
‐ okay.

437
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,970
Okay.

438
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,056
- ‐ later.
- ‐ later.

439
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:37,779
‐ half beam, go.

440
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:39,235
Faster. Go.

441
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:40,605
Yes. Move.

442
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:42,111
Sorry to say that.

443
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:43,493
Bring it in. Faster. Yes.

444
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,159
Yes, you guys. Yes. Support.

445
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,537
Support is my middle name.

446
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:48,825
Oh, my god.

447
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,998
We're good.

448
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,367
<i>All right, gang. Welcome back.</i>

449
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:54,673
So let's take it from the end

450
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,547
of the first scene

451
00:18:57,545 --> 00:19:00,375
at the line, "get away."

452
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,261
‐ get away from me.

453
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,140
‐ isn't this what you want?

454
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:08,258
‐ you don't know the first thing

455
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:09,314
about what I want.

456
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:11,637
You get your hands off me, you pig!

457
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:14,812
Oh!

458
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:16,442
Or what?

459
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:30,124
Uh, sorry, uh... Hold.

460
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,209
Um, Greg, uh, can I have a
little aside with Maya?

461
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,205
‐ whatever you need.

462
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,576
Okay.

463
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:38,254
I'm sorry. ‐ no, it's okay.

464
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:41,631
Was it my breath?

465
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:45,261
‐ oh, uh, no. It's just, um...

466
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:48,429
Like, I just wanted to
make this official,

467
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,519
you know, before we... Uh...

468
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:54,015
Do it, so, like...

469
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,438
Um...

470
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:00,977
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

471
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,070
You don't have to answer now. ‐ yes.

472
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,409
‐ okay. ‐ okay.

473
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,199
‐ sick. ‐ oh, my god.

474
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:15,414
‐ so, like, in rehearsal‐‐ ‐ yeah.

475
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,964
‐ whenever we kiss, um‐‐

476
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,998
in rehearsal, whenever we kiss,

477
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:23,383
it's gonna be, like, Joe
and Debra, you know?

478
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:24,511
‐ yeah.

479
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:27,887
‐ and I want to kiss as Gabe and Maya.

480
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:31,013
‐

481
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:33,313
That's literally the
most romantic thing

482
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:36,187
I've ever heard.

483
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:39,395
‐ okay.

484
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:41,857
So let's save it then.
Let's save our first kiss.

485
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:43,897
‐ okay. So when?

486
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:47,201
‐ for, uh, let's‐‐ first date.

487
00:20:47,196 --> 00:20:49,026
We'll do it on our first date.

488
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:50,741
‐ so when?

489
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:52,371
‐ the last night of hell week.

490
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:54,788
‐ okay. ‐ okay.

491
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,287
‐ wait, what's hell week?

492
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,418
Oh, you'll see.

493
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,246
‐ Oh, my god, they heard us.

494
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,251
‐ they heard us.

495
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,673
Guys, are we ready yet?

496
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:05,591
- Sorry, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

497
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:09,434
Like, just, like, the shading here

498
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:12,757
and then it kind of has,
like, a vibe with it.

499
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:15,023
The kind of feel of the night.

500
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:23,477
‐ going into hell week, gang.

501
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,232
It's gonna be intense.

502
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:27,194
Sure, a play needs actors

503
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:29,114
and writing, blah, blah.

504
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:30,493
Actors suck!

505
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,409
But it really is about
the behind the scenes

506
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:34,158
that makes it all happen.

507
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,500
And kone, you fucking led us there.

508
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,916
I'm making you stage manager.

509
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,589
‐ oh, my god.

510
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:20,076
‐ hey. ‐ hey.

511
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,540
‐ hmm.

512
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,540
‐

513
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,831
‐ oh.

514
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,804
You looking for these?

515
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,507
It's 4:00. Actors are called at 4:10.

516
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:34,719
Oh.

517
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Let's go.

518
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:45,823
‐ yeah, that's on me, guys. I
got the time all messed up.

519
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:47,725
You're in the driver's seat, kone.

520
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,863
Here's what's gonna happen. ‐ okay.

521
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,860
‐ the actors are gonna
be so fucking excited

522
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,032
to step onto stage,

523
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,740
they're gonna walk around barefoot,

524
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,740
but there are nails, there is sawdust,

525
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,372
this is not a playground.

526
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:00,329
You own the space.

527
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:03,209
Don't let them‐‐ Maya:
Oh, my god, you guys!

528
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:05,127
This is so big!

529
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,705
This is crazy!

530
00:23:07,711 --> 00:23:10,211
This is, like, so big.

531
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,599
Hey! Ha! Ha!

532
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,926
Ha! Ha!

533
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,313
Okay.

534
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:23,519
Places for the‐‐

535
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,899
it's not‐‐it's not, uh‐‐

536
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:27,186
‐

537
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:28,319
‐ turn it up.

538
00:23:28,315 --> 00:23:29,605
‐

539
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,188
‐ Places for the top of act one.

540
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:34,861
Please?

541
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:37,784
‐ hey, Anna. ‐ hey, Maya.

542
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,493
Please, can you do that?
And put your shoes on.

543
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:41,453
‐ we usually rehearse
without shoes, but‐‐

544
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,003
‐ and then we'll do places
for the top of act one.

545
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:45,618
‐ okay.

546
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:50,922
‐ guys. ‐ shoes are over there.

547
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:53,761
‐ oh, god.

548
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:55,337
‐ we have our shoes over here.

549
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,469
I‐‐they're not back here. ‐ oh, my god.

550
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,693
Tech week, people.
Take it from the top.

551
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:06,095
‐ I saw you!

552
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:08,363
I saw you with my own two eyes!

553
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:09,935
Hold.

554
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,320
Yeah, stay right there. Hold.

555
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,067
‐ I didn't even finish my line.

556
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:15,488
‐ kay, it's more important
that we mark this cue.

557
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,777
It's a lighting thing.
You wouldn't understand.

558
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:19,371
Okay, we got it. Act.

559
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:20,696
You‐‐

560
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:21,991
‐ oh, is it your line? ‐ yeah.

561
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,374
I saw you with my own‐‐

562
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,370
hold. ‐ oh, my god.

563
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:26,712
‐ why do you keep going like this?

564
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:28,577
If you're not gonna do that on the day,

565
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:29,964
don't do that, okay?

566
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,670
‐ seriously? ‐ did you get it?

567
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,340
‐ yeah. ‐ okay, we got it. Act.

568
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,339
‐ for ten years, you've told me‐‐

569
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,591
hold.

570
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:38,682
You're not in your light.

571
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,047
Still not in your light.

572
00:24:40,054 --> 00:24:42,564
‐ I'd rather go to jail‐‐

573
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:43,766
mai, that's you. ‐ line.

574
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:45,176
‐ "I'd rather go to jail

575
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,894
than spend one more minute with you."

576
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,234
‐ I have it. Thank you.

577
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:50,898
‐ to your left. Your left.

578
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:53,148
The other left. ‐ Anna,
let me finish the line.

579
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,690
Hold. Go 132.

580
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,243
Hold. Hold, I said.

581
00:24:56,236 --> 00:24:57,696
Hold. Hold!

582
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:58,906
Hold.

583
00:24:58,906 --> 00:25:00,236
- ‐ we're just getting up.
- Hold.

584
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,740
Walk it through slowly
so we can get the marks.

585
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:06,503
‐ Saw you with my own two eyes.

586
00:25:06,497 --> 00:25:07,667
‐ slower physical.

587
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:09,115
‐ Rat bastard.

588
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:10,714
‐ faster vocal.

589
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,669
‐ I saw you backing away from Sheila.

590
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,340
Sheila was a rat bastard. I saw
you backing away from Sheila.

591
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:16,128
‐ what are you gonna do, Debra?

592
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:17,591
You gonna divorce me?

593
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:19,391
‐ I don't even know what
we're doing anymore.

594
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:21,425
I'm really confused. ‐
can you do it full‐out?

595
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:23,178
‐ I don't wanna do it
full‐out right now.

596
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,600
I don't want to go at 100.
I'm gonna go at‐‐

597
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:25,928
‐ if you are doing something different

598
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,063
than what you're doing on the day,

599
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,389
we're not gonna know our cue.

600
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:29,484
‐ oh, my god.

601
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:30,558
Please let us do our work.

602
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,402
‐ uh, can you say it again?

603
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,728
‐ you keep forgetting your lines.

604
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,072
‐ okay, sorry!

605
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,567
Find your light. ‐ is that it?

606
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,898
Colder. ‐ is that it?

607
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,153
‐ colder. ‐ is that it?

608
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:40,364
Ice cold. ‐ is that it?

609
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,744
‐ oh, my god. ‐ is that fucking it?

610
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,371
Line? ‐ damn it, Maya!

611
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:45,618
‐ I cannot act

612
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:47,329
when you're yelling technical cues.

613
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:48,659
I cannot do it.

614
00:25:48,664 --> 00:25:50,334
I don't know where the light is!

615
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,382
‐ whose fucking beeper is that?

616
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:53,536
‐ Did I find it?

617
00:25:53,544 --> 00:25:55,674
‐ this is our time in the tech world

618
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:57,671
to make sure that you
guys don't mess it up.

619
00:25:57,673 --> 00:25:59,513
No offense. ‐ I can't feel it.

620
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:01,138
‐ feel the warmth! ‐ give us space‐‐

621
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:03,965
‐ take a‐‐take a‐‐ ‐ to
breathe and say our lines!

622
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:06,681
If I can't say the
lines, then I can't act!

623
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:08,392
‐ I‐I can't‐‐

624
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:09,692
we're fucked.

625
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:13,856
So it's really simple.

626
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:17,186
I'm in my light.

627
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:18,862
Not in my light.

628
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:21,611
I'm in my light.

629
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,613
Not in my light.

630
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,914
‐ can I just interject?

631
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:25,827
‐ yeah. ‐ it's called warmth.

632
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:27,656
You feel the warmth when
you're in the light.

633
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:29,501
‐ can I interject on his interjection?

634
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:31,246
I'm not feeling warmth.

635
00:26:31,248 --> 00:26:32,418
Like, when I stand in the lights,

636
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,576
I don't know about you guys,

637
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,004
I don't feel it on my skin or anything.

638
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,302
‐ these are grade a lights.

639
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:37,415
‐ okay, we don't have a lot of time,

640
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:39,171
so props.

641
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:43,433
You guys need to put your props
back down on the props table.

642
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:45,097
I cannot emphasize it enough.

643
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:47,385
‐ sorry, but every time
Marissa places my prop

644
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:48,769
on stage left,

645
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:50,426
it's actually meant to be on
stage right where I exit.

646
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,144
‐ actually, you're using the bottle

647
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,194
at the top of act two

648
00:26:53,187 --> 00:26:54,607
when you should be using the broom.

649
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,105
‐ okay, you guys, we don't
have time to talk about this.

650
00:26:56,106 --> 00:26:57,436
So basically, the thing is,

651
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,571
is you just put your prop
back on the prop table.

652
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,358
Maya, got a note for you.

653
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:02,951
You gotta remember your lines.

654
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:04,656
That's the only way
that we know our cues

655
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,776
and you need to memorize them.

656
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:07,163
‐ I did memorize them.

657
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,239
If we had enough time to go
over them, I'd be able‐‐

658
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:10,544
‐ Maya, we can't do the work for you.

659
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:12,077
‐ I'm not asking you
to do the work for me.

660
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:13,171
I was doing the work.

661
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,955
'Cause you guys are doing tech

662
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,838
and we're, like, doing art, so‐‐

663
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,085
kay, tech is art, so‐‐

664
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:19,337
‐ fuck the semantics.

665
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,088
Just fucking remember your lines!

666
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,720
‐ all right, all right, okay.

667
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:24,676
- Very good.
- ‐

668
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,812
‐ was that a cough, Gabe?

669
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:31,516
‐ oh. Yeah, it's‐‐ I'm fine, though.

670
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,057
‐ all right. Everybody freeze.

671
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,350
We're done.

672
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,613
I am not gonna have my
actors get sick, okay?

673
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:39,976
Gabe, I'm not messing around, okay?

674
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:41,693
Go home, steam your sinuses,

675
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,783
and you gargle three times
with salt water, okay?

676
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,859
Everybody else, techies included,

677
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,744
go home, get some sleep,
at least eight hours,

678
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:52,082
and please, please wash your hands!

679
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,499
Thank you. ‐ I'm still‐‐

680
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,747
we're done. ‐ okay. Memorize‐‐

681
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:57,668
‐ good night. ‐ and
memorize your lines.

682
00:27:57,668 --> 00:27:59,038
Thank you, Anna.

683
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,594
I'm sorry I'm yelling.

684
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:03,377
‐ are we still on for
our date tonight or no?

685
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:06,262
‐ I mean, I might be sick.

686
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,430
‐ okay, well, I can take care of you.

687
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,140
Sick boy.

688
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:18,435
See you tonight, boyfriend.

689
00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:21,653
‐ yeah. That's me.

690
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:30,029
‐ actually, that's the cue 32.

691
00:28:30,032 --> 00:28:32,742
Like, I'm just so‐‐ fucking hell.

692
00:28:34,328 --> 00:28:36,158
I can't handle these actors.

693
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:37,663
Like, I can't.

694
00:28:37,664 --> 00:28:39,504
We didn't even have a dress rehearsal

695
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:41,629
'cause they're so fucking incompetent!

696
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:44,087
‐ shh.

697
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:45,087
‐ sorry.

698
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:52,934
‐ I was sweating bullets
2.6 seconds ago.

699
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,559
Look at me now.

700
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:57,476
‐ mm‐hmm.

701
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:59,936
‐ this play's a pile of dog shit.

702
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:01,936
But you can change it with your mind.

703
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,686
You get me?

704
00:29:05,692 --> 00:29:06,902
‐ okay.

705
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:19,665
‐ Gabe, you girlfriend's here.

706
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:21,625
And she's so cute,

707
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,495
I won't even leave the door open.

708
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:25,132
‐ ‐

709
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:26,338
‐ mom.

710
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:31,547
‐ hi, boyfriend.

711
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:32,841
‐ hi.

712
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:36,564
‐ I brought masks and soup.

713
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:38,766
‐ I don't think I'm sick.

714
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:41,437
‐ well, just in case.

715
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:55,701
‐ I love this song.

‐ literally?

722
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:12,425
So it was a mushroom?

‐ yeah.

724
00:30:24,646 --> 00:30:25,936

725
00:30:25,939 --> 00:30:29,529

726
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:32,066

you to get sick, you know?

Here we go. ‐ kay.

736

Good? ‐ yeah.

I don't want you to get sick either.

Care to dance?

740
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:40,881
It feels like...

741
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:44,354
There's a bunch of butterflies
fluttering around in my chest.

742
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:52,646
‐ yeah.

743
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:56,016

now, without the masks on?

until opening night

745
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:01,611
to do our first kiss.

746
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:04,163
‐ but I thought you
said not to do the kiss

747
00:34:04,157 --> 00:34:06,907
as our characters, but
as Gabe and Maya?

748
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,290
‐ well, it's too late, you know?

749

We are Joe and Debra, Maya,

751
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:17,585
so...

752
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:20,587
