1
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,925
‐ huh! ‐ Anna, stop!

2
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,852
I'm not scared.

3
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,239
<i>‐ hey, guys. ‐ hey.</i>

4
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,356
<i>‐ hey, there.</i>

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,953
<i>Hey, what's the rush, slick?</i>

6
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,279
<i>Betty Ann's up tonight!</i>

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,453
You're not gonna
characterize me that way.

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,042
<i>It's not gonna happen. I told him Betty
Ann does really weird stories...</i>

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,327
<i>And he's been looking
forward to it ever since.</i>

10
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,752
<i>Ooh, pressure's on.
This better be good.</i>

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,551
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

12
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,005
‐ they, like, do this
sometimes, it's like...

13
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,045
‐ oh, my god, no, I'm‐‐ love this show.

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,469
I'm watching it.

15
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,677
[Show continues in
background[ It's so good.

16
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,098
- ‐ okay.
<i>- Siesta time, man.</i>

17
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,506
<i>- Ahh...</i>
- So scary.

18
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,144
<i>Most people think</i>

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,350
<i>dolls are just toys,</i>

20
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:02,271
<i>but they're really like
perfect little people.</i>

21
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,691
<i>And it's almost as if the
dollmaker took a person</i>

22
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,651
<i>and shank him down to doll size.</i>

23
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,111
<i>But that's not how
dolls are really made.</i>

24
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,743
‐ Anna, should I come? No.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,161
It's okay, you can stay.
‐ no, do you want me‐‐

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,200
<i>submitted for the approval</i>

27
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,334
<i>of the midnight society...</i>

28
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,461
Talk to me like you
aren't some jealous dick.

29
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,338
The point I was trying to make is

30
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,005
you don't bring in a paycheck
by doing "riee‐kay," okay?

31
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,965
It's <i>reiki,</i> asshole!

32
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,085
There you go! You know,
you're an asshole.

33
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,762
I married‐‐ we both know that
people are getting laid off

34
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,851
at my job, and you said you wanted
to help... You make me so mad!

35
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,347
And you're not helping! You're
the one that wanted a divorce.

36
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,059
- No!
- Yes!

37
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,349
We agreed that we didn't
want to be together.

38
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,443
‐ no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,519
We said it was a separation. We said it
was a separation! You're not going to

40
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,784
put this on me! And you're
making it impossible for me

41
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,896
to live with you! No, you
don't get to do that!

42
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,573
I'm talking!

43
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,452
You broke my dead mother's teacup!

44
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,829
What is wrong with you?

45
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,445
Shut up! Shut up!

46
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,559
‐ oh! Are you okay?

47
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,851
‐ yeah, yeah. ‐ are you okay?

48
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,234
- ‐ oh, yeah, are you okay?
- ‐ I'm okay.

49
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,072
Ha... Ha... Ahh...

50
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,833
‐

51
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,296
‐ oh, my god, Anna.

52
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,178
Wait. ‐ what?

53
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,796
‐ there were five leaves
here a second ago.

54
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,223
Now there's only three.

55
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,141
‐ Maya, stop.

56
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,929
You did that.

57
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,103
‐ no, I didn't do that.

58
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,731
Literally, a leprechaun came in here‐‐

59
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,857
I'm not even kidding you‐‐
and took two leaves away.

60
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,725
‐ Maya, stop! ‐ Anna!

61
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,982
Swear on my life I'm
not doing anything.

62
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,154
Have we never talked about
the little green man

63
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,823
that lives in the forest?

64
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,282
Swear! Look...

65
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,662
Five twigs‐‐ one, two,
three, four, five.

66
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,370
He's gonna come by and take it.

67
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,210
‐ where is he? ‐ you
have to close your eyes.

68
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,037
You have to close your eyes.

69
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,963
‐ don't touch it. ‐ I'm‐‐

70
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,052
hands are behind my back.
Hands are behind my back.

71
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,258
My eyes are closed.

72
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,348
Oh...

73
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,482
My god!

74
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,938
Anna! ‐ Maya...

75
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,358
‐ I did not do anything!

76
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,726
‐ I heard you... Move... Them.

77
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,324
‐ the little pitter‐patters?

78
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,069
That was his feet. That
was the green man's feet.

79
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,742
Swear on my life he lives here.

80
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,161
I'm not even kidding.

81
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:08,211
Is this magic? Like are we
freaking in magic right now?

82
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,745
‐ stop! ‐ did you not see the smoke

83
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,632
that came out of my mouth?

84
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,089
I'm a freakin' dragon!

85
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,339
‐ go again.

86
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,335
Maya, stop! ‐ get away from it.

87
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,933
‐ it almost caught me.
‐ it won't touch you.

88
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,428
I have a magic shield
covering your face.

89
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,350
‐ and when I do it, it
doesn't work‐‐look.

90
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,639
‐ I'm sorry, I have that pow‐‐ ‐ so your‐‐your
powers are stronger than mine right now.

91
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,904
‐ it's a natural skill.
‐ bring me to it.

92
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,937
Bring me to it!

93
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,440
Bring me to it!

94
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,953
Haa‐aa‐aa‐aa‐aah!

95
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,066
Haa‐aaa‐aaaa‐aaaa‐‐

96
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,852
- Maya.
- What?

97
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,057
‐ I'm stuck.

98
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,808
‐ hold on. ‐ I'm stuck.

99
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,690
‐ I'm gonna send you powers so the
jeans that trap your ass fly off!

100
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,517
‐ oh, my god, Maya! ‐ stop!

101
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,983
‐ Maya, Maya, Maya. ‐ stop, Anna, Anna.

102
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,243
‐ don't do that without telling me.

103
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,065
‐ I sent too many powers to your ass.

104
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,160
‐ yeah, but you have
to tell me next time.

105
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,275
‐ I know, I didn't want to surge
too much power in your ass.

106
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,242
‐ I could get killed by this tree.

107
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,413
‐

108
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,370
‐ seriously... Seriously. ‐ no, I know.

109
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,411
‐ I know it's crazy and
new, but I'm dead serious.

110
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,874
I know!

111
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,214
You think your parents

112
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,094
are gonna keep splitting
the house in half?

113
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,842
‐ um...

114
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,060
Maybe. Probably.

115
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,306
We're, like, still a family, so...

116
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,809
Aah! ‐ aah! Stop it!

117
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,651
Jk, jk. ‐ no‐‐anna, no.

118
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,186
‐ ‐ Anna, no, no.

119
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,649
‐ oh, my god!

120
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,279
‐ no, stop it, Anna! ‐ I
was joking, but look!

121
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,027
‐ stop it! ‐ this is in the tree.

122
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,528
- Stop!
- Oh, my god!

123
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,200
- Don't let it get away.
- Get it seriously.

124
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,949
‐ okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

125
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,701
Stop, stop, stop! ‐ what? Stop?

126
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,963
‐ why is there fricking
paper in the tree?

127
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,746
‐ paper comes from trees, you nut.

128
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,054
‐ or, what if it's...

129
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,554
‐ what?

130
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,429
What if it's‐‐ ‐ yeah.

131
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,636
What if it's‐‐ ‐ it's
Wendy Rochelle vicanny.

132
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,885
Wiccany.

133
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,563
Knock, knock, anybody home?

134
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,940
‐ what? ‐ it's mother witch.

135
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,266
It's mother witch. ‐
no, I know, but Anna,

136
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,902
that's a v, not a w.

137
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,479
‐ Maya, are you out‐‐ ‐ that's a‐‐

138
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,943
‐ are you serious? ‐ yeah!

139
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,033
‐ come on!

140
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,988
In Germany, they pronounce vs as ws.

141
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,699
Viccany is an alias for wiccany.

142
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,951
She has to just have that...

143
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,413
‐ oh, my god! ‐ to protect
herself with signs and codes.

144
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,044
‐ and‐‐and things like this... ‐ yes.

145
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,922
‐ like vs... ‐ and she
left this for us to know

146
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,208
that this is all real,
and this is a sign.

147
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,382
‐ oh, my god.

148
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,800
‐ hi.

149
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,390
‐ Hi, mother witch.

150
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,345
‐ with her power and her guidance,

151
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,716
we can ask for all the shite
we want in the world.

152
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,853
Anything we want!

153
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,059
Aah!

154
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,689
‐ oh, my god! ‐ Anna, anna‐‐

155
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,515
‐ did you do that? ‐ stop‐‐I
swear I didn't do that!

156
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,480
I didn't do that. Did you do that?
‐ no.

157
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,441
‐ Anna, you did that! ‐ I didn't‐‐oh,
my god. It's mother witch.

158
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,445
She did that. ‐ Anna, stop, stop, stop.

159
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,485
‐ oh, Maya, Maya, Maya. ‐ so that means
she's here and she wants us to do this.

160
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,080
‐ and she wants us to get
anything that we want.

161
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,236
- ‐ whatever we want.
- ‐ whatever we want.

162
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,124
- Oh, my god.
- ‐ oh, my god, stop!

163
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,332
‐ oh, my god‐‐okay. ‐

164
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,753
‐ what do we wish...

165
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,712
For?

166
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,512
What do we wish for? Rah, rah, rah.

167
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,258
What do we wish for?

168
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,139
- Rah, rah, ree.
- Go Maya.

169
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,546
‐ go, go, Anna, go! ‐ go, Maya.

170
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,354
‐ I wish for blonde hair! ‐ go, Maya.

171
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,848
‐ I wish for more money!

172
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,979
‐ I wish for my dad to be home!

173
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,846
‐ I wish I wasn't a problem!

174
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,023
‐ I wish for a bigger
house and no body hair!

175
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,403
‐ only one at a time. I
wish for white jeans.

176
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,862
And that the closet never
happened with Brandt.

177
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,612
‐ you just said one at a time.

178
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,744
For our <i>omikochan</i> to smell better!

179
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,491
‐ I wish I had my period.

180
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,583
‐ I wish for a group of
friends that love us!

181
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,129
‐ I wish for peace everywhere!

182
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,585
‐ wah, wah, wah, wah‐‐ yuki:

183
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,378
Maya.

184
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,303
‐ mom. ‐ hmm?

185
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,891
‐ if you were in <i>Sophie's choice</i>

186
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,506
and you had to pick one of us to die,

187
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,433
who would you pick, me or shuji?

188
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,682
You have to pick.

189
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,023
‐ I'll pick myself.

190
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,637
‐ no, that's not the point.

191
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,154
You have to pick a kid. That's like...
What it is.

192
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,778
‐ well, she'd obviously
pick you to die,

193
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,145
'cause she loves me more.

194
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,572
She's loved me a year longer
because I'm a year older.

195
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,701
Dill hole.

196
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,277
‐ "dill hole"?

197
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,043
Mom, is that true?

198
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,155
‐ shuji...

199
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,252
‐ okay, I knew it. So you
do love shuji more than me.

200
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,538
You'd pick me to die.
Is that what you'd do?

201
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,752
You'd pick your only daughter to die?

202
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,510
Guys.

203
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,715
It's okay. I don't really care,

204
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,426
'cause I have powers now, so...

205
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,387
I can reverse that easily.

206
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,662
Mom, look at me!

207
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,735
You clearly love shuji more
if you're not gonna even

208
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,911
look at your own daughter in the face.

209
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,913
‐

210
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,253
‐ mommy!

211
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,669
Stop! You guys, stop ignoring me.

212
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,548
- ‐ hello?
- Hello!

213
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,798
‐ daddy! Oh, my god!

214
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,547
Daddy!

215
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,224
‐ ‐ they were ignoring me!

216
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,394
‐ ah, oh, my tour ended early.

217
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,352
You didn't even tell me.

218
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,063
It's noth‐‐ I'll tell ya later.
Are you sure?

219
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,324
‐ oh, yeah, yeah, we're good. I
should leave home more often.

220
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,646
‐ my powers...

221
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,242
I'm a witch.

222
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,197
- Everything okay?
- No, I'm good, I'm good.

223
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,737
Okay.

224
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,870
‐

225
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,352
‐ can I get it?

226
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,233
Hi, you've reached the kones'.

227
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,230
This Anna. Who'd you like
to speak to, please?

228
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,783
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, Anna, it's Maya.</i>

229
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,396
<i>Anna, oh, my god, it worked.
My dad is home.</i>

230
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,914
What? <i>‐ yeah, he just came home.</i>

231
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,365
‐ wait, wait, what?

232
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,195
<i>‐ and my hair is more
blonde on one side.</i>

233
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,370
<i>It's crazy, like... Has anything
you wished for happened?</i>

234
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,710
‐ Oh, my god!

235
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:08,206
Um.... <i>‐ think about it, 'na.
This is really serious.</i>

236
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,299
<i>'Na.</i> ‐ um...

237
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,665
<i>‐ swear to god, wish again.</i>

238
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,972
<i>- Wish again.</i>
- ‐ okay.

239
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,296
Oh, my god. <i>‐ oh, my god.</i>

240
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,965
Hold on.

241
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,520
I wish my parents were back together.

242
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,777
‐ can you pass the salt, please, Kathy?

243
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,935
‐ lt's right next to you.

244
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,405
<i>Anna?</i>

245
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,000
<i>Anna.</i>

246
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,542
‐ sorry, no, I'm here. Um...
It didn't work.

247
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,923
<i>‐ oh, my god, okay, I just did
a spell for you to hear me.</i>

248
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,591
<i>That's freaking crazy. Okay,
on my end, it's working.</i>

249
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,510
<i>You probably just, like, need to
strengthen your powers or whatever,</i>

250
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,798
<i>and then, like, we can
get anything we want.</i>

251
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,062
<i>'Na, we're witches.</i>

252
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:07,929
‐ okay, last night I made a spell book.

253
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:10,312
‐ oh, my god. ‐ we can
get anything we want.

254
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:13,099
‐ okay, okay. So with this book...

255
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:16,154
‐ yes. ‐ my power...

256
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,689
Who should we cast the spell upon to?

257
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:22,808
‐ big smelly bush.

258
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:25,023
‐ okay, weakling.

259
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:27,863
‐

260
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,360
‐ no! ‐ Anna!

261
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:30,861
‐ Maya, what are you doing?

262
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:32,952
You might only have a
limited amount of energy.

263
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:34,527
You have to choose carefully.

264
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:35,992
Think about it. ‐ yeah,
but what are you thinking

265
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:37,412
catching it with your bare hands?

266
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,950
‐ I have a invisible energy
glove that repelled it.

267
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:42,874
And it can also pull your
farts out of your butt.

268
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,674
‐ Anna, no, I don't
wanna fart in class!

269
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:47,378
‐ okay, sorry.

270
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:48,758
‐ okay, let's get serious, though.

271
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:50,795
‐ okay.

272
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,629
‐ if we have a limited
amount of magic...

273
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,224
‐ right.

274
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:57,219
‐ what do we want?

275
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:59,722
Think about it. ‐ oh, my god.

276
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:00,734
‐ oh, my god, don't look up, though

277
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:24,709
‐ I really, really, really
wish that I never loved Alex.

278
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:27,087
‐ really?

279
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:30,545
‐ we're on and off all the time,

280
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:32,667
and I‐‐just like my biggest nightmare

281
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:34,844
is ending up like my parents, so...

282
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:37,143
‐ yeah.

283
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:39,887
‐ I'm gonna do "I never
loved him" spell.

284
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:43,229
‐ okay. ‐ oh, my god!

285
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:47,556
And then you could also do a "hex
the asshole" spell for Brandt.

286
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,940
‐ oh, 'cause Brandt's
an asshole for me.

287
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:54,607
Or...

288
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:57,782
I could do a love spell
for me and Brandt.

289
00:13:57,782 --> 00:13:59,622
Because think about it.

290
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,237
If he was my boyfriend,

291
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:03,334
then no one would be saying the
stuff they're saying to us.

292
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:04,709
‐ mmm.

293
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:06,286
Got it. You're insane.

294
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,751
‐ I'm inthane?

295
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,208
Okay, fine.

296
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:13,341
I'm doing a love spell for me and b.

297
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,259
‐ okay. You have your
spell, I have mine.

298
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:21,181
<i>Okay, we'll need lovage,</i>

299
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,100
<i>Rosemary, rose petal,
Violet, and yarrow.</i>

300
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:30,652
<i>Pluck hairs from your head
and hairs from your lover.</i>

301
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:32,528
<i>Twist them together.</i>

302
00:14:35,695 --> 00:14:37,405
<i>Melt your ex‐lover's cloth.</i>

303
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:45,815
<i>A lover's lace tied in a devil's knot.</i>

304
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:53,238
<i>The fingernails of a weak virgin.</i>

305
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,451
Psst!

306
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:57,661
Can I clip your nails?

307
00:14:57,662 --> 00:15:00,922
‐ No.

308
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,760
‐ does vendy wiccany say anything

309
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,506
about needing a Brandt doll?

310
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:13,218
<i>A what‐‐ uh... No.</i>

311
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:28,988
‐ Yes, of course.

312
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:31,195
Just a touch.

313
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:37,034
Brandt, stop!

314
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:39,624
Stop! Ugh.

315
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:43,624
We haven't had friends over in a while.

316
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,749
Isn't this nice?

317
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,340
You couldn't help but
come over, could you?

318
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:41,471
Vichaliani potroachi louder‐o‐‐

319
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:43,944
mm... I don't know.

320
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:46,015
Is this crazy?

321
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,270
Probably.

322
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:52,322
It's not like I've fallen out of love
with you in just a couple of weeks.

323
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:54,818
We fight, you know?

324
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,860
We're fiery.

325
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:58,874
‐

326
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:05,584
Yes.

327
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:10,091
Yeeeessss!

328
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:15,511
Maya, the sun is at 176 degrees north.

329
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:18,468
‐ okay, it's almost high noon. It
won't work if we don't do it now.

330
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,139
‐ yeah, I know what it means.
‐ we gotta go.

331
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:22,847
‐ I know.

332
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:24,768
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

333
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:26,137
Hmm.

334
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:28,063
Get ready, she's here. ‐ okay.

335
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:29,812
She is? ‐ she's here.

336
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,530
Vendy Rochelle wiccany.

- She's here.

00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,850
Bring my love Brandt and his fedora,

349
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,444
for my lover's soul cloth.

350
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,979
For the lover who betrayed you,

351
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:14,612
his cloth for the lover
who betrayed you.

352
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:16,239
His cloth for the lover
who betrayed you,

His cloth.

355
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:21,952
Stay out, weaklings.

356
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:23,579
- Just keep going.
- Stay out!

357
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,326
‐ what are you doing? ‐
you're not allowed in there.

358
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:27,038
‐ I'm gonna hex you.

363
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:36,882
Shilaylay pumpano!

00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,381
Shilaylay pumpano! ‐
ah‐ah‐ah‐ah‐ah‐ah‐ah‐‐

365
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:41,092
someone's getting the principal.

All of you, leave! ‐ aah! Aah!

367

369
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:52,435
Aah!

370
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:54,818
Shilaylay pumpano,

371
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:57,315
shilaylay pumpano, shilaylay pumpano,

372
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,238
shilaylay pumpano‐‐ I can't stop!

373
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:01,276
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

374
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,450
Shilaylay pumpano!

375
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,410
‐ it's okay.

376
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,911
‐ Girls.

377
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:11,214
My office.

378
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,327
Anna, you can show Maya the way.

379
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:14,794
‐ right now, or...

380
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:30,182
‐ oh, my god, 'na, don't look up.

381
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:31,694
Look.

382
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:33,556
Did the anti‐love spell work?

383
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:50,963
‐ Oh, my god.

384
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,415
It worked a little.

385
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:54,705
‐ really? ‐ I love him less.

386
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:56,589
‐ really?

387
00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:59,382
Oh...

388
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:03,844
‐ it still hurts.

389
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:09,719
What?

390
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:11,814
Stop. ‐ Brandt is behind you.

391
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,769
‐ no, he isn't.

392
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:16,519
No, he isn't. ‐ he is.

393
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:18,902
I could feel him. ‐ well,
then I have to turn

394
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,439
so he can't see.

395
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:33,211
It worked. He's following me.

396
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:34,745
Oh, my god, it worked.
‐ yeah, yeah, yeah.

397
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:36,629
‐ Okay.

398
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,245
‐ cuckoo, cuckoo!

399
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:40,422
‐ shalaylay pumpano.
‐ shalaylay pumpano.

400
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:42,131
Good‐bye. ‐ I'm gonna go‐‐stop.

401
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:43,591
‐ oh...

402
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:55,102
‐ hey, whazzup?

403
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,943
I like your hair.

404
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:03,531
‐ are you serious?

405
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:08,907
Look, just get away from me, okay?

406
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:10,618
I don't like you.

407
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:12,078
You're ugly.

408
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:16,419
Stop putting your hair in my locker.

409
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:18,415
And stop talking to me.

410
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,287
I don't fucking like you.

411
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:42,396
<i>I know, but it was just pretend.</i>

412
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,989
It's like... It's not a big deal.

413
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:49,196
‐ your principal said that Maya was
putting her hair in Brandt's locker,

414
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:52,278
and you knew about it, and that
doesn't sound like pretend to me.

415
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:56,751
‐ was it doll hair, hmm?

416
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,919
What's goin' on with you?

417
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:06,341
‐ I really don't think this
sharing of the house is working.

418
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,800
I think it's making it worse.

419
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,640
I mean, I know we're
trying to be a family...

420
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:12,635
That's not what we're talking about.
No‐‐don't tell me

421
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:14,218
what we're talking about.

422
00:22:14,223 --> 00:22:16,853
I wanna know what you think.
Tell us what you think.

423
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:22,059
‐ um, I think that you guys
should just stay married.

424
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:23,734
See? She's confused.

425
00:22:23,732 --> 00:22:26,442
What we're doing, this whole
thing is just too hard on her.

426
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:28,903
I told you, one of us should
have moved out. I told you this.

427
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:31,914
We weren't gonna do that. ‐
but you just slept with him.

428
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:36,164
‐ excuse me? ‐ Anna.

429
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:39,121
‐ last night, like didn't you‐‐
I heard you go into her room.

430
00:22:39,123 --> 00:22:40,333
Didn't you not‐‐

431
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:43,132
I mean, do you just sleep with anybody?

432
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:46,707
Are you in love with‐‐ are
you in love with my dad?

433
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,513
Are you just a Monica?

434
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:52,259
‐ a Monica?

435
00:22:52,261 --> 00:22:54,851
‐ Lewinsky.

436
00:22:57,266 --> 00:23:00,266
‐ spying... Is not okay.

437
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:03,312
Curtis, this is not working.

438
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:05,074
Someone's moving out.

439
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:08,685
‐ I'm sorry, mom.

440
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:13,373
‐ she's right.

441
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:14,825
It's not working.

442
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,155
‐ dad.

443
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,541
No!

444
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:22,328
You guys, I'm fine!

445
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,093
I'm sorry, I'm just hormonal!

446
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:30,717
You guys.

447
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:32,546
Fine!

448
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:38,603
No slamming doors in this house!

449
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,639
‐ I'm sorry!

450
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:45,772
‐ the fuck is your problem?

451
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:48,033
‐ oh... Nothing, it's just like

452
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,685
everyone's ruining my life right now.

453
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:53,914
Even Brandt doesn't love me. ‐ I
don't wanna hear about Brandt.

454
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:58,619
Fucking burning hair?

455
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:01,209
You're such a brat.

456
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:03,495
‐ well, it's hard for me too.

457
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,379
‐ shut up. ‐ you don't know.
It's hard for me too!

458
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:08,127
‐ shut up, you idiot.

459
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:11,842
You should just go away.

460
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:19,891
‐

461
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,371
<i>Hello? Maya?</i>

462
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:43,748
‐ Anna... I think that
everyone hates me right now.

463
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:45,327
<i>Me too.</i>

464
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:47,672
<i>That's why I found a
spell to disappear.</i>

465
00:24:47,668 --> 00:24:48,938
<i>Meet me at our spot, kay?</i>

466
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,440
‐ what do you mean, disappear?

467
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:54,742
<i>Someone's gonna move
out and it's my fault.</i>

468
00:24:54,737 --> 00:24:57,157
<i>We'll do it together.</i>

469
00:24:57,157 --> 00:24:59,117
<i>I'll see you soon. Bye.</i>

470
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:01,866
‐ Anna?

471
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,200
Anna?

472
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,470
Bye.

473
00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:34,487

‐ hey.

476
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:43,703
‐ I think someone was following me.

477
00:25:43,703 --> 00:25:46,833
‐ oh, I sent an owl to make
sure that you got here safe.

478
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:49,499
‐ oh, thanks.

479
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:52,748
Are you okay?

480
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:57,047
‐ join me. I'm just in
the middle of spelling.

481
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:02,641
The knife's right there.

482
00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:07,814
Very slowly. ‐ c‐c‐cut my hand.

‐ shh...

486
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:26,655
Okay, I'm ready.

487

Okay. Ha.

498
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:12,171
What?

499
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:19,384
‐ oh, my god.

500

Oh, my god, I feel it in my arms.

503

happening right now.

504

‐ I'm not trying to. ‐ stop!

506
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,490
‐ it's happening. Do
you see my fingers?

507
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,487
They're like leaving me.

508
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:45,949
But the pain's going
away, too, actually.

509
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,990
