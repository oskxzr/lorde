WEBVTT

00:06.965 --> 00:09.175
‐ day of the show! Are you excited?

00:09.176 --> 00:11.136
Um, yeah, I guess I will be

00:11.136 --> 00:13.346
if it's not a total disaster
'cause nobody's prepped,

00:13.347 --> 00:14.887
especially Maya, so‐‐
you know what, though?

00:14.890 --> 00:16.640
I don't want to talk about it,
'cause it's stressing me out.

00:16.642 --> 00:17.852
Dad, we're late!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.021
- Wait, munch.
- Yeah!

00:19.019 --> 00:21.149
Anna, here. Here's your glitter.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.516
‐ okay, so I said that I
didn't want that already, so‐‐

00:23.524 --> 00:26.654
‐ but this is to remind
you that you sparkle.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.322
‐ okay, cool. Whatever. Thank you!

00:29.321 --> 00:31.701
- Dad!
- Coming.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.408
Coming, goof.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.488
‐ so, um... Shoulders back.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.794
Break a leg. I love you.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.118
Give me a hug.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.582
‐ you know what?

00:40.582 --> 00:41.882
I don't want a hug. I'm late.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.335
‐ you look beautiful, sweetie.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.818
Debra.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.030
Divorce.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.620
Wolves.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.236
Or what, Debra?

01:16.243 --> 01:17.453
You gonna divorce me?

01:17.452 --> 01:19.872
You gonna feed me to the wolves?

01:20.872 --> 01:22.082
No.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.882
Wol‐‐

01:23.875 --> 01:25.415
come in.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.129
‐ hey, there you are.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.419
Just wanted to say, break a leg.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.262
‐ oh. Um, thank you.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.877
Uh, you too.

01:31.883 --> 01:35.103
‐ uh, p. S., you should totally
keep your hair like that.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.755
It looks really cool.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.925
‐ thanks.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.332
‐ phone, phone, phone, phone, phone.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.486
Pound, pound, pound, pound, pound.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.794
Okay, you guys. Five minutes.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.998
‐ I saw you.

02:02.998 --> 02:05.208
I saw you with my own two eyes.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.048
You were backing away. Backing away.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.665
Were you doing your
business with Sheila?

02:09.671 --> 02:11.881
You rat bastard. Rat bastard.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.342
- ‐ where's my hat?
- Okay, places in five.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.971
Hey. ‐ hey.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.101
‐ umm, I didn't hear
from you last night.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.138
‐ can't hear you. I
have my headphones on.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.062
‐ I didn't hear from you last night.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.561
‐ I didn't hear from you either.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.362
Um, if you don't find your light,

02:27.356 --> 02:29.146
the whole thing's gonna go wacko, so...

02:29.149 --> 02:30.189
‐ okay, do you know how many lines

02:30.192 --> 02:31.362
I have to remember right now?

02:31.360 --> 02:34.320
‐ 422. Congratulations.
Find your light.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.701
‐ the light will find me, Anna.
Like, seriously.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.158
Honestly, all you have to do right now

02:38.158 --> 02:39.448
is just, like, pep me up.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.411
Like, pep me up. Just
say, like, "break a leg."

02:41.411 --> 02:43.211
Whatever. What‐‐you haven't
said that once to me.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.665
- ‐ your feelings are valid.
- Mm‐hmm.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.915
- ‐ so are mine.
- Mm‐hmm.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.876
‐ and you can't take
constructive criticism.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.666
That's my feeling. ‐ are you kidding?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.630
- ‐ and good luck.
- Okay, you just jinxed me.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.840
It's "break a leg," so now I'm gonna

02:52.839 --> 02:54.299
be really bad in the
play, but it's fine.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.259
Let's just hold each other's
hand and say, "I'm sorry."

02:57.386 --> 02:58.636
‐ I'm not ready right now.

02:58.637 --> 02:59.757
‐ well, I'm not really
ready for it either.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.063
I was honestly just saying it

03:01.056 --> 03:02.516
'cause I thought it was
the right thing to do.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.059
So... ‐ wow.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.310
Places in 4 minutes, 15 seconds.
‐ okay.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.534
Psycho.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.609
Yep.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.905
‐ hi.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.789
‐ are you still feeling sick?

03:22.786 --> 03:25.286
‐ no, I'm just, uh, concentrating.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.998
‐ kay, well, I'm really looking forward

03:27.999 --> 03:31.169
to 4 minutes and 32
seconds into the play.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.587
It's our kiss.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.629
‐ oh...

03:36.633 --> 03:37.633
Yeah.

03:38.510 --> 03:42.060
‐ kay, well... Break a leg, cutie.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.055
You too...

03:44.099 --> 03:45.809
Cutie. ‐ kay.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.229
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.610
<i>Actors, places. Actors to places.</i>

03:59.531 --> 04:00.991
‐

04:00.991 --> 04:02.581
‐ shut up!

04:18.258 --> 04:19.468
‐

04:22.053 --> 04:23.053
I saw you!

04:24.598 --> 04:26.728
I saw you with my own two eyes!

04:26.725 --> 04:28.685
You're nuts.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.855
‐ Sheila was backing away from you.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.975
She was scared out of her mind.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.897
‐ she's not in her light.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.783
<i>She's not in her light.</i> ‐

04:43.658 --> 04:45.868
she was scared out of her mind.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.579
Honey, help me with this, will you?

04:47.579 --> 04:49.079
It's giving me a rash.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.290
‐ a rash, a rash. Always
something with you.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.381
‐ Bryce, are you there?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.585
Be careful with it. ‐ go to two.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.955
- Go to two.
- Careful with it, I said.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.461
Jesus Christ! ‐ all
right, relax, will you?

04:56.463 --> 04:58.343
You're wriggling around like a worm,

04:58.340 --> 05:00.630
and you're hairier than a bigfoot.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.724
‐

05:04.554 --> 05:07.894
Your fingers are greasy
schlubs, that's why.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.391
Forget it, will you?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.233
I said just get it‐‐off!

05:12.229 --> 05:13.809
- Jesus Christ.
- All right.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.188
Jesus Christ, I said. Jesus Christ.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.533
- ‐ cue 30.
- What do you want?

05:19.528 --> 05:20.858
- Want me to stay?
<i>- Cue 30.</i>

05:20.862 --> 05:22.862
Want me to go? Make
up your mind, woman!

05:23.657 --> 05:24.657
Make up your mind.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.872
‐ no, that's cue 22.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.912
Yeah.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.464
Too damn dark in this joint.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.461
Don't you dare make another drink.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.423
I'm telling you, don't you do it!

05:40.423 --> 05:41.763
‐ or what, Debra?

05:41.758 --> 05:43.178
You gonna divorce me?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.006
You gonna feed me to the wolves?

05:45.011 --> 05:47.141
I don't have to listen
to your loud‐mouth crap.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.058
Just let me do my business. ‐ yeah?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.440
Were you doing your
business with Sheila?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.145
You rat bastard.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.321
‐ you wanna do this? Let's do this.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.856
Let's let it all out. ‐ go light.
Go light.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.030
Come on, baby.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.197
- ‐ shit.
- Give me your best shot.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.985
‐ you get away from me.

06:03.989 --> 06:07.659
‐ isn't this... What you want?

06:07.659 --> 06:10.079
‐ you don't know the first
thing about what I want!

06:10.078 --> 06:12.078
You get your hands off me, you pig!

06:12.080 --> 06:15.330
‐

06:15.333 --> 06:17.133
Or what?

06:42.193 --> 06:43.783
‐ Come on, Maya.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.658

Or...

07:08.219 --> 07:10.349
Or...

07:21.358 --> 07:22.358
‐

07:26.363 --> 07:29.953
‐ "or I'll scream so..."

07:37.499 --> 07:41.539
‐ or I'll scream so loud,
you won't know what hit ya!

07:42.462 --> 07:44.842
Whoo!

07:44.839 --> 07:46.879
‐ yeah, yeah. Just...

07:46.883 --> 07:48.183
Go to sleep.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.561
‐ I already am, Joe.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.305
I already am.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.204
Sun's almost up.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.075
‐ the days are short, Joe.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.156
The days are short.

11:12.585 --> 11:16.215
- Ready, star?
- Let's do this.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.337
Maya, shut the door, please.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.474
‐ you get it.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.973
I mean, they're gonna swarm us.

- ‐ well done.
- Wasn't she great?

13:07.495 --> 13:10.245
I‐‐I was wondering the same thing.

13:11.582 --> 13:15.252
So that glitter I gave you...

13:15.253 --> 13:16.923
‐ yeah, I used it.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.011
It was an emergency, so...

13:19.007 --> 13:20.627
‐ it was a nice touch.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.973
You probably saved the
whole thing, huh?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.467
‐ mom, are you out of your mind?

13:26.472 --> 13:27.852
Don't do that.

‐ oh, my god, my dad is being
so annoying and so loud.

so nice to meet you.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.382
‐ yeah, it's good to
officially meet you.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.880
You know, she talked about you
about rehearsals and everything.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.092
‐ no, I didn't. ‐ well, you did.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.591
Stop. You're literally killing me.

‐ okay, okay. Hey, listen.
I want a picture of you.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.596
I want a picture of the
both of you; Come on.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.266
The stars of the show. Right
here, come on, together.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.135
All right? A little closer.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.192
- ‐ dad, stop.
- Yeah, that's good.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.305
All right, you ready?

14:13.311 --> 14:14.851
One, two, three, grandkids!

14:14.854 --> 14:16.864
‐ dad, don't say that. Like‐‐

14:16.856 --> 14:18.016
‐ all right, all right, all right.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.484
He's so embarrassing. I'm sorry.

14:19.484 --> 14:20.494
‐

14:20.485 --> 14:22.315
‐ sorry.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.737
Your hair looks different.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.031
It's hot.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.078
‐ thanks.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.420
You too. Your‐‐your hair is hot.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.575
‐ thanks.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.794
‐ welcome.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.344
‐ Um...

14:39.337 --> 14:42.127
I didn't see you after the play.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.381
‐ yeah.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.307
‐ okay.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.425
Hey, are you guys hungry?

14:50.431 --> 14:51.601
Would you like some groovy nachos?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.389
‐ dad, don't say "groovy nachos"!

14:53.392 --> 14:55.652
‐ oh, I'd like an order
of groovy nachos too.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.015
Two orders of groovy nachos,

14:57.021 --> 14:58.311
and I want a coke

14:58.314 --> 14:59.864
for that table over there
for that young man.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.357
‐ dad, don't, or I'll stick
an ice pick up your butthole!

15:02.360 --> 15:03.650
Stop!

15:03.653 --> 15:05.403
- Oh, no, you okay, hon'?
- No.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.864
What's wrong?

15:06.864 --> 15:08.204
‐ close it. ‐ what? Okay.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.699
‐ close it! ‐ I'll‐‐I'll
keep it closed.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.330
‐ hold it. ‐ what's wrong, girl?
You okay?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.497
‐ yeah, I'm fine, I just, like,

15:13.496 --> 15:15.456
I was out there with
Gabe, and I just, like,

15:15.456 --> 15:16.786
tried to grab his hand
like this, and he went‐‐

15:16.791 --> 15:18.791
‐ that's so cute. ‐ no,
and he went like that.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.343
‐ maybe his hand slipped.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.456
‐ no, but then when we were onstage,

15:21.462 --> 15:22.632
we were planning to do a real kiss,

15:22.630 --> 15:23.670
and he put his hand over his mouth,

15:23.673 --> 15:25.133
like, at the last second.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.223
‐ it's okay. Hey, I'm sorry‐‐sorry.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.507
‐ stop, we're in here!

15:27.510 --> 15:28.510
‐ just two more seconds.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.011
‐ is it my breath?

15:31.013 --> 15:33.643
‐ lt's good.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.139
No, no, really‐‐ ‐ oh, my god!

15:36.144 --> 15:37.854
‐ no, no, no, no. No, it's good.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.274
And do you know‐‐ can
I ask you a question?

15:39.272 --> 15:42.362
Were you nervous out
there, for your kiss?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.778
‐ I mean, yeah, 'cause it's,
like, in front of everyone,

15:44.777 --> 15:46.237
and like, it's my first kiss.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.357
‐ so he was probably nervous too.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.744
I think that you just
gotta do it again,

15:50.741 --> 15:52.161
and you gotta go for what you want,

15:52.160 --> 15:53.490
and it's gonna happen.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.163
‐ okay, yeah. Yeah, all right.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.544
Fine. I'm just gonna‐‐

15:57.540 --> 15:58.920
‐ I see how he looks at you.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.126
‐ stop. ‐ it's true.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.626
‐ okay. All right, fine.
‐ let's do this.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.587
‐ okay, but be quiet.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.128
I don't want to be obvious about it.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.802
Okay, just like, literally
don't look, and like, if‐‐

16:13.055 --> 16:15.095
‐ hey.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.639
‐ oh, my god, my dad's here.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.812
I'm gonna say hi. ‐ oh, my god, really?

16:19.061 --> 16:22.111
Okay, I'll be there in a sex‐‐ sec.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.110
‐ what's up?

16:28.279 --> 16:29.609
‐ you always say that.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.324
‐ yeah.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.704
True.

16:35.411 --> 16:39.081
Um... ‐ so...

16:39.081 --> 16:41.211
‐ yeah.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.379
‐ what? ‐ I just, you know...

16:43.377 --> 16:49.677
Wanted to say that, uh, you know...

16:49.675 --> 16:51.175
‐ what?

16:51.177 --> 16:54.887
‐ you were‐‐you‐‐I‐‐you were
just really good in the play.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.845
‐ no, I wasn't.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.270
‐ no, yes, you were, seriously. ‐ no.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.348
‐ I knew you were funny, but...

17:01.354 --> 17:03.364
I've never seen you like that before.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.476
- You're really...
- Good.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.571
‐ thanks.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.243
‐ and...

17:12.240 --> 17:14.780
I‐‐I also wanted to

17:14.784 --> 17:19.664
once and for all or
whatever, that, uh...

17:19.664 --> 17:21.874
Never mind.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.964
‐ no. Say it.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.840
Fool.

17:25.836 --> 17:29.376
‐ I'm‐‐I'm really sorry
about everything.

17:31.801 --> 17:35.431
I‐‐I wish I didn't do all that stuff.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.225
Fool.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.308
‐ what are you even doing here?

17:45.314 --> 17:47.024
I'm, you know‐‐I'm with Gabe.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.404
We're celebrating. ‐ oh, yeah.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.401
Yeah.

- Um...

17:56.993 --> 18:00.913
What was‐‐what was up with
that kiss in the play?

18:00.913 --> 18:03.043
‐ I don't know. Why?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.380
‐ no reason. Nothing. ‐ why?
Did he say something?

18:05.376 --> 18:06.836
‐ no.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.876
Um, but I mean, you know,

18:08.879 --> 18:11.419
I wouldn't have put my
hand over my mouth.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.891
‐

18:14.885 --> 18:17.715
‐ so you know, I guess I
should've auditioned.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.062
So‐‐or something.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.596
‐ I don't know. Maybe.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.270
‐ yeah. ‐ I guess you should've.

Yeah. ‐ or not. I don't know.

‐ bye.

18:37.820 --> 18:39.540
‐ so‐‐well, how was it?

18:39.535 --> 18:40.535
How was the play?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.616
‐ it was... Good.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.082
It was bumpy at first,

18:44.081 --> 18:48.211
and then it got...
Better, but pretty good.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.300
‐ Anna made such an impact
as the stage manager,

18:51.297 --> 18:52.547
and there was point whe‐‐
‐ yeah, that's great.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.968
Hey.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.966

flowers that we got you?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.258
‐ yes. ‐

18:57.261 --> 18:58.801
‐ thank you so much. ‐ absolutely.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.814
‐ they're so pretty. Where
did you guys get them?

19:00.806 --> 19:03.176
‐ uh, where did we get
the flowers, Kathy?

19:03.184 --> 19:05.234
‐ I got them from stop and shop.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.807
Really? ‐ yes.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.982
‐ you know, there are much
better places to get flowers

19:08.981 --> 19:10.191
than stop and shop.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.901
Right?

19:11.901 --> 19:13.281
Hey, did your mom clap,

19:13.277 --> 19:16.777
or did she do that weird
yodeling thing that she does?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.321
‐ she did the weird yodel thing.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.784
It was so embarrassing.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.414
Honestly.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.620
Mm‐hmm. ‐ where were you?

19:23.621 --> 19:26.421
‐ you want to know? You ready?

19:30.544 --> 19:31.804
‐ did you get a new car?

19:31.796 --> 19:33.626
‐ New!

19:33.631 --> 19:35.171
- Used.
- What kind?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.224
It's a solara.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.637
It's right out back.

19:37.635 --> 19:38.635
- ‐ excuse me.
- It's really cool.

19:38.636 --> 19:39.636
You're gonna love it.

19:39.637 --> 19:40.717
‐ so that's where you were.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.061
Uh‐huh. ‐ that's great.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.516
‐ it's a convertible too.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.266
Oh, my god, curt, you got
a frickin' convertible?

19:45.267 --> 19:47.397
Yep, I got a convertible.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.395
- Can we go in it?
- Absolutely.

19:49.397 --> 19:53.277
Oh, my god. ‐ just don't

Um, I love your earring,
by the way, curt.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.157
‐ you know, I've always had the hole.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.712
I just got a new hoop.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.045
Oh, my god, your dad is crazy.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.795
So I did this weasel.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.087
Here, I did the gloves. I
also did the barbed wire.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.881
‐ wait, wait. You did all of this?

20:18.884 --> 20:20.684
‐ yeah, last night I went to kinkos.

Um, Anna's dad got a new convertible,

20:38.237 --> 20:39.357
The only thing‐‐ sorry, you guys.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.993
There's only room for one,

20:40.990 --> 20:42.870

20:42.867 --> 20:45.997

21:04.096 --> 21:06.806
Shut up!

Oh, my god!

21:14.190 --> 21:15.190
It's pretty sleek.

Does your dad know that he can get

21:51.894 --> 21:54.274
the upgrade to the sports package?

21:54.271 --> 21:57.401
These are pretty sweet, though.
He's got the jbl stereo.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.529
‐ yeah.

21:59.527 --> 22:00.947
‐ so many stars.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.838
leave them alone.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.588
Stop. ‐ you guys need to get a room.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.669
Anna!

22:21.674 --> 22:23.384
‐ don't get my dad's seats dirty.

22:23.384 --> 22:24.684
‐ that's disgusting.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.137
‐ or do, and just wipe it down after.

‐ mom did.

22:46.740 --> 22:50.490
She, uh‐‐she loved the
glitter thing, by the way.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.294
I told her that wasn't me.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.708
That was all kone.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.837
"Cameron‐esque" was my exact phrase.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.495
As in, James.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.463
‐ Yeah.

Um, are you close with your mom?

23:09.471 --> 23:10.891
‐ and your dad?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.600

They're divorced.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.479
‐ mine are too.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.189
