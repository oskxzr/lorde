1
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,175
‐ day of the show! Are you excited?

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,136
Um, yeah, I guess I will be

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,346
if it's not a total disaster
'cause nobody's prepped,

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,887
especially Maya, so‐‐
you know what, though?

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,640
I don't want to talk about it,
'cause it's stressing me out.

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,852
Dad, we're late!

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,021
- Wait, munch.
- Yeah!

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,149
Anna, here. Here's your glitter.

9
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,516
‐ okay, so I said that I
didn't want that already, so‐‐

10
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,654
‐ but this is to remind
you that you sparkle.

11
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,322
‐ okay, cool. Whatever. Thank you!

12
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,701
- Dad!
- Coming.

13
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,408
Coming, goof.

14
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,488
‐ so, um... Shoulders back.

15
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,794
Break a leg. I love you.

16
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,118
Give me a hug.

17
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,582
‐ you know what?

18
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,882
I don't want a hug. I'm late.

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,335
‐ you look beautiful, sweetie.

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,818
Debra.

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,030
Divorce.

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,620
Wolves.

23
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,236
Or what, Debra?

24
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,453
You gonna divorce me?

25
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,872
You gonna feed me to the wolves?

26
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,082
No.

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,882
Wol‐‐

28
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,415
come in.

29
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,129
‐ hey, there you are.

30
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,419
Just wanted to say, break a leg.

31
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,262
‐ oh. Um, thank you.

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,877
Uh, you too.

33
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,103
‐ uh, p. S., you should totally
keep your hair like that.

34
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,755
It looks really cool.

35
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,925
‐ thanks.

36
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,332
‐ phone, phone, phone, phone, phone.

37
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,486
Pound, pound, pound, pound, pound.

38
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,794
Okay, you guys. Five minutes.

39
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,998
‐ I saw you.

40
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,208
I saw you with my own two eyes.

41
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,048
You were backing away. Backing away.

42
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,665
Were you doing your
business with Sheila?

43
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,881
You rat bastard. Rat bastard.

44
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,342
- ‐ where's my hat?
- Okay, places in five.

45
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,971
Hey. ‐ hey.

46
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,101
‐ umm, I didn't hear
from you last night.

47
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,138
‐ can't hear you. I
have my headphones on.

48
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,062
‐ I didn't hear from you last night.

49
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,561
‐ I didn't hear from you either.

50
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,362
Um, if you don't find your light,

51
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,146
the whole thing's gonna go wacko, so...

52
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,189
‐ okay, do you know how many lines

53
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,362
I have to remember right now?

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,320
‐ 422. Congratulations.
Find your light.

55
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,701
‐ the light will find me, Anna.
Like, seriously.

56
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,158
Honestly, all you have to do right now

57
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,448
is just, like, pep me up.

58
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,411
Like, pep me up. Just
say, like, "break a leg."

59
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,211
Whatever. What‐‐you haven't
said that once to me.

60
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,665
- ‐ your feelings are valid.
- Mm‐hmm.

61
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,915
- ‐ so are mine.
- Mm‐hmm.

62
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,876
‐ and you can't take
constructive criticism.

63
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,666
That's my feeling. ‐ are you kidding?

64
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,630
- ‐ and good luck.
- Okay, you just jinxed me.

65
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,840
It's "break a leg," so now I'm gonna

66
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,299
be really bad in the
play, but it's fine.

67
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,259
Let's just hold each other's
hand and say, "I'm sorry."

68
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,636
‐ I'm not ready right now.

69
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,757
‐ well, I'm not really
ready for it either.

70
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,063
I was honestly just saying it

71
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,516
'cause I thought it was
the right thing to do.

72
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,059
So... ‐ wow.

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,310
Places in 4 minutes, 15 seconds.
‐ okay.

74
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,534
Psycho.

75
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,609
Yep.

76
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,905
‐ hi.

77
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,789
‐ are you still feeling sick?

78
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,286
‐ no, I'm just, uh, concentrating.

79
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,998
‐ kay, well, I'm really looking forward

80
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,169
to 4 minutes and 32
seconds into the play.

81
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,587
It's our kiss.

82
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,629
‐ oh...

83
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,633
Yeah.

84
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,060
‐ kay, well... Break a leg, cutie.

85
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,055
You too...

86
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,809
Cutie. ‐ kay.

87
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,229
- Bye.
- Bye.

88
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,610
<i>Actors, places. Actors to places.</i>

89
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,991
‐

90
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,581
‐ shut up!

91
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,468
‐

92
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,053
I saw you!

93
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,728
I saw you with my own two eyes!

94
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,685
You're nuts.

95
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,855
‐ Sheila was backing away from you.

96
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,975
She was scared out of her mind.

97
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,897
‐ she's not in her light.

98
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,783
<i>She's not in her light.</i> ‐

99
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,868
she was scared out of her mind.

100
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,579
Honey, help me with this, will you?

101
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,079
It's giving me a rash.

102
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,290
‐ a rash, a rash. Always
something with you.

103
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,381
‐ Bryce, are you there?

104
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,585
Be careful with it. ‐ go to two.

105
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,955
- Go to two.
- Careful with it, I said.

106
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,461
Jesus Christ! ‐ all
right, relax, will you?

107
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,343
You're wriggling around like a worm,

108
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,630
and you're hairier than a bigfoot.

109
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,724
‐

110
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,894
Your fingers are greasy
schlubs, that's why.

111
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,391
Forget it, will you?

112
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,233
I said just get it‐‐off!

113
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,809
- Jesus Christ.
- All right.

114
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,188
Jesus Christ, I said. Jesus Christ.

115
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,533
- ‐ cue 30.
- What do you want?

116
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,858
- Want me to stay?
<i>- Cue 30.</i>

117
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,862
Want me to go? Make
up your mind, woman!

118
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,657
Make up your mind.

119
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,872
‐ no, that's cue 22.

120
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,912
Yeah.

121
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,464
Too damn dark in this joint.

122
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,461
Don't you dare make another drink.

123
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,423
I'm telling you, don't you do it!

124
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,763
‐ or what, Debra?

125
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,178
You gonna divorce me?

126
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,006
You gonna feed me to the wolves?

127
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,141
I don't have to listen
to your loud‐mouth crap.

128
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,058
Just let me do my business. ‐ yeah?

129
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,440
Were you doing your
business with Sheila?

130
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,145
You rat bastard.

131
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,321
‐ you wanna do this? Let's do this.

132
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,856
Let's let it all out. ‐ go light.
Go light.

133
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,030
Come on, baby.

134
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,197
- ‐ shit.
- Give me your best shot.

135
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,985
‐ you get away from me.

136
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,659
‐ isn't this... What you want?

137
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,079
‐ you don't know the first
thing about what I want!

138
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,078
You get your hands off me, you pig!

139
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,330
‐

140
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,133
Or what?

141
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,783

‐ "or I'll scream so..."

150
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,539
‐ or I'll scream so loud,
you won't know what hit ya!

00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,842
Whoo!

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,150
‐ I was about to pet him.

184
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,652
♪ As I recall it ended much too soon ♪

185
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,244
Oh, sorry.

186
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,320
That guy is looking‐‐

187
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,334
oh, there they are!

188
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,525
All right!

189
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,744
No. No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Stay.

190
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,084
Dad, no! ‐ no, please.

191
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,789
I‐‐I gotta turn this on.

192
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,579
All right, smile.

193
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,132
Come on. One, two, three, smile.

194
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,295
‐ dad! You're gonna, like, blind me.

195
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,877
You were amazing! Come on.

196
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,052
You have to get used to getting
pictures taken all the time

197
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,431
'cause you're a star. ‐ no, I'm not.

198
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,007
‐ that was dope, young bowl.

199
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,062
‐ thank you. Really? ‐ mm‐hmm.

200
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,596
‐ so what, now you're a star,

201
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,809
you don't bring your own jacket?

202
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,729
‐ no, I'm not a star. I'm an actress.

203
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,057
I forgot it.

204
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,692
- ‐ well done.
- Wasn't she great?

205
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,149
She was so good tonight. I know‐‐

206
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,858
- ‐ dad, stop, seriously.
- I'm her father.

207
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,818
You were amazing tonight, angel,

208
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,699
and these are for you
from me and your dad.

209
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,197
‐ techies don't get flowers.

210
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,118
Like... But thanks.

211
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,198
Where's dad?

212
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,502
‐ um, I don't know, sweetie.

213
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,245
I‐‐I was wondering the same thing.

214
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,252
So that glitter I gave you...

215
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,923
‐ yeah, I used it.

216
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,011
It was an emergency, so...

217
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,627
‐ it was a nice touch.

218
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,973
You probably saved the
whole thing, huh?

219
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,467
‐ mom, are you out of your mind?

220
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,852
Don't do that.

221
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,099
‐ oh, my god, my dad is being
so annoying and so loud.

222
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,271
‐ I don't know what that's like.

223
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,399
‐ ugh.

224
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,395
‐ oh, my god, it's your boyfriend.

225
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,204
Oh, there he is! The man of the house.

226
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,753
Gabe, you were great tonight.

227
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,077
‐ dad, stop. ‐ ow!

228
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,251
‐ Maya, stop it.

229
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,499
‐ see you guys.

230
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,040
Uh, hi. We're‐‐we're her parents.

231
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,714
‐ yeah, that's Gabe. ‐
so nice to meet you.

232
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,382
‐ yeah, it's good to
officially meet you.

233
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,880
You know, she talked about you
about rehearsals and everything.

234
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,092
‐ no, I didn't. ‐ well, you did.

235
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,591
Stop. You're literally killing me.

236
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,143
‐ okay, okay. Hey, listen.
I want a picture of you.

237
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,596
I want a picture of the
both of you; Come on.

238
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,266
The stars of the show. Right
here, come on, together.

239
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,135
All right? A little closer.

240
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,192
- ‐ dad, stop.
- Yeah, that's good.

241
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,305
All right, you ready?

242
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,851
One, two, three, grandkids!

243
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,864
‐ dad, don't say that. Like‐‐

244
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,016
‐ all right, all right, all right.

245
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,484
He's so embarrassing. I'm sorry.

246
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,494
‐

247
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,315
‐ sorry.

248
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,737
Your hair looks different.

249
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,031
It's hot.

250
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,078
‐ thanks.

251
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,420
You too. Your‐‐your hair is hot.

252
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,575
‐ thanks.

253
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,794
‐ welcome.

254
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,344
‐ Um...

255
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,127
I didn't see you after the play.

256
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,381
‐ yeah.

257
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,307
‐ okay.

258
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,425
Hey, are you guys hungry?

259
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,601
Would you like some groovy nachos?

260
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,389
‐ dad, don't say "groovy nachos"!

261
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,652
‐ oh, I'd like an order
of groovy nachos too.

262
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,015
Two orders of groovy nachos,

263
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,311
and I want a coke

264
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,864
for that table over there
for that young man.

265
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,357
‐ dad, don't, or I'll stick
an ice pick up your butthole!

266
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,650
Stop!

267
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,403
- Oh, no, you okay, hon'?
- No.

268
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,864
What's wrong?

269
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,204
‐ close it. ‐ what? Okay.

270
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,699
‐ close it! ‐ I'll‐‐I'll
keep it closed.

271
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,330
‐ hold it. ‐ what's wrong, girl?
You okay?

272
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,497
‐ yeah, I'm fine, I just, like,

273
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,456
I was out there with
Gabe, and I just, like,

274
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,786
tried to grab his hand
like this, and he went‐‐

275
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,791
‐ that's so cute. ‐ no,
and he went like that.

276
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,343
‐ maybe his hand slipped.

277
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,456
‐ no, but then when we were onstage,

278
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,632
we were planning to do a real kiss,

279
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,670
and he put his hand over his mouth,

280
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,133
like, at the last second.

281
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,223
‐ it's okay. Hey, I'm sorry‐‐sorry.

282
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,507
‐ stop, we're in here!

283
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,510
‐ just two more seconds.

284
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,011
‐ is it my breath?

285
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,643
‐ lt's good.

286
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,139
No, no, really‐‐ ‐ oh, my god!

287
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,854
‐ no, no, no, no. No, it's good.

288
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,274
And do you know‐‐ can
I ask you a question?

289
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,362
Were you nervous out
there, for your kiss?

290
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,778
‐ I mean, yeah, 'cause it's,
like, in front of everyone,

291
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,237
and like, it's my first kiss.

292
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,357
‐ so he was probably nervous too.

293
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,744
I think that you just
gotta do it again,

294
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,161
and you gotta go for what you want,

295
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,490
and it's gonna happen.

296
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,163
‐ okay, yeah. Yeah, all right.

297
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,544
Fine. I'm just gonna‐‐

298
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,920
‐ I see how he looks at you.

299
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,126
‐ stop. ‐ it's true.

300
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,626
‐ okay. All right, fine.
‐ let's do this.

301
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,587
‐ okay, but be quiet.

302
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,128
I don't want to be obvious about it.

303
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,802
Okay, just like, literally
don't look, and like, if‐‐

304
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,095
‐ hey.

305
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,639
‐ oh, my god, my dad's here.

306
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,812
I'm gonna say hi. ‐ oh, my god, really?

307
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,111
Okay, I'll be there in a sex‐‐ sec.

308
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,110
‐ what's up?

309
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,609
‐ you always say that.

310
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,324
‐ yeah.

311
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,704
True.

312
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,081
Um... ‐ so...

313
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,211
‐ yeah.

314
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,379
‐ what? ‐ I just, you know...

315
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:49,677
Wanted to say that, uh, you know...

316
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,175
‐ what?

317
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,887
‐ you were‐‐you‐‐I‐‐you were
just really good in the play.

318
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,845
‐ no, I wasn't.

319
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,270
‐ no, yes, you were, seriously. ‐ no.

320
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,348
‐ I knew you were funny, but...

321
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,364
I've never seen you like that before.

322
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,476
- You're really...
- Good.

323
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,571
‐ thanks.

324
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,243
‐ and...

325
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,780
I‐‐I also wanted to
say, like, you know,

326
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:19,664
once and for all or
whatever, that, uh...

327
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,874
Never mind.

328
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,964
‐ no. Say it.

329
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,840
Fool.

330
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,376
‐ I'm‐‐I'm really sorry
about everything.

331
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,431
I‐‐I wish I didn't do all that stuff.

332
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,225
Fool.

333
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,308
‐ what are you even doing here?

334
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,024
I'm, you know‐‐I'm with Gabe.

335
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,404
We're celebrating. ‐ oh, yeah.

336
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,401
Yeah.

337
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,985
‐ my boyfriend.

338
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,528
- ‐ yes.
- Yeah.

339
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,741
‐ yeah, your boyfriend.

340
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,990
- Yeah.
- Um...

341
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,913
What was‐‐what was up with
that kiss in the play?

342
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,043
‐ I don't know. Why?

343
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,380
‐ no reason. Nothing. ‐ why?
Did he say something?

344
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,836
‐ no.

345
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,876
Um, but I mean, you know,

346
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,419
I wouldn't have put my
hand over my mouth.

347
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,891
‐

348
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,715
‐ so you know, I guess I
should've auditioned.

349
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,062
So‐‐or something.

350
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,596
‐ I don't know. Maybe.

351
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,270
‐ yeah. ‐ I guess you should've.

352
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,019
Yeah. ‐ or not. I don't know.

353
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,651
- Yeah.
- Kay. Bye.

354
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,857
‐ bye.

355
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,540
‐ so‐‐well, how was it?

356
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,535
How was the play?

357
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,616
‐ it was... Good.

358
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,082
It was bumpy at first,

359
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:48,211
and then it got...
Better, but pretty good.

360
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,300
‐ Anna made such an impact
as the stage manager,

361
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,547
and there was point whe‐‐
‐ yeah, that's great.

362
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,968
Hey.

363
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,966
Did, uh, Kathy give you the
flowers that we got you?

364
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,258
‐ yes. ‐

365
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,801
‐ thank you so much. ‐ absolutely.

366
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,814
‐ they're so pretty. Where
did you guys get them?

367
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,176
‐ uh, where did we get
the flowers, Kathy?

368
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,234
‐ I got them from stop and shop.

369
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,807
Really? ‐ yes.

370
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,982
‐ you know, there are much
better places to get flowers

371
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,191
than stop and shop.

372
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,901
Right?

373
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,281
Hey, did your mom clap,

374
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,777
or did she do that weird
yodeling thing that she does?

375
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,321
‐ she did the weird yodel thing.

376
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,784
It was so embarrassing.

377
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,414
Honestly.

378
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,620
Mm‐hmm. ‐ where were you?

379
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,421
‐ you want to know? You ready?

380
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,804
‐ did you get a new car?

381
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,626
‐ New!

382
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,171
- Used.
- What kind?

383
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,224
It's a solara.

384
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,637
It's right out back.

385
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,635
- ‐ excuse me.
- It's really cool.

386
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,636
You're gonna love it.

387
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,717
‐ so that's where you were.

388
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,061
Uh‐huh. ‐ that's great.

389
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,516
‐ it's a convertible too.

390
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,266
Oh, my god, curt, you got
a frickin' convertible?

391
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,397
Yep, I got a convertible.

392
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,395
- Can we go in it?
- Absolutely.

393
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:53,277
Oh, my god. ‐ just don't
drive it too far.

394
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,695
Oh, my god. ‐

395
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,026
‐ oh, my god.

396
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,451
He got a convertible.

397
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,329
Um, I love your earring,
by the way, curt.

398
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,157
‐ you know, I've always had the hole.

399
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,712
I just got a new hoop.

400
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,045
Oh, my god, your dad is crazy.

401
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,795
So I did this weasel.

402
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,087
Here, I did the gloves. I
also did the barbed wire.

403
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,881
‐ wait, wait. You did all of this?

404
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,684
‐ yeah, last night I went to kinkos.

405
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,048
I even got the glossy‐‐
‐ guy‐‐guys, guys.

406
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,474
This is‐‐this is great.

407
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,062
I think we're ready to distribute.

408
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,387
Sorry. Right? That's
what I was thinking.

409
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,732
‐ hey.

410
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,897
Um, Anna's dad got a new convertible,

411
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,356
and we were gonna, like, check it out.

412
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,436
What? He did.

413
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,862
‐ he did. ‐ do you wanna come?

414
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,241
‐ hell yeah. ‐ yeah.

415
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,357
The only thing‐‐ sorry, you guys.

416
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,993
There's only room for one,

417
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,870
so I don't know how to decide,

418
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,997
but I'm thinking Maya's boyfriend...

419
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,785
Stop.

420
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,539
- Sorry.
- That's me, so...

421
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,251
‐ just so they have time to be like...

422
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,592
‐ stop.

423
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,957
‐ all right, I'm‐‐ I'm gonna go.

424
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,343
‐ kay. ‐ don't eat all the pizza.

425
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,550
‐ I won't.

426
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,721
That's some bullshit.

427
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,100
‐ yeah, whatever.

428
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,806
Shut up!

429
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,227
Oh, my god, you guys.

430
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,805
‐ wait, is it this car?

431
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,270
No, it's the convertible.

432
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,190
Oh, my god!

433
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,190
It's pretty sleek.

434
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,361
That's amazing.

435
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,818
That's like my‐‐ Maya: Yeah.

436
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,739
‐ oh, my god. Steve.

437
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:21,858
That's pretty cool.

438
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,494
I'm gonna go in the front seat,

439
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,741
and you can go in the b‐‐ what?

440
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:26,913
Steve. ‐ hey.

441
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,041
‐ Steve.

442
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,208
- What's up?
- 'Sup?

443
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,917
You're here. ‐ try not to tell anyone.

444
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,338
‐ we're just looking at my
dad's, um, convertible.

445
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,508
It's new, so...

446
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,966
‐ you mean that sweet solara?

447
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,585
‐ uh, the convertible? Yeah.

448
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,853
‐ so let's check it out.

449
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,846
‐ kay.

450
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,893
Does your dad know that he can get

451
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,274
the upgrade to the sports package?

452
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,401
These are pretty sweet, though.
He's got the jbl stereo.

453
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,529
‐ yeah.

454
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,947
‐ so many stars.

455
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,105
Yeah. They're all dead.

456
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,167
‐ I think that we need to, like,

457
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,838
leave them alone.

458
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,588
Stop. ‐ you guys need to get a room.

459
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,669
Anna!

460
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,384
‐ don't get my dad's seats dirty.

461
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,684
‐ that's disgusting.

462
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,137
‐ or do, and just wipe it down after.

463
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,676
It's model 3b high‐perforated leather.

464
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,427
‐ yeah. ‐ yeah.

465
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,231
‐ should we go up?

466
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,243
‐ um... Sure. ‐ kay..

467
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,026
‐ so did your parents see the show?

468
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,740
‐ mom did.

469
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,490
She, uh‐‐she loved the
glitter thing, by the way.

470
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,294
I told her that wasn't me.

471
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,708
That was all kone.

472
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,837
"Cameron‐esque" was my exact phrase.

473
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,495
As in, James.

474
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,463
‐ Yeah.

475
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,593
Um, are you close with your mom?

476
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,972
‐ she's the strongest woman I know.

477
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,891
‐ and your dad?

478
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,600
‐ he doesn't live here.

479
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,930
They're divorced.

480
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,479
‐ mine are too.

481
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,189
- ‐ but your dad's here?
- Yeah.

482
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,569
They're divorcing, but they
kind of share the house.

483
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,238
‐ sounds worse than the
"every other weekend" deal.

484
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,317
- ‐ oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

485
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,163
I don't know. ‐ it's weird.

486
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,873
Want some?

487
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,964
‐ um...

488
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,287
Yeah, like, I just have to check

489
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,214
if Maya might want some too.

490
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,877
‐ I think she might be a little busy.

491
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,762
- Little man's making his move.
- Yeah.

492
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,066
What? ‐ what?

493
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,529
‐ it's... ‐ what?

494
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,699
‐ it's... ‐ no, I'm just happy.

495
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,704
For her. For Maya.

496
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,040
Yeah, fine. Whatever.

497
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,670
‐ ‐ can't believe I'm doing this.

498
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,214
‐ it's no big deal.

499
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,716
‐ oh, my god.

500
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,308
Sorry.

501
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,976
‐ yeah, that's how you
know it's the good stuff.

502
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,385
‐ oh, my god. Am I gonna get drunk?

503
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,904
‐ yeah.

504
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,225
‐ Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

505
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,402
‐

506
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,703
Pull over! It's the cops!

507
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,566
I said, it's the cops, bitch!

508
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,572
‐

509
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,124
You're funny.

510
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,578
‐ no, I'm not.

511
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,577
‐ you are.

512
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,504
‐ are you mad at me?

513
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,588
‐ no.

514
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,467
‐ do you wanna, like, kiss me now?

515
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,965
‐ someone could see.

516
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,484
Um...

517
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,555
‐ we can just put the seats down.

518
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,119
‐

519
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,626
Uh...

520
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,053
Uh...

521
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,723
That's my jaw.

522
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,392
Um...

523
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,311
Uh...

524
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,954
‐ what? ‐ what?

525
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:30,264
‐ you know how...

526
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,175
When we sort of kissed in my room,

527
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,795
you said that you had butterflies?

528
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,346
‐ yeah.

529
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,063
‐ I‐‐I didn't.

530
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,730
‐ okay.

531
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:51,941
‐ I'm sorry.

532
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,202
I still think that you're
one of the best actors

533
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,699
I've ever known, and...

534
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,700
It was an honor to share
the stage with you.

535
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,702
It j‐‐

536
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,580
‐ kay.

537
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,709
‐ it's not you.

538
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,388
I'm just trying to be honest.
