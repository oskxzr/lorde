1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,138
Taking a nap!

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,389
No one bother me!

3
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,553
Boobs.

4
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,756
‐ Hi, Ume.

5
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,260
I

6
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,983
I am hiding

7
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,845
The you I show to you

8
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,653
Is just a lie

9
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,528
You take what you want

10
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,105
You get what you take

11
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,570
-  Lie 
-  So high, high, high

12
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,495
‐ I didn't do that.
What'd sh‐‐what'd she say?

13
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,341
‐ She said she wants
to give you this pin.

14
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,548
It's from the plane.

15
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,507
‐ The pin?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

16
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,847
Oh, yeah, I get it.

17
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,005
Thought she was saying
something else.

18
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,604
Um, Shuji, can you ask her
if she wants to play with me?

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,730
‐ Why don't you ask her?

20
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,167
Ume‐‐

21
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,526
What?

22
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:36,447
What was that?

23
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,746
‐ Did you just say she's coming
to school with me?

24
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,117
I'm with you, Maya.

25
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,753
I‐‐most of this is goin' right
over my head.

26
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,632
‐ I'm following most
of everything they're saying.

27
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,419
‐ I do know, Ume,
that you look...

28
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,184
about the same as you were
when you were this big.

29
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,639
You're so cute.

30
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,154
‐ Me too, right, Dad?

31
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,805
I look the same
as that picture?

32
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,154
Yeah, you look the same.

33
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,358
Except you're, like, way bigger

34
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,148
and you have a mustache now.
‐ Shut up!

35
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,991
‐ Maya,
you are a beautiful woman.

36
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,856
‐ Dad, don't call me that.

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,533
‐ Well, you are.
‐ I'm not a woman, I'm a girl.

38
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,453
Like, I'm a kid.
I'm one year older than her.

39
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,161
‐ Well,
you're a little more mature.

40
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,461
‐ That's so gross and weird
for you to say, like,

41
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,955
I'm a little kid.

42
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,169
‐ Fuck!
‐ Dad.

43
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,589
‐ What?
‐ So good.

44
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,207
‐ The TV!
Come on‐‐

45
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,724
‐ Okay, well, let me try.

46
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,256
Give me‐‐
that's not the right one.

47
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,468
Did you try pressing the‐‐

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,682
‐ I bet the one that
your mother kept is working.

49
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,314
Just sayin'.

50
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,605
‐ Okay, well, we don't need
to watch something,

51
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,437
like, we can just...
chat.

52
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,784
Right? Really.
‐ Yeah, yeah.

53
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,580
‐ Um‐‐
oh, my God, congratulations

54
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,575
on your new place.

55
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,406
‐ Mm.
‐ Cheers.

56
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,752
‐ It's okay.
‐ It's really good.

57
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,167
‐ Yeah, I don't know how long
it's gonna take me to unpack.

58
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,127
‐ Well, I'll help you.

59
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,547
I'll help you make it feel
like your home.

60
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,336
‐ Does that mean that...

61
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,839
you know, you're gonna
pick my place full‐time?

62
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,011
'Cause that would
be really fun.

63
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,263
‐ I'm thinking about it.
‐ Yeah.

64
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,814
‐ Yeah,
I think it would be really fun.

65
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,017
‐ Oh, great.
‐ I really miss you.

66
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,308
Oh.

67
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,561
‐ I hoped that you would.
‐ You stay there.

68
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,022
I'll get it.

69
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,441
- Hello?
- Hey, Na, it's Mai.

70
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,614
‐ It's Maya.
‐ Na!

71
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,612
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

72
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,993
Are you at your dad's place?

73
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,069
‐ Yeah. It's great.
‐ Oh, my God. Amazing.

74
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,334
‐ No, I love it here.
It's so beautiful.

75
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,697
So you're never
gonna believe it,

76
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,083
but Ume is here from Japan.

77
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,289
‐ Are you serious?
‐ Yeah.

78
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,920
‐ "Oomi"‐‐Ume?
‐ Anna, it's Ume.

79
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,798
‐ No, that's what I meant.
Yeah, I can't wait to meet her.

80
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,456
Well, can you meet her now?

81
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,094
‐ I would love to, let me ask.

82
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,340
'Cause it's awkward
just the two of us.

83
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,682
‐ Hey, Dad.

84
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,846
Um, do you mind
if I go to Maya's?

85
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,345
‐ Uh, it's a school night.

86
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,887
‐ No, I know,
but it's a special occasion

87
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,310
'cause her friend's here
from Japan.

88
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,809
‐ Oh.

89
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,652
‐ Please?

90
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,477
‐ Yeah.
Yeah.

91
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,863
No, go ahead and go.

92
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,899
‐ Hi, he said I can go
and to have fun.

93
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,203
What? Okay, come right now!

94
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,696
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Bye.

95
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,629
‐ I've heard so much about you
from Maya,

96
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,470
and I'm glad that you're here.

97
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,006
‐ She doesn't speak English.

98
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,179
Like,
she can't understand that.

99
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,558
‐ Sayonara.

100
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,465
Na, that means bye.

101
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,684
‐ Oh, sorry.

102
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,944
‐ No.
‐ Okay‐‐oh, okay, okay.

103
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,356
I'm gonna translate for you.

104
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,033
‐ I always forget, like,
my best friend's fluent.

105
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,120
‐ Like, pretty fluent.

106
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,445
It's just 'cause
my mom's Japanese,

107
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,029
but, like, not fully.

108
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,494
‐ Don't downplay yourself.

109
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,464
‐ Isn't she, like, so cute?

110
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,916
I feel like we could pass
as twins, look.

111
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,787
Oh, yeah.

112
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,504
Or she's, like,
your baby sister.

113
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,264
‐ Mm.

114
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,258
Just 'cause her skin's
paler and she looks more, like,

115
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:30,311
innocent and, like,
she's shorter and, like‐‐

116
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,597
like, that stuff.

117
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,600
‐ Like me, like my‐‐
my skin and stuff.

118
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,613
‐ Yeah,
but hers is more porcelain‐y.

119
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,690
‐ Okay, thanks.

120
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:43,281
‐ No, not in a bad way.
Not in a bad way.

121
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,278
You both are beautiful.

122
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,829
She keeps staring at you.

123
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,378
‐ What?
‐ Nothing.

124
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,919
That's so mean, Ume.
That's not true, like‐‐

125
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,514
she said your nose is big.

126
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,050
Oh, that's okay.

127
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,694
I'm sorry. That‐‐ Ume‐‐

128
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,734
‐ I feel like ours
are the same size though.

129
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,596
Do you wanna just tell her
that really quick?

130
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,023
Uh‐‐yeah! Yeah!

131
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,347
It's the same, like‐‐ she gets it.

132
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,950
‐ Yeah, we don't...
‐ Sh‐‐

133
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,451
‐ Play‐‐it's a card game
we used to play.

134
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,664
- We don't wanna do that.
- Speedo?

135
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,254
You know, so I think‐‐
‐ What does "baba" mean?

136
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,263
‐ No to the cards.

137
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,007
Let's just, like,
play pretend or something.

138
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,772
Mm, got to get
my mash not lumpy,

139
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,806
'cause my angel doesn't
like lumpy mash.

140
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,730
‐ I know my angel,
and she likes a lumpy mash.

141
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,229
Yum, yum, yum!
It's a lumpy mash.

142
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,652
‐ Okay, well,
Steve likes a not lumpy mash,

143
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,991
just so you know.

144
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,445
‐ Oh, my God, Na.
You just said Steve.

145
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,867
‐ Oh, my God!
‐ Oh, my God!

146
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,786
Wait.
‐ No, I didn't mean to do that.

147
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,115
I didn't even mean
to say Steve.

148
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Like, that's my husband.

149
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,212
‐ Has he called you yet?
‐ Maybe, I don't know.

150
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,627
I gave him my mom's number,
and I'm at my dad's, so‐‐

151
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,666
‐ Well, wouldn't your mom tell
you if he called or something?

152
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,800
‐ Probably, yeah.
‐ Mama.

153
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,757
Okay, not now, Ume, like‐‐

154
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,637
Um, you guys have made out so
much, like, he's gonna call.

155
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,596
Hope so.

156
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,225
What's the guy

157
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,809
that likes me again,
what's his name?

158
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,114
- The high schooler?
- Derek.

159
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,648
School.

160
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,991
‐ Squirrel?

161
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:48,986
‐ No.
‐ Okay, squirrel.

162
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,487
‐ She's trying to‐‐
No, Anna,

163
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,278
she's trying to say school.

164
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,452
Like, sometimes words
come out differently

165
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,541
when you're not from here.

166
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,865
‐ Right.
‐ But she was just saying

167
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,290
"sker."

168
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,583
Anna, don't laugh!

169
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,633
That's mean!
That's, like,

170
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,585
how it's gonna
come out tomorrow.

171
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,705
She's gonna be like "sker."

172
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,921
They're gonna destroy her.

173
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,300
Oh, my God.

174
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,838
Oh, my God.

175
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,603
‐ They're gonna be,
like, so mean to her.

176
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,965
I mean, think about how people
barely like that I'm Asian.

177
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:21,193
She's full.
She's gonna get, like, roasted.

178
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,646
‐ Oh, my God.

179
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,685
Ume, at "sker"...

180
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,069
I know.

181
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,640
I protect you. You‐‐

182
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,597
- Can you just translate this?
- Okay.

183
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:39,273
We got your back.

184
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,288
She get‐‐she gets it now.

185
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,716
Uh, okay, class.

186
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,432
Maya's cousin is with us today.

187
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,393
‐ No, we're not related.

188
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,063
‐ Okay, friend then, whatever.

189
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,022
Uh, she wanted to see what
an American school was like,

190
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,653
so let's all be very welcoming
to her.

191
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,070
Why don't you come up front

192
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,438
so we can introduce you
to everyone.

193
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,625
Oh‐‐

194
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,242
‐ Do you want us
to go with you?

195
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,453
We should just go with‐‐

196
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,502
‐ I'm just gonna come up
with her, is that‐‐

197
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,286
‐ No,
you're fine where you are.

198
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,790
Ume means plum, right?

199
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,058
Everyone, this is Ume.

200
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,476
Let's give her a big
Trailview welcome, hm?

201
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,805
Yeah.

202
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,403
Thank you, school.

203
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,779
Oh, my God.

204
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,031
She's so cute.
I love her!

205
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,697
‐ What?

206
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,413
She actually loves
doing the peace sign so much.

207
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,374
She thinks it's so,
like, funny.

208
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,044
She'll put it in a photo.

209
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,502
‐ Mr. O,
can she please shadow me?

210
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,052
‐ Oh, she's shadowing us, so‐‐
‐ Yeah, she‐‐

211
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,916
I'm the only one
who speaks Japanese,

212
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,883
so she can't understand
without me.

213
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,764
Not the only one.

214
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,933
What's he saying?

215
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,521
‐ Shh, I'm trying to follow.

216
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,766
I'll explain later.

217
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,824
Have to be careful with Ume,

218
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,317
‐ Maya needs to translate,
you guys.

219
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,609
‐ You guys, stop!

220
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,862
Ah, you're touching her a lot.

221
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,954
Oh, my God!
‐ That's so cool‐looking!

222
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,410
‐ You guys,
you're gonna kill it.

223
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,210
She loves that thing.
I'll take care of it.

224
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,335
They really love Ume.
‐ Yeah.

225
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,165
Yeah.
‐ We were so worried.

226
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,760
‐ Unexpected, but wonderful.

227
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
‐ Hi, Ume.
Uh, my favorite fruit is plum.

228
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,723
‐ Don't look at us.

229
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,559
That's my ex.
He's, like, still not over me.

230
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,059
‐ He loves her.
‐ Ex‐eh.

231
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,902
Ai‐ai‐ai.
Get it?

232
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,147
‐ Hey, "Oomi."
Your hair's so pretty.

233
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,570
So black.

234
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,199
‐ My hair's always been black.

235
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,776
‐ Wait, Maya,
do you speak Japanese?

236
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,782
‐ Yeah.
‐ Ooh.

237
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,664
Can you ask "Oomi"
where she got her socks from?

238
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,751
‐ Yeah.
‐ I'm, like, totally obsessed.

239
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,456
‐ Yeah, I, like,
have the same socks.

240
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,996
They're just from Japan.

241
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,499
‐ What's up?
‐ What's up?

242
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,751
‐ Hector wanted me to tell you
that he thinks "Oomi"'s cute.

243
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,514
Ume! Come on, bro, go.

244
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,377
Ume!

245
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,844
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ They're so dumb.

246
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,933
‐ Hector‐‐the stripes,
thinks you're cute.

247
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:49,351
Just like the high schooler,
Steve, thinks I'm cute...

248
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,692
and wants to be with me.

249
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,188
‐ I don't care.

250
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,359
‐ Anna, she doesn't understand
English or gestures like‐‐

251
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,989
‐ That's why you're here
to translate.

252
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,646
‐ Okay, I know.
I just said it.

253
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,324
Okay.

254
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,372
‐ Yeah, Hector wants to play
Crashed Bandicoot: Warped

255
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,327
with her and hang out.

256
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,367
‐ Go tell her.
‐ Um...

257
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,223
I just told her.
What?

258
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,005
‐ Well, you guys,
maybe everyone should just

259
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,180
hang out at Maya's.

260
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,547
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ If you want,

261
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,724
because that's
where Ume's staying.

262
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,603
‐ Yeah.
She, um, she has DDR and stuff.

263
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,440
It's this, like, cool,
like, Japanese dance game.

264
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,517
Um‐‐

265
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,021
If you guys want, like‐‐

266
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,396
Yeah, she'd love that.
So if you guys wanna just‐‐

267
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,862
you can invite Hector
or whatever,

268
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,412
and you all can come too.

269
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,605
‐ Yeah.
‐ What's DDR?

270
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,454
‐ Yeah, cool.
‐ It's the dance‐‐

271
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,950
‐ I'll go tell him right now.

272
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,791
‐ Cool, if I can.
‐ Yeah.

273
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,706
‐ Ume!
Ume.

274
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,915
‐ Hey, uh, "Hector."

275
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,296
Hector!

276
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,955
‐ What,
are you bored of me already?

277
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,344
Just like your mom?

278
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,221
Just kidding.
But you know, the more time

279
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,598
you spend with Maya, you know,
cuts into my time with ya.

280
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,556
‐ No, I know, but she just
needs my help, like,

281
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,807
with the party, you know?

282
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:15,188
‐ Okay, well,
when you get home,

283
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,358
I have a surprise for you.

284
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,605
‐ Oh, that's so nice.
Okay, cool.

285
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,028
Love you, Dad!
Thank you so much!

286
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,486
‐ I love you too.

287
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,083
Okay, so you have to press it

288
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,286
on the arrows‐‐
‐ I know.

289
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,325
‐ So where's Ume?
‐ No, you don't know

290
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,448
how to play.

291
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,414
No‐‐Anna.

292
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,624
- Please don't touch it.
- Sorry.

293
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,794
Just give me a second.

294
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,212
Dance Dance Revolution.

295
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,131
‐ Okay, it's set up.
Ready?

296
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,592
So you're gonna do these two,
and I'm gonna do these two.

297
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,763
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay, ready?

298
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,978
Anna, Anna, Anna.
Right, right‐‐no.

299
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,556
Oh, my God, Anna!
‐ It's not sensing me.

300
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,362
Okay, we failed.

301
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,146
That's 'cause Anna was
hitting it wrong.

302
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,859
‐ I don't think you guys need
to stomp so hard.

303
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,189
It only takes a light touch.

304
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,704
Anna was stomping really hard.

305
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,615
‐ Maya, I was doing the guy.
‐ You were supposed to‐‐

306
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,945
‐ Okay, head count on hot dogs.
‐ Dad, get out, please.

307
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,212
‐ I'll make the full pack.
‐ Go!

308
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,665
That's your dad?

309
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,535
He's not Japanese though.

310
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,092
‐ Yeah, he's white.
‐ Weird.

311
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,546
You look full.

312
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,217
No, I don't.

313
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,545
‐ Um, Hector, when will the
rest of your friends be here?

314
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,642
‐ Uh, they never said anything.

315
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,467
Also, my dad dropped me off.

316
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,353
‐ Sick.

317
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,481
‐ Hi!
Come here, come sit.

318
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,728
‐ My bro!

319
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,439
- What up?
- Get off!

320
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,059
Ow, don't move my arm
like that, you psycho.

321
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:48,031
‐ Whoa. "Sooji,"
your Japanese is really good.

322
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,200
‐ "Sooji,"
you and "Oomi" actually

323
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,868
look more related
than you and Maya.

324
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:55,327
‐ Yeah, that's because me
and Maya are half‐siblings.

325
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,909
Unfortunately,
she got the bad half.

326
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,334
‐ Oh, really?
‐ Yeah.

327
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,962
‐ Is white the bad half?
‐ Yeah!

328
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,169
‐ You wish you had more white
in you.

329
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,209
You'd look way better, bitch.

330
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,632
‐ I actually think, Shuji,

331
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,720
that you're very, very
attractive the way you are.

332
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,126
‐ Ew, Anna.

333
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,104
‐ Wait, hold on, so the hot dog
guy isn't your dad?

334
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,965
No, uh, my birth dad

335
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,312
lives in Japan.

336
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,227
‐ Yeah,
but that's still our dad.

337
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,685
‐ That's like‐‐
‐ Yeah.

338
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,015
‐ He's your dad.
‐ I know.

339
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,770
‐ That's why you and Ume have
such exotic names.

340
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,233
I've always wanted my name
to be Yolanda.

341
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,994
Yeah, and that's why
I can speak Japanese fluently,

342
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,407
and Maya can barely
say a sentence.

343
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,236
‐ That's‐‐you're lying.
I speak full Japanese.

344
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,582
Tell them.

345
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,327
Perfect, perfect, p‐‐perfect.

346
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,579
‐ Are you guys seeing this?

347
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,920
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

348
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,785
Holy shit.
"Oomi," can I play with you?

349
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,042
You're, like, perfect.

350
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,469
All right, that's enough.

351
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,432
My turn.

352
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,442
‐ Maya.
Don't move her arm like that.

353
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,845
‐ I didn't move her arm li‐‐
I, like, touched her

354
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,404
- like you touched my arm.
- Now she's crying.

355
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,567
Great job, idiot.

356
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,066
‐ Sorry!

357
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,568
She's crying
'cause everybody loves her?

358
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,990
‐ Okay, weird.
‐ Guess she's not into you.

359
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,160
I mean, honestly, like,

360
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,039
I love her,
but she's kind of a problem.

361
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,246
‐ No, and I hope that she's
okay, and I felt super bad,

362
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,668
but I'm also like, everybody's
complimenting you up the ass.

363
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,088
‐ We're sleeping
on the floor for you.

364
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,876
Like, can you stop
being such a crazy bitch?

365
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
‐ Yeah.
‐ Like, honestly.

366
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,921
‐ No, like, seriously.

367
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,514
‐ And I love her, but, like‐‐

368
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,719
‐ I love her,
but she is an attention whore.

369
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,889
‐ Truly, truly, truly.
‐ Because she's just like,

370
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,178
oh...
you know?

371
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,102
‐ Like‐‐

372
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,692
and then, like‐‐

373
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,727
Like, bitch.

374
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,935
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey, Ume.

375
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,159
I just‐‐

376
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,422
Anna, I just asked
if you're okay,

377
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,955
and she didn't answer.

378
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,169
Oh.

379
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,879
Guess it's time for bed.

380
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,307
‐ Get out!
Get out‐‐

381
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,963
What?

382
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,338
Pig Latin.

383
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:07,314
Smart.

384
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,598
‐ Hm?

385
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,127
‐ Like, she's kind of a liar.

386
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,297
Like, she'll say
she saw people doing things

387
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,667
that they weren't doing,
like, it's really weird.

388
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,184
Get out!

389
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,507
‐ I mean, I haven't
personally seen her do that,

390
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,144
but I also
don't speak Japanese,

391
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,691
so I could be wrong,
like, I trust you.

392
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,686
I trust you that you're right.

393
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,783
‐ Oh, my God.
What?

394
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,489
Ume, what?

395
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,659
Did you just see her glare
at me?

396
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,000
Like, that's crazy.
‐ Mm.

397
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,245
I'm just feeling really
stressed out, like‐‐

398
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,998
‐ She needs to go.

399
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,457
‐ Okay, get up.
We're gonna fix this.

400
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,091
Let's go.

401
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,129
Um, sorry.

402
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,050
‐ Mrs. Ishii‐Peters,
we'll be back.

403
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,143
‐ Okay.
‐ Got to fix this.

404
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,427
Maya, go.

405
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,273
Okay, you guys...

406
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,034
just hug.

407
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,855
Hug.

408
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,870
‐ See, she doesn't
even want to touch me.

409
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,276
She, like,
thinks I'm disgusting.

410
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,419
‐ Hug her.

411
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,036
‐ Like,
if you think I'm disgusting

412
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,442
and you don't like me,
you can leave.

413
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,860
Like, honestly...

414
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,830
What?

415
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,108
You're yelling at me. Like, s‐‐

416
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,817
Anna, she's yelling at me!

417
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,861
‐ You're yelling at me!
Like, stop, you're yelling!

418
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,241
‐ Did you just call me stupid?

419
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,911
She just called me stupid.
You think I'm stupid?

420
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,791
Fuck you.

421
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,577
Sorry, like, fuck you,
honestly!

422
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,001
Everyone thinks she's perfect.

423
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,539
You're so much better than me,
okay?

424
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,752
You win.
‐ Maya,

425
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,712
she's a year younger
than us, like, chill.

426
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,762
‐ Why is everyone
on Ume's side?

427
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:49,507
Why is being Japanese special
on her and bad on me?

428
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,261
Why?

429
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,603
‐ Oh, my God,
I'm getting your mom.

430
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,308
I'm getting your mom, Maya.

431
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,476
I hate you.

432
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,982
I really hate you.

433
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,827
Ume.

434
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,746
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

435
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,536
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, I don't mean it.

436
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,500
Okay? I'm sorry.

437
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,516
‐ I love you.

438
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,095
What's going on?

439
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,194
‐ I think they're okay.

440
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,800
‐ Hey, Dad!

441
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,585
Dad?

442
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,047
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey, Dad.

443
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,469
Hey.

444
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,837
You know, there's nowhere
to lock up my bike

445
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,184
outside of this frickin' place.

446
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,559
‐ Oh, that sucks.
‐ Yeah.

447
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,345
‐ Hey, did anyone call for me?
‐ Uh...

448
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,770
no.

449
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,059
Um, not that I know of.

450
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,483
Oops.

451
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,782
Sorry.

452
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,355
Wow.

453
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,649
What have you been doing
in here?

454
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,572
‐ I just kind of unpacked
your kitchen stuff, so‐‐

455
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,162
Yeah, the kitchen looks great.

456
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,867
Thank you.
‐ You're welcome.

457
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,077
‐ Spending some time
at your dad's house, huh?

458
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,538
So does this mean

459
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,287
that you're gonna
make it full‐time?

460
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,249
‐ Um, maybe.

461
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,579
I got a surprise for ya.

462
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,594
You know, I think it's gonna
really move that meter

463
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,546
to, uh, I love my dad the most.

464
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,916
Nah, I'm just kidding.

465
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,263
‐ The cheese and corn's
not melted,

466
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,837
but I think it'll be fine.

467
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,472
Um...

468
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,724
Smells good.

469
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,522
‐ Ow.
Dad‐‐

470
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,900
Ta‐da!

471
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,436
Da‐da‐da.

472
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,650
What the fuck, Anna?

473
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,860
‐ I know, I just‐‐
I thought‐‐

474
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,779
‐ This is my new oven!
‐ I know, I'm sorry.

475
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,898
I thought it was glass‐‐
‐ You know, you don't

476
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,364
put plastic in an oven.

477
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,454
What are you doing?

478
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,568
‐ I thought it was glass‐‐
‐ God!

479
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,954
Ugh.
‐ I'm sorry‐‐

480
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,911
‐ That's why you don't do this
when I'm not here, okay?

481
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,201
‐ Okay.
‐ Here, come on, move.

482
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,624
Move, move, move.
‐ Okay.

483
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,622
‐ You're only‐‐
‐ Okay!

484
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,583
You're only 13.

485
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,293
‐ I thought it was glass.

486
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,128
I was just trying to help.

487
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,883
Ugh.

488
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,562
A hamster?

489
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,557
‐ I‐‐I wanted
to get you something so that

490
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,559
when you go back
to your mom's this week

491
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,441
and I'm not with you, you‐‐

492
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,897
you have someone
to keep you company.

493
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,910
Anna, the phone.
‐ Okay, okay!

494
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,115
Got it.

495
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,365
Hi, you've reached the Kones.

496
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,826
This is Anna speaking.
How can I help you?

497
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,747
Yo, how can I help you?

498
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,206
‐ Yo?
Oh, Steve?

499
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,537
Yo.

500
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,213
Things may come
to those who wait,

501
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,131
but only the things left
by those who hustle.

502
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,631
How you been?
‐ Busy.

503
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,756
Ah!

504
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,519
Nah!

505
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,489
Fell.

506
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,497
‐ Mm‐‐I don't know‐‐

507
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,285
I don't know what that means.

508
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,087
‐ No...
clothes.

509
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,705
Um... hot.

510
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,386
Yeah.

511
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:55,066
‐ Mm, me too.

512
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,657
Mm‐‐
