WEBVTT

00:13.138 --> 00:14.138
Taking a nap!

00:14.139 --> 00:16.389
No one bother me!

00:47.923 --> 00:49.553
Boobs.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.756
‐ Hi, Ume.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.260
I

01:36.263 --> 01:39.983
I am hiding

01:39.975 --> 01:42.845
The you I show to you

01:42.853 --> 01:46.653
Is just a lie

01:46.648 --> 01:48.528
You take what you want

01:48.525 --> 01:50.105
You get what you take

01:50.110 --> 01:53.570
-  Lie
-  So high, high, high

02:03.415 --> 02:06.495
‐ I didn't do that.
What'd sh‐‐what'd she say?

02:06.501 --> 02:09.341
‐ She said she wants
to give you this pin.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.548
It's from the plane.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.507
‐ The pin?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

02:12.507 --> 02:16.847
Oh, yeah, I get it.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.005
Thought she was saying
something else.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.604
Um, Shuji, can you ask her
if she wants to play with me?

02:21.600 --> 02:23.730
‐ Why don't you ask her?

02:25.437 --> 02:27.167
Ume‐‐

02:31.026 --> 02:32.526
What?

02:32.527 --> 02:36.447
What was that?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.746
‐ Did you just say she's coming
to school with me?

02:43.747 --> 02:45.117
I'm with you, Maya.

02:45.123 --> 02:48.753
I‐‐most of this is goin' right
over my head.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.632
‐ I'm following most
of everything they're saying.

02:50.629 --> 02:54.419
‐ I do know, Ume,
that you look...

02:54.424 --> 02:57.184
about the same as you were
when you were this big.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.639
You're so cute.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.154
‐ Me too, right, Dad?

03:07.145 --> 03:08.805
I look the same
as that picture?

03:08.814 --> 03:10.154
Yeah, you look the same.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.358
Except you're, like, way bigger

03:11.358 --> 03:13.148
and you have a mustache now.
‐ Shut up!

03:13.151 --> 03:14.991
‐ Maya,
you are a beautiful woman.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.856
‐ Dad, don't call me that.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.533
‐ Well, you are.
‐ I'm not a woman, I'm a girl.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.453
Like, I'm a kid.
I'm one year older than her.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.161
‐ Well,
you're a little more mature.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.461
‐ That's so gross and weird
for you to say, like,

03:25.455 --> 03:26.955
I'm a little kid.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.169
‐ Fuck!
‐ Dad.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.589
‐ What?
‐ So good.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.207
‐ The TV!
Come on‐‐

03:34.214 --> 03:36.724
‐ Okay, well, let me try.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.256
Give me‐‐
that's not the right one.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.468
Did you try pressing the‐‐

03:42.472 --> 03:45.682
‐ I bet the one that
your mother kept is working.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.314
Just sayin'.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.605
‐ Okay, well, we don't need
to watch something,

03:52.607 --> 03:55.437
like, we can just...
chat.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.784
Right? Really.
‐ Yeah, yeah.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.580
‐ Um‐‐
oh, my God, congratulations

04:01.575 --> 04:02.575
on your new place.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.406
‐ Mm.
‐ Cheers.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.752
‐ It's okay.
‐ It's really good.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.167
‐ Yeah, I don't know how long
it's gonna take me to unpack.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.127
‐ Well, I'll help you.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.547
I'll help you make it feel
like your home.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.336
‐ Does that mean that...

04:16.339 --> 04:18.839
you know, you're gonna
pick my place full‐time?

04:21.011 --> 04:23.011
'Cause that would
be really fun.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.263
‐ I'm thinking about it.
‐ Yeah.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.814
‐ Yeah,
I think it would be really fun.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.017
‐ Oh, great.
‐ I really miss you.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.308
Oh.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.561
‐ I hoped that you would.
‐ You stay there.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.022
I'll get it.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.441
- Hello?
- Hey, Na, it's Mai.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.614
‐ It's Maya.
‐ Na!

04:38.612 --> 04:39.612
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.993
Are you at your dad's place?

04:40.989 --> 04:43.069
‐ Yeah. It's great.
‐ Oh, my God. Amazing.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.334
‐ No, I love it here.
It's so beautiful.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.697
So you're never
gonna believe it,

04:46.703 --> 04:48.083
but Ume is here from Japan.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.289
‐ Are you serious?
‐ Yeah.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.920
‐ "Oomi"‐‐Ume?
‐ Anna, it's Ume.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.798
‐ No, that's what I meant.
Yeah, I can't wait to meet her.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.456
Well, can you meet her now?

04:57.464 --> 04:59.094
‐ I would love to, let me ask.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.340
'Cause it's awkward
just the two of us.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.682
‐ Hey, Dad.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.846
Um, do you mind
if I go to Maya's?

05:03.845 --> 05:05.345
‐ Uh, it's a school night.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.887
‐ No, I know,
but it's a special occasion

05:06.890 --> 05:09.310
'cause her friend's here
from Japan.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.809
‐ Oh.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.652
‐ Please?

05:13.647 --> 05:16.477
‐ Yeah.
Yeah.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.863
No, go ahead and go.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.899
‐ Hi, he said I can go
and to have fun.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.203
What? Okay, come right now!

05:21.196 --> 05:22.696
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Bye.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.629
‐ I've heard so much about you
from Maya,

05:38.630 --> 05:41.470
and I'm glad that you're here.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.006
‐ She doesn't speak English.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.179
Like,
she can't understand that.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.558
‐ Sayonara.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.465
Na, that means bye.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.684
‐ Oh, sorry.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.944
‐ No.
‐ Okay‐‐oh, okay, okay.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.356
I'm gonna translate for you.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.033
‐ I always forget, like,
my best friend's fluent.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.120
‐ Like, pretty fluent.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.445
It's just 'cause
my mom's Japanese,

06:06.449 --> 06:08.029
but, like, not fully.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.494
‐ Don't downplay yourself.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.464
‐ Isn't she, like, so cute?

06:13.456 --> 06:15.916
I feel like we could pass
as twins, look.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.787
Oh, yeah.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.504
Or she's, like,
your baby sister.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.264
‐ Mm.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.258
Just 'cause her skin's
paler and she looks more, like,

06:26.261 --> 06:30.311
innocent and, like,
she's shorter and, like‐‐

06:30.307 --> 06:31.597
like, that stuff.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.600
‐ Like me, like my‐‐
my skin and stuff.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.613
‐ Yeah,
but hers is more porcelain‐y.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.690
‐ Okay, thanks.

06:39.691 --> 06:43.281
‐ No, not in a bad way.
Not in a bad way.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.278
You both are beautiful.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.829
She keeps staring at you.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.378
‐ What?
‐ Nothing.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.919
That's so mean, Ume.
That's not true, like‐‐

07:04.924 --> 07:07.514
she said your nose is big.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.050
Oh, that's okay.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.694
I'm sorry. That‐‐ Ume‐‐

07:12.974 --> 07:14.734
‐ I feel like ours
are the same size though.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.596
Do you wanna just tell her
that really quick?

07:16.603 --> 07:20.023
Uh‐‐yeah! Yeah!

07:22.067 --> 07:25.347
It's the same, like‐‐ she gets it.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.950
‐ Yeah, we don't...
‐ Sh‐‐

07:31.951 --> 07:34.451
‐ Play‐‐it's a card game
we used to play.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.664
- We don't wanna do that.
- Speedo?

07:39.584 --> 07:42.254
You know, so I think‐‐
‐ What does "baba" mean?

07:42.253 --> 07:45.263
‐ No to the cards.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.007
Let's just, like,
play pretend or something.

07:51.012 --> 07:54.772
Mm, got to get
my mash not lumpy,

07:54.766 --> 07:56.806
'cause my angel doesn't
like lumpy mash.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.730
‐ I know my angel,
and she likes a lumpy mash.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.229
Yum, yum, yum!
It's a lumpy mash.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.652
‐ Okay, well,
Steve likes a not lumpy mash,

08:04.651 --> 08:05.991
just so you know.

08:05.985 --> 08:09.445
‐ Oh, my God, Na.
You just said Steve.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.867
‐ Oh, my God!
‐ Oh, my God!

08:11.866 --> 08:13.786
Wait.
‐ No, I didn't mean to do that.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.115
I didn't even mean
to say Steve.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.120
Like, that's my husband.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.212
‐ Has he called you yet?
‐ Maybe, I don't know.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.627
I gave him my mom's number,
and I'm at my dad's, so‐‐

08:21.626 --> 08:23.666
‐ Well, wouldn't your mom tell
you if he called or something?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.800
‐ Probably, yeah.
‐ Mama.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.757
Okay, not now, Ume, like‐‐

08:27.757 --> 08:31.637
Um, you guys have made out so
much, like, he's gonna call.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.596
Hope so.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.225
What's the guy

08:41.229 --> 08:42.809
that likes me again,
what's his name?

08:42.814 --> 08:45.114
- The high schooler?
- Derek.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.648
School.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.991
‐ Squirrel?

08:47.986 --> 08:48.986
‐ No.
‐ Okay, squirrel.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.487
‐ She's trying to‐‐
No, Anna,

08:50.488 --> 08:52.278
she's trying to say school.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.452
Like, sometimes words
come out differently

08:54.451 --> 08:55.541
when you're not from here.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.865
‐ Right.
‐ But she was just saying

08:56.870 --> 08:58.290
"sker."

09:00.123 --> 09:01.583
Anna, don't laugh!

09:01.583 --> 09:02.633
That's mean!
That's, like,

09:02.625 --> 09:03.585
how it's gonna
come out tomorrow.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.705
She's gonna be like "sker."

09:04.711 --> 09:05.921
They're gonna destroy her.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.300
Oh, my God.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.838
Oh, my God.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.603
‐ They're gonna be,
like, so mean to her.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.965
I mean, think about how people
barely like that I'm Asian.

09:16.973 --> 09:21.193
She's full.
She's gonna get, like, roasted.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.646
‐ Oh, my God.

09:22.645 --> 09:26.685
Ume, at "sker"...

09:28.359 --> 09:30.069
I know.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.640
I protect you. You‐‐

09:34.157 --> 09:36.597
- Can you just translate this?
- Okay.

09:36.603 --> 09:39.273
We got your back.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.288
She get‐‐she gets it now.

09:54.886 --> 09:57.716
Uh, okay, class.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.432
Maya's cousin is with us today.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.393
‐ No, we're not related.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.063
‐ Okay, friend then, whatever.

10:04.062 --> 10:07.022
Uh, she wanted to see what
an American school was like,

10:07.023 --> 10:08.653
so let's all be very welcoming
to her.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.070
Why don't you come up front

10:10.068 --> 10:11.438
so we can introduce you
to everyone.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.625
Oh‐‐

10:17.242 --> 10:18.242
‐ Do you want us
to go with you?

10:18.243 --> 10:19.453
We should just go with‐‐

10:19.452 --> 10:21.502
‐ I'm just gonna come up
with her, is that‐‐

10:21.496 --> 10:24.286
‐ No,
you're fine where you are.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.790
Ume means plum, right?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.058
Everyone, this is Ume.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.476
Let's give her a big
Trailview welcome, hm?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.805
Yeah.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.403
Thank you, school.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.779
Oh, my God.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.031
She's so cute.
I love her!

10:57.407 --> 10:58.697
‐ What?

11:02.203 --> 11:04.413
She actually loves
doing the peace sign so much.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.374
She thinks it's so,
like, funny.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.044
She'll put it in a photo.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.502
‐ Mr. O,
can she please shadow me?

11:09.502 --> 11:12.052
‐ Oh, she's shadowing us, so‐‐
‐ Yeah, she‐‐

11:12.046 --> 11:13.916
I'm the only one
who speaks Japanese,

11:13.923 --> 11:15.883
so she can't understand
without me.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.764
Not the only one.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.933
What's he saying?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.521
‐ Shh, I'm trying to follow.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.766
I'll explain later.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.824
Have to be careful with Ume,

11:32.817 --> 11:34.317
‐ Maya needs to translate,
you guys.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.609
‐ You guys, stop!

11:35.612 --> 11:37.862
Ah, you're touching her a lot.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.954
Oh, my God!
‐ That's so cool‐looking!

11:40.950 --> 11:42.410
‐ You guys,
you're gonna kill it.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.210
She loves that thing.
I'll take care of it.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.335
They really love Ume.
‐ Yeah.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.165
Yeah.
‐ We were so worried.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.760
‐ Unexpected, but wonderful.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.800
‐ Hi, Ume.
Uh, my favorite fruit is plum.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.723
‐ Don't look at us.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.559
That's my ex.
He's, like, still not over me.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.059
‐ He loves her.
‐ Ex‐eh.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.902
Ai‐ai‐ai.
Get it?

12:10.897 --> 12:14.147
‐ Hey, "Oomi."
Your hair's so pretty.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.570
So black.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.199
‐ My hair's always been black.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.776
‐ Wait, Maya,
do you speak Japanese?

12:20.782 --> 12:22.782
‐ Yeah.
‐ Ooh.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.664
Can you ask "Oomi"
where she got her socks from?

12:24.661 --> 12:26.751
‐ Yeah.
‐ I'm, like, totally obsessed.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.456
‐ Yeah, I, like,
have the same socks.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.996
They're just from Japan.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.499
‐ What's up?
‐ What's up?

12:31.501 --> 12:34.751
‐ Hector wanted me to tell you
that he thinks "Oomi"'s cute.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.514
Ume! Come on, bro, go.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.377
Ume!

12:39.384 --> 12:40.844
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ They're so dumb.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.933
‐ Hector‐‐the stripes,
thinks you're cute.

12:44.931 --> 12:49.351
Just like the high schooler,
Steve, thinks I'm cute...

12:49.352 --> 12:51.692
and wants to be with me.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.188
‐ I don't care.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.359
‐ Anna, she doesn't understand
English or gestures like‐‐

12:56.359 --> 12:57.989
‐ That's why you're here
to translate.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.646
‐ Okay, I know.
I just said it.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.324
Okay.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.372
‐ Yeah, Hector wants to play
Crashed Bandicoot: Warped

13:04.367 --> 13:06.327
with her and hang out.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.367
‐ Go tell her.
‐ Um...

13:17.213 --> 13:19.223
I just told her.
What?

13:19.215 --> 13:22.005
‐ Well, you guys,
maybe everyone should just

13:22.010 --> 13:23.180
hang out at Maya's.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.547
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ If you want,

13:24.554 --> 13:26.724
because that's
where Ume's staying.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.603
‐ Yeah.
She, um, she has DDR and stuff.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.440
It's this, like, cool,
like, Japanese dance game.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.517
Um‐‐

13:33.521 --> 13:35.021
If you guys want, like‐‐

13:37.066 --> 13:39.396
Yeah, she'd love that.
So if you guys wanna just‐‐

13:39.402 --> 13:40.862
you can invite Hector
or whatever,

13:40.862 --> 13:42.412
and you all can come too.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.605
‐ Yeah.
‐ What's DDR?

13:43.614 --> 13:45.454
‐ Yeah, cool.
‐ It's the dance‐‐

13:45.450 --> 13:46.950
‐ I'll go tell him right now.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.791
‐ Cool, if I can.
‐ Yeah.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.706
‐ Ume!
Ume.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.915
‐ Hey, uh, "Hector."

13:53.916 --> 13:57.296
Hector!

13:57.295 --> 13:59.955
‐ What,
are you bored of me already?

13:59.964 --> 14:02.344
Just like your mom?

14:02.341 --> 14:04.221
Just kidding.
But you know, the more time

14:04.218 --> 14:06.598
you spend with Maya, you know,
cuts into my time with ya.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.556
‐ No, I know, but she just
needs my help, like,

14:09.557 --> 14:10.807
with the party, you know?

14:10.808 --> 14:15.188
‐ Okay, well,
when you get home,

14:15.188 --> 14:16.358
I have a surprise for you.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.605
‐ Oh, that's so nice.
Okay, cool.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.028
Love you, Dad!
Thank you so much!

14:20.026 --> 14:21.486
‐ I love you too.

14:25.073 --> 14:28.083
Okay, so you have to press it

14:28.076 --> 14:29.286
on the arrows‐‐
‐ I know.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.325
‐ So where's Ume?
‐ No, you don't know

14:30.328 --> 14:31.448
how to play.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.414
No‐‐Anna.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.624
- Please don't touch it.
- Sorry.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.794
Just give me a second.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.212
Dance Dance Revolution.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.131
‐ Okay, it's set up.
Ready?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.592
So you're gonna do these two,
and I'm gonna do these two.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.763
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay, ready?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.978
Anna, Anna, Anna.
Right, right‐‐no.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.556
Oh, my God, Anna!
‐ It's not sensing me.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.362
Okay, we failed.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.146
That's 'cause Anna was
hitting it wrong.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.859
‐ I don't think you guys need
to stomp so hard.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.189
It only takes a light touch.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.704
Anna was stomping really hard.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.615
‐ Maya, I was doing the guy.
‐ You were supposed to‐‐

15:07.615 --> 15:10.945
‐ Okay, head count on hot dogs.
‐ Dad, get out, please.

15:10.952 --> 15:14.212
‐ I'll make the full pack.
‐ Go!

15:14.205 --> 15:15.665
That's your dad?

15:15.665 --> 15:17.535
He's not Japanese though.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.092
‐ Yeah, he's white.
‐ Weird.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.546
You look full.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.217
No, I don't.

15:24.215 --> 15:27.545
‐ Um, Hector, when will the
rest of your friends be here?

15:27.552 --> 15:29.642
‐ Uh, they never said anything.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.467
Also, my dad dropped me off.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.353
‐ Sick.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.481
‐ Hi!
Come here, come sit.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.728
‐ My bro!

15:38.729 --> 15:40.439
- What up?
- Get off!

15:40.439 --> 15:43.059
Ow, don't move my arm
like that, you psycho.

15:44.151 --> 15:48.031
‐ Whoa. "Sooji,"
your Japanese is really good.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.200
‐ "Sooji,"
you and "Oomi" actually

15:49.198 --> 15:50.868
look more related
than you and Maya.

15:50.867 --> 15:55.327
‐ Yeah, that's because me
and Maya are half‐siblings.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.909
Unfortunately,
she got the bad half.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.334
‐ Oh, really?
‐ Yeah.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.962
‐ Is white the bad half?
‐ Yeah!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.169
‐ You wish you had more white
in you.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.209
You'd look way better, bitch.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.632
‐ I actually think, Shuji,

16:04.630 --> 16:06.720
that you're very, very
attractive the way you are.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.126
‐ Ew, Anna.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.104
‐ Wait, hold on, so the hot dog
guy isn't your dad?

16:11.095 --> 16:12.965
No, uh, my birth dad

16:12.972 --> 16:14.312
lives in Japan.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.227
‐ Yeah,
but that's still our dad.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.685
‐ That's like‐‐
‐ Yeah.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.015
‐ He's your dad.
‐ I know.

16:19.020 --> 16:22.770
‐ That's why you and Ume have
such exotic names.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.233
I've always wanted my name
to be Yolanda.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.994
Yeah, and that's why
I can speak Japanese fluently,

16:27.987 --> 16:30.407
and Maya can barely
say a sentence.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.236
‐ That's‐‐you're lying.
I speak full Japanese.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.582
Tell them.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.327
Perfect, perfect, p‐‐perfect.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.579
‐ Are you guys seeing this?

16:37.580 --> 16:38.920
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.785
Holy shit.
"Oomi," can I play with you?

16:41.792 --> 16:43.042
You're, like, perfect.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.469
All right, that's enough.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.432
My turn.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.442
‐ Maya.
Don't move her arm like that.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.845
‐ I didn't move her arm li‐‐
I, like, touched her

17:01.854 --> 17:03.404
- like you touched my arm.
- Now she's crying.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.567
Great job, idiot.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.066
‐ Sorry!

17:07.068 --> 17:09.568
She's crying
'cause everybody loves her?

17:09.570 --> 17:12.990
‐ Okay, weird.
‐ Guess she's not into you.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.160
I mean, honestly, like,

17:15.159 --> 17:17.039
I love her,
but she's kind of a problem.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.246
‐ No, and I hope that she's
okay, and I felt super bad,

17:20.248 --> 17:23.668
but I'm also like, everybody's
complimenting you up the ass.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.088
‐ We're sleeping
on the floor for you.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.876
Like, can you stop
being such a crazy bitch?

17:27.880 --> 17:28.880
‐ Yeah.
‐ Like, honestly.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.921
‐ No, like, seriously.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.514
‐ And I love her, but, like‐‐

17:31.509 --> 17:33.719
‐ I love her,
but she is an attention whore.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.889
‐ Truly, truly, truly.
‐ Because she's just like,

17:35.888 --> 17:38.178
oh...
you know?

17:38.182 --> 17:41.102
‐ Like‐‐

17:41.102 --> 17:42.692
and then, like‐‐

17:42.687 --> 17:43.727
Like, bitch.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.935
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey, Ume.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.159
I just‐‐

18:00.162 --> 18:02.422
Anna, I just asked
if you're okay,

18:02.415 --> 18:04.955
and she didn't answer.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.169
Oh.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.879
Guess it's time for bed.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.307
‐ Get out!
Get out‐‐

20:53.753 --> 20:54.963
What?

21:00.968 --> 21:02.338
Pig Latin.

21:02.344 --> 21:07.314
Smart.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.598
‐ Hm?

21:33.417 --> 21:35.127
‐ Like, she's kind of a liar.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.297
Like, she'll say
she saw people doing things

21:38.297 --> 21:40.667
that they weren't doing,
like, it's really weird.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.184
Get out!

21:43.177 --> 21:46.507
‐ I mean, I haven't
personally seen her do that,

21:46.514 --> 21:49.144
but I also
don't speak Japanese,

21:49.141 --> 21:52.691
so I could be wrong,
like, I trust you.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.686
I trust you that you're right.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.783
‐ Oh, my God.
What?

22:01.779 --> 22:03.489
Ume, what?

22:05.449 --> 22:07.659
Did you just see her glare
at me?

22:07.660 --> 22:10.000
Like, that's crazy.
‐ Mm.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.245
I'm just feeling really
stressed out, like‐‐

22:12.248 --> 22:13.998
‐ She needs to go.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.457
‐ Okay, get up.
We're gonna fix this.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.091
Let's go.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.129
Um, sorry.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.050
‐ Mrs. Ishii‐Peters,
we'll be back.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.143
‐ Okay.
‐ Got to fix this.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.427
Maya, go.

22:35.813 --> 22:38.273
Okay, you guys...

22:38.274 --> 22:40.034
just hug.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.855
Hug.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.870
‐ See, she doesn't
even want to touch me.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.276
She, like,
thinks I'm disgusting.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.419
‐ Hug her.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.036
‐ Like,
if you think I'm disgusting

22:57.042 --> 22:59.442
and you don't like me,
you can leave.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.860
Like, honestly...

23:06.010 --> 23:06.830
What?

23:12.158 --> 23:14.108
You're yelling at me. Like, s‐‐

23:15.227 --> 23:16.817
Anna, she's yelling at me!

23:18.731 --> 23:22.861
‐ You're yelling at me!
Like, stop, you're yelling!

23:27.281 --> 23:29.241
‐ Did you just call me stupid?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.911
She just called me stupid.
You think I'm stupid?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.791
Fuck you.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.577
Sorry, like, fuck you,
honestly!

23:35.581 --> 23:37.001
Everyone thinks she's perfect.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.539
You're so much better than me,
okay?

23:38.542 --> 23:39.752
You win.
‐ Maya,

23:39.752 --> 23:41.712
she's a year younger
than us, like, chill.

23:41.712 --> 23:44.762
‐ Why is everyone
on Ume's side?

23:44.757 --> 23:49.507
Why is being Japanese special
on her and bad on me?

23:49.511 --> 23:51.261
Why?

23:51.263 --> 23:52.603
‐ Oh, my God,
I'm getting your mom.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.308
I'm getting your mom, Maya.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.476
I hate you.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.982
I really hate you.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.827
Ume.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.746
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.536
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, I don't mean it.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.500
Okay? I'm sorry.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.516
‐ I love you.

24:34.515 --> 24:37.095
What's going on?

24:42.564 --> 24:45.194
‐ I think they're okay.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.800
‐ Hey, Dad!

25:06.505 --> 25:08.585
Dad?

25:48.797 --> 25:50.047
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey, Dad.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.469
Hey.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.837
You know, there's nowhere
to lock up my bike

25:53.844 --> 25:55.184
outside of this frickin' place.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.559
‐ Oh, that sucks.
‐ Yeah.

25:56.555 --> 26:00.345
‐ Hey, did anyone call for me?
‐ Uh...

26:00.350 --> 26:01.770
no.

26:01.769 --> 26:04.059
Um, not that I know of.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.483
Oops.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.782
Sorry.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.355
Wow.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.649
What have you been doing
in here?

26:10.652 --> 26:13.572
‐ I just kind of unpacked
your kitchen stuff, so‐‐

26:13.572 --> 26:15.162
Yeah, the kitchen looks great.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.867
Thank you.
‐ You're welcome.

26:16.867 --> 26:19.077
‐ Spending some time
at your dad's house, huh?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.538
So does this mean

26:20.537 --> 26:22.287
that you're gonna
make it full‐time?

26:22.289 --> 26:24.249
‐ Um, maybe.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.579
I got a surprise for ya.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.594
You know, I think it's gonna
really move that meter

26:27.586 --> 26:29.546
to, uh, I love my dad the most.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.916
Nah, I'm just kidding.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.263
‐ The cheese and corn's
not melted,

26:32.257 --> 26:33.837
but I think it'll be fine.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.472
Um...

26:37.304 --> 26:38.724
Smells good.

26:43.352 --> 26:44.522
‐ Ow.
Dad‐‐

26:44.520 --> 26:45.900
Ta‐da!

26:45.896 --> 26:48.436
Da‐da‐da.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.650
What the fuck, Anna?

26:49.650 --> 26:50.860
‐ I know, I just‐‐
I thought‐‐

26:50.859 --> 26:52.779
‐ This is my new oven!
‐ I know, I'm sorry.

26:52.778 --> 26:53.898
I thought it was glass‐‐
‐ You know, you don't

26:53.904 --> 26:55.364
put plastic in an oven.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.454
What are you doing?

26:56.448 --> 26:57.568
‐ I thought it was glass‐‐
‐ God!

26:57.574 --> 26:58.954
Ugh.
‐ I'm sorry‐‐

26:58.951 --> 27:00.911
‐ That's why you don't do this
when I'm not here, okay?

27:00.911 --> 27:02.201
‐ Okay.
‐ Here, come on, move.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.624
Move, move, move.
‐ Okay.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.622
‐ You're only‐‐
‐ Okay!

27:04.623 --> 27:06.583
You're only 13.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.293
‐ I thought it was glass.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.128
I was just trying to help.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.883
Ugh.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.562
A hamster?

27:21.557 --> 27:23.557
‐ I‐‐I wanted
to get you something so that

27:23.559 --> 27:25.559
when you go back
to your mom's this week

27:25.561 --> 27:27.441
and I'm not with you, you‐‐

27:27.437 --> 27:28.897
you have someone
to keep you company.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.910
Anna, the phone.
‐ Okay, okay!

27:36.905 --> 27:38.115
Got it.

27:38.115 --> 27:39.365
Hi, you've reached the Kones.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.826
This is Anna speaking.
How can I help you?

27:41.827 --> 27:44.747
Yo, how can I help you?

27:44.746 --> 27:47.206
‐ Yo?
Oh, Steve?

27:47.207 --> 27:49.537
Yo.

27:49.543 --> 27:51.213
Things may come
to those who wait,

27:51.211 --> 27:54.131
but only the things left
by those who hustle.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.631
How you been?
‐ Busy.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.756
Ah!

28:02.389 --> 28:03.519
Nah!

28:13.609 --> 28:15.489
Fell.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.497
‐ Mm‐‐I don't know‐‐

28:25.495 --> 28:27.285
I don't know what that means.

28:28.457 --> 28:32.087
‐ No...
clothes.

28:32.085 --> 28:35.705
Um... hot.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.386
Yeah.

28:50.646 --> 28:55.066
‐ Mm, me too.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.657
Mm‐‐
