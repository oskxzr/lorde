Okay, so what really happened is...

303
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,743
Brandt asked to finger me,

304
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,580
and I was like, "can I bring Anna?"

305
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,156
'Cause I was scared,

306
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,121
and then we went into the closet

307
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,171
and he just, like, felt us up.

308
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,785

I know.

313
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,967
‐ someone once said I have alopecia,

314
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,715
but my hair is, like, so full.

315
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,087
‐ oh, my god. ‐ rumors are crazy.

316
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,473

‐ I know! It's so weird.

I heard you were, like, totally
obsessed with Brandt though.

321
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,520
And, like, you put hair in his locker

322
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,364
and, like, he almost
transferred schools

323
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,820
for a second 'cause you
scared him so bad.

324
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,990
‐ Gina: Stalker.

325
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,368
‐ that's not true! That's crazy.

326
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,526

‐ I don't like him.

328
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,408
I don't like assholes, you guys.

329
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,121
‐ I mean, girls do like assholes.

330
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,251
You can just admit it.

00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,707
‐ no, but Maya doesn't like assholes.

332
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,087
She‐‐she had a crush on Sam zablowski.

333
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,705
He's not an asshole. ‐ what?

334
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,591
Zablowski? ‐ you and Sam?

335
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,168
‐ Anna! I don't like Sam.

336
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,133
I just liked him for, like‐‐ ‐ not now!
Not now!

337
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,763
‐ I had a crush on him for, like, a day

338
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,970
and then I stopped.

339
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,180
God. ‐ that's right. You stopped.

340
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,389
‐ oh, my god, we should call him.

341
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,679
‐ I don't like him. Fine, call him.

342
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,272
I don't care. ‐ what's
his number then, Maya?

343
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,056
‐ I don't memorize it
'cause I don't like him.

344
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,520
‐ don't call him 'cause
she doesn't like him.

345
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,560
Wait, we should.

346
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:18,113
Does anyone know his number?

347
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,397

‐ what?

362
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,473
‐ they're just prank calling me.

363
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,471
They wanna know if I like Maya, or...

Yeah.

‐ was that funny, Maya?
Did you see bloody Mary?

‐ yes.

387
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:23,817
‐ are you actually mad, Maya?

388
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,026
- It was just a joke.
- Yeah.

389
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,315
‐ no. ‐ are you okay? What's wrong?

390
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,528
‐ Anna, I'm good. Anna, stop.

391
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,108
‐ oh, no. ‐ no, stop.

392
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,073
I thought it was funny. It's good.

393
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,663
That was really funny, you guys.

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,870
- ‐ are you sure?
- Yes.

395
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,159
Anna, stop asking me.

396
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,333
I'm fine.

397
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,543
What's her problem?

398
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,463
Honestly, I don't know.

399
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,706
‐ are you okay?

400
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,684
‐ yeah, no. I said it's really funny.

401
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,675
I liked it.

402
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,046
‐ I'm talking about Anna.

403
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,603
Like, I love her, like,

404
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,847
so much. ‐ yeah.

405
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,179
But she has the biggest mouth.

406
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,103
I can't believe she told
everyone about Sam.

407
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,152
‐ I mean, honestly, like‐‐ Maura: Yeah.

408
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,436
‐ I agree.

409
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:05,518
Like, physically, she has a huge mouth.

410
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,404
She can stick anything in it. ‐ what?

411
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,281
‐ like, even her entire fist.

412
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,448
‐ has she done that?

413
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:11,655
‐ yeah, but shh.

414
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,815
‐ ask Anna to do that right now.

415
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:17,873
‐ what? Did you say my name?

416
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,290
Yeah. ‐ nothing.

417
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,538
‐ Anna, truth.

418
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,329
Can you stick your entire
fist in your mouth?

419
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,132
Maya said you could. ‐ Maya!

420
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,586
‐ in a funny way, though, I said.

421
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,336
Like, you do it as a joke.

422
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,087
‐ wait, Anna, actually do it.

423
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,089
Do it, do it, do it...

424
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,802
‐ she doesn't have to.
You don't have to.

425
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,432
- Do it.
- Do it, do it.

426
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,930
Seriously, that's disgusting.

427
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,231
‐ oh, my god! Ew!

428
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,227
‐ ugh, there's, like,
saliva all over that.

429
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,148
‐ I know. ‐ oh, my god, you guys.

430
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,607
Gina's already asleep.

431
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,438
‐ she's so tired.

432
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,613
- ‐ it's so early.
- ‐ Gina!

433
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,912
Gina! Arise!

434
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,946
‐ oh, my gosh, you guys, seriously!

435
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,119
I have to sleep.

436
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,947
‐ it wasn't me. It was Maura.

437
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,252
‐ Gina, Gina, Gina, Gina.

438
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,325
Gina, Gina, Gina, Gina. ‐ Maya, stop!

439
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,621
My meet's in, like, four hours. ‐ Gina!

440
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,004
‐ wake up for an hour for my meet.

441
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,380
I'm sorry! ‐ okay, okay, okay.

442
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,246
Shut up. Shut up. Everybody shut up.

443
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,133
Listen. Here's the deal.

444
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,880
Next person who falls asleep is out.

445
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,304
‐ not it. ‐ not it.

446
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,602
‐ not it! ‐ not it.

447
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,732
‐

448
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,068
‐ mm.

449
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,502
‐ she's out.

450
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,998
Sharpie her.

451
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,382
Do it.

452
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,644
‐ shh.

453
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,727
<i>‐</i>

454
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,606
‐ what's the farthest you've gone?

455
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,289
‐ haven't found the lucky lady.

456
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,746
You?

457
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,955
‐ uh, I just got a handy last summer.

458
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,457
‐ you never told me that.

459
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,958
‐ burned my dick off.

460
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,051
Lotion, my friend.

461
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,586
‐ hmm. Good to know.

462
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,993
‐

463
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:26,732
‐

464
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,322
‐ what is going‐‐maya!

465
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,648
‐ Sorry!

466
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,033
‐ what are you doing? ‐

467
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,570
‐ what are you‐‐ my sleeping bag's wet.

468
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,033
What the hell?

469
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,413
‐ don't be so sensitive.

470
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,989
We're doing it to everyone.

471
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,124
‐ I'm not sensitive.

472
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,750
You're the most sensitive person here.

473
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,627
‐ oh, my god. Sorry.

474
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,205
You were leaving me out all night.

475
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,630
You left me in a bag. Maybe
that's why I'm sensitive.

476
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,509
‐ that wasn't on purpose. Oh, my god.

477
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,086
Are you kidding? ‐ oh, my god.

478
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,761
‐ you leave me out all the time.

479
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,259
And you got my bag wet.

480
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
‐ sorry.

481
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,601
That was Maura's idea, not mine.

482
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,596
Sorry. ‐ oh, was it Maura's idea?

483
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,717
Yeah! ‐ where is she?

484
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,063
‐ you literally are obsessed with her.

485
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,938
‐ are you kidding? Wow.
‐ oh, my god, whatever.

486
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,146
Oh, my god, Maura.

487
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,024
‐ she's asleep.

488
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,074
‐ she's out.

489
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,527
‐ She's out.

490
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,702
‐ Maya, shh.

491
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,076
‐

492
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,884
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

493
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,297
‐ she sleeps with her eyes open.

494
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,303
‐ ew.

495
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,509
My god.

496
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,854
So weird.

497
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,427
‐ do you love Maura more than me?

498
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,603
Be honest.

499
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,190
‐ Maya.

500
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,895
Obviously not.

501
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,356
She's here.

502
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,976
You're here, but above the heavens.

503
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,614
‐ I mean, for me, she's
below the ground

504
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,071
and you're, like, up here.

505
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,201
‐ that's what I'm saying. Same.

506
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,527
Under. ‐ swear?

507
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,202
‐ swear.

508
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,998
I love you.

509
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,752
- ‐ yeah, let's go to bed.
- In your bag?

510
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,879
‐ yeah.

511
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,836
‐ are you sure‐‐ are you
sure you don't mind?

512
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,246
‐ yeah, no, I'm good.

513
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,054
Hey, Anna.

514
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:27,011
‐ yeah?

515
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,932
‐ the last ones out, aren't we?

516
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,599
‐ yeah.

517
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,480
Do you want me to rub your back?

518
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,769
‐ no, it tickles.

519
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,783
Oh, my back, okay, yeah.

520
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,111
Can you do the long scratches?

521
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,585
‐

522
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:33,198
You guys!

523
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,253
Wake up!

524
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,656
‐ oh, my god.

525
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,924
Somebody clogged the toilet

526
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,955
and it's brand‐new and super expensive.

527
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,039
‐ what?

528
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,633
Somebody clogged the toilet

529
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,298
and it's brand‐new and super expensive.

530
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,546
- Who was it?
- God.

531
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,760
‐ she's right.

532
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,854
There's a weird pad in there,

533
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,479
so whoever left it has their period.

534
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,352
‐ not it. Not it.

535
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,233
‐ definitely not it.

536
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,230
‐ I bet it's Maya.

537
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,861
‐ What?

538
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,528
‐ I mean, you did go in there last.

539
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,606
‐ it wasn't Maya

540
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,990
'cause we don't have our periods yet.

541
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,487
‐ yeah. We don't.

542
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,028
‐ I mean, Maya, if it was
you, it's totally fine.

543
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,532
We just need to know so we can fix it.

544
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,624
‐ okay, but it's not me
'cause I don't have it,

545
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,210
but what if it was like, Santa came

546
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,415
and, like, literally bled on a pad

547
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,286
and, like, put it in the toilet.

548
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,843
‐ nah, I'm pretty sure it was you.

549
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,376
‐ I don't have my period! Stop.

550
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,550
- ‐ it obviously was though!
- Oh, my god.

551
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,219
Maura, you're being crazy actually.

552
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,217
Stop. ‐ you guys, she
wants her privacy.

553
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,679
‐ guys, stop.

554
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,719
You're being crazy! Stop!

555
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,274
‐ uh, Maura? Your foot's bleeding.

556
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,148
‐ what?

557
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,265
Wait, what?

558
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,652
- Oh, my god!
- Ew!

559
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,778
Ew! Ew! Ew!

560
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,989
‐ ew!

561
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,029
Ew!

562
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,953
‐ is that what you do for a pad?

563
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,291
That's disgusting!

564
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,286
Oh, my god, what is that?

565
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,748
‐ stop.

566
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:02,247
‐ stop!

567
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,340
Okay, you guys are being really mean!

568
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,706
Stop!

569
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,922
Oh, my god! Stop it!

570
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,021
‐ what?

571
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,562
‐ my blood.

572
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,362
‐ fucking knew it.

573
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,653
Why would you lie to Anna?

574
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,322
That's so fucked up.

575
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,490
‐ I'm not.

576
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,158
‐ come here.

577
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,566
‐ it's gonna be okay, Anna.

578
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,334
It's okay.

579
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,326
‐ Anna, I'm sorry.

580
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,748
‐ I didn't‐‐

581
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,290
I'm so sorry.

582
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,753
That's so fucked up.
We're here for you.

583
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,054
- ‐ we're your friends.
- We love you, Anna.

584
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,375
<i>Hello?</i> ‐ hey, mom.

585
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,554
<i>Maya?</i>

586
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,932
‐ yeah, I'm sorry for calling so late.

587
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,180
<i>What‐‐what's wrong?</i>

588
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,812
‐ nothing. Can you
just come pick me up?

589
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,100
Please?

590
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,733
<i>What's going on?</i>

591
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,609
‐ nothing. I just wanna come home.

592
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,859
<i>Everyone thinks I'm a liar.</i>

593
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,664
‐ no, you're not a liar.

594
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,709
You know, privacy's
different than secret.

595
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,865
‐ no, I know,

596
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,042
but Anna asked and I lied to her

597
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,671
and I feel like...

598
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,709
I don't know, I, like,
clogged Maura's toilet

599
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,723
and everyone thinks I'm disgusting now.

600
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,965
‐ oh, you‐‐listen to me, Maya.

601
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,007
Girls or women are like salad bowls.

602
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,012
You know?

603
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,773
You put everything in one bowl.

604
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,635
Um, like this one here?

605
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,353
This is your...

606
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,306
‐

607
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:48,983
What? It's not funny.

608
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,482
It's‐‐it's beautiful.

609
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,783
No, I hate it. ‐ it's
a little cute wonder.

610
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,157
And... Ooh, who's that?

611
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,195
What's in here?

612
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,367
Ooh, this is Anna.

613
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,366
You cherish it and keep it.

614
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,079
And you only get to keep
what's most important to you.

615
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,421
Okay?

616
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,746
Because there's not much
room in the salad bowl.

617
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,752
Okay?

618
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,470
What's that?

619
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,755
- ‐ taking things off.
- Ah.

620
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,219
You have a lot of junk
in your bowl, huh?

621
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,972
Oh, what's that?

622
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,313
- ‐ Anna.
- Anna?

623
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,558
Ooh, it's nice.

624
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,850
Okay.

625
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,813
‐ stop taking it off my head.

626
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,613
You wanna keep it there? ‐ yeah.

627
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,277
You wanna keep Anna? ‐ yeah.

628
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,525
Ah, that's good.

629
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,107
‐ even if she hates me.

630
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,373
‐ I'm sure she doesn't.

631
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:44,202
She will come back.

632
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,504
‐ okay.

633
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,577
‐ yeah.

634
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,371
So let's just cherish it.

635
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:50,214
Let's keep it. Okay?

636
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,960
‐ mm‐hmm. ‐ hmm?

637
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,920
You're gonna be okay.

638
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,764
‐ okay. ‐ all right?

639
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,806
‐

640
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,807
Hmm?

641
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,388
‐ um, sorry, but I just‐‐

642
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:07,772
can I have $20?

643
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:12,189
'Cause, um, Bernard spent
it all on alcohol again.

644
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,150
‐ again? What a cunt.

645
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,362
‐ thanks.

646
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,540
It's kinda weird that
Maya's not here, no?

647
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,746
‐ I mean, like, it'd be
weirder if she was here.

648
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,577
Like, I don't know how
you forgive someone

649
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,002
after lying to you like that.

650
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,960
‐ yeah.

651
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,211
‐ Maya moved to Arizona.

652
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,974
‐ mm.

653
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,047
Yeah.

654
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,435
Bernard.

655
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:53,187
Bernard.

656
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,729
You just always lie to me.

657
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,902
‐ don't cry. Don't cry.

658
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,241
You want milk, baby?

659
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,372
Milk.

660
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,627
‐

661
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,975
Oh, my god.

662
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,994
Oh, my god.

663
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,160
Tonia.

664
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,165
Hey.

665
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,263
- ‐ hey. You got your milk?
- Yeah.

666
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,718
Uh, can I have my wallet back now?

667
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,719
‐ oh, yeah. Thanks. I
just borrowed the...

668
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,352
Yeah.

669
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,560
‐ your baby needs you.

670
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,151
Shh. ‐ mm‐hmm.

671
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,606
Mom.

672
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,436
Mom, could you, like, come up here?

673
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,192
‐ Maura...

674
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:26,737
You said that she was, like, a doctor.

675
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,991
But she's in a body spray ad.

676
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,703
‐ um, can I just have this back?

677
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,374
‐ well, I'm just using it.

678
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,043
‐ Anna. ‐ what?

679
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,501
Right? I mean, you lied. ‐ can I just‐‐

680
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,212
‐ you can just say it. ‐ can I just‐‐

681
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,382
can I just‐‐ give it back please.

682
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,971
‐ no. ‐ Anna.

683
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,796
It's mine.

684
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,141
Mom! Mommy?

685
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,216
Anna.

686
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,811
- Anna, it's mine.
- No.

687
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,096
It's mine! ‐ no.

688
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,979
‐ give it back. ‐ no, you give it back!

689
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,846
‐ no. Mom!

690
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,402
Hey, it's mine.

691
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,606
I'm just gonna‐‐ just let me‐‐ stop.

692
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,856
- Stop.
- Give it back!

693
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,147
- ‐ Maura.
- It's mine!

694
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,740
- Come on! It's mine!
- Maura, no.

695
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,815
- It's mine! Anna!
- No, no, no!

696
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,201
Anna! ‐ just go.

697
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,985
Just‐‐ Maura: No! Mom!

698
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,373
- Mom, no!
- Shh.

699
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,619
It's okay. Calm down.

700
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,040
‐ no! Anna!

701
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,919
Give it‐‐anna!

702
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,126
No, mom, it's mine!

703
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,591
‐ come on. ‐ mom, no!

704
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:23,417
- Sweetheart, calm.
- Mom.

705
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,883
Just calm.

706
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:25,932
Calm. Just breathe.

707
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,385
Anna!

708
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,795
That's why I said four
about her, on the phone.

709
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,014
I knew she was not right.

710
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,644
You always know before me.

711
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,930
Like, I'm too trusting.

712
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,313
- I'm too trusting.
- My mom knew too.

713
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:36,639
And Gina. ‐ I know.

714
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,274
None of them are her real friends.

715
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,571
‐ I knew it. I freaking knew it!

716
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,775
‐ no. Duh. She's a liar.

717
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:46,235
‐ no, I know, but I am too.

718
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:50,117
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about my period, but...

719
00:31:52,326 --> 00:31:54,576
I guess you don't like
me either right now.

720
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,669
‐ honestly, it's something about me.

721
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,205
Like, I just attract liars.

722
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,379
Something that says, like,
you can't trust me.

723
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,628
‐ Anna, it's not always about you.

724
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,550
It's my freaking period!

725
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,589
Like, it was a big
deal and I was like‐‐

726
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,553
I thought it was small
and it would go away,

727
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,813
but it, like‐‐it didn't.

728
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,675
Just comes once a month.

729
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,892
‐ no, you're right.
That's really intense.

730
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,143
‐ it is.

731
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,984
‐ I'm sorry, and I'm
really so happy for you.

732
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,571
My best friend's a woman.

733
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,566
‐ no, I don't wanna be.

734
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,698
‐ why?

735
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,985
‐ I don't know, I guess I'm
just, like, a salad bowl

736
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,029
like every other woman.

737
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,332
‐ mm.

738
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,575
Mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm.

739
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,656
‐ yeah.

740
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,450
Like mushy carrots, you know?

741
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,834
‐ just promise no more secrets.

742
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,870
‐ never. ‐ okay?

743
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,423
- ‐ I swear.
- Swear.

744
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,576
‐ swear. ‐ swear.

745
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,548
Except I did throw away
one of your library books

746
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,299
'cause I spilled sprite on it.

747
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,841
‐ Maya, that could affect my credit.

748
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,764
‐ I know. Sorry.

749
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,393
And also, when you're not around,

750
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:56,639
I go through your underwear drawer

751
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,731
and try on every pair
with flowers on them.

752
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,107
‐ over or under yours?

753
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,395
‐ under. ‐

754
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:06,148
‐ also, I drew that goatee on your face

755
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,820
and there's still a
little bit on there.

756
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,070
‐ you did that? ‐ yeah.

757
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,451
I also joined wrestling
because of Brandt,

758
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,078
not 'cause I wanted to
be a strong wrestler.

759
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,235
Also when my mom buys potatoes,
I put them in my shirt

760
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,754
and I walk around like this with boobs.

761
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,285
Also I have a book of crushes
and one of them is your dad.

762
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,869
‐ ew, Maya! ‐ I just‐‐

763
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,754
also I sometimes touch
myself down there

764
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,131
in a way that I told you about,

765
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,298
but in a different
way, not for comfort.

766
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,916
<i>I have a secret screen name
where I talk to old men,</i>

767
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,804
<i>and I'm talking to one right now.</i>

768
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,011
<i>I also shave my mustache sometimes.</i>

769
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,561
<i>- Shuji's my half brother.
- What?</i>

770
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,926
<i>But we're basically full.</i>

771
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,772
<i>That's probably it.</i>

772
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,397
‐ I got a pencil mark
on your bed cover once.

773
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,975
It was about this big,
and I didn't tell you.

774
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,320
‐ Anna! ‐ that has been killing me.

775
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,685
‐ why would you do
that and not tell me?

776
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,533
‐ I feel so much better.

777
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,868
‐ ugh, that's, like, kind of annoying.
