have not done a truth.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.330

12:28.080 --> 12:29.290

Were you really desperate?

Okay, so what really happened is...

13:00.863 --> 13:02.743
Brandt asked to finger me,

13:02.740 --> 13:05.580
and I was like, "can I bring Anna?"

13:05.576 --> 13:07.156
'Cause I was scared,

13:07.161 --> 13:09.121
and then we went into the closet

13:09.121 --> 13:11.171
and he just, like, felt us up.

‐ oh, my god. ‐ rumors are crazy.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.982
I heard you were, like, totally
obsessed with Brandt though.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.520
And, like, you put hair in his locker

13:37.524 --> 13:39.364
and, like, he almost
transferred schools

13:39.360 --> 13:41.820
for a second 'cause you
scared him so bad.

‐ I mean, girls do like assholes.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.251
You can just admit it.

13:52.247 --> 13:53.707
‐ no, but Maya doesn't like assholes.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.087
She‐‐she had a crush on Sam zablowski.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.705
He's not an asshole. ‐ what?

13:57.711 --> 13:59.591

I don't care. ‐ what's
his number then, Maya?

14:11.266 --> 14:13.056
‐ I don't memorize it
'cause I don't like him.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.520
‐ don't call him 'cause
she doesn't like him.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.560
Wait, we should.

14:16.563 --> 14:18.113
Does anyone know his number?

14:18.107 --> 14:19.397
‐ I want in. ‐ I don't like
him so I don't care. Call.

‐ sorry.

21:03.261 --> 21:04.601
That was Maura's idea, not mine.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.596
Sorry. ‐ oh, was it Maura's idea?

21:05.597 --> 21:06.717
Yeah! ‐ where is she?

21:06.723 --> 21:08.063
‐ you literally are obsessed with her.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.938
‐ are you kidding? Wow.
‐ oh, my god, whatever.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.146
Oh, my god, Maura.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.024
‐ she's asleep.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.074
‐ she's out.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.527
‐ She's out.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.702
‐ Maya, shh.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.076
‐

21:34.084 --> 21:35.884
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

21:35.877 --> 21:37.297
‐ she sleeps with her eyes open.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.303
‐ ew.

21:41.299 --> 21:42.509
My god.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.854
So weird.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.427
‐ do you love Maura more than me?

21:49.433 --> 21:50.603
Be honest.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.190
‐ Maya.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.895
Obviously not.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.356
She's here.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.976
You're here, but above the heavens.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.614
‐ I mean, for me, she's
below the ground

22:01.611 --> 22:03.071
and you're, like, up here.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.201
‐ that's what I'm saying. Same.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.527
Under. ‐ swear?

22:05.532 --> 22:08.202
‐ swear.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.998
I love you.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.752
- ‐ yeah, let's go to bed.
- In your bag?

22:13.749 --> 22:15.879
‐ yeah.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.836
‐ are you sure‐‐ are you
sure you don't mind?

22:17.836 --> 22:19.246
‐ yeah, no, I'm good.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.054
Hey, Anna.

22:25.051 --> 22:27.011
‐ yeah?

22:27.012 --> 22:28.932
‐ the last ones out, aren't we?

22:30.849 --> 22:32.599
‐ yeah.

22:34.060 --> 22:35.480
Do you want me to rub your back?

22:35.479 --> 22:37.769
‐ no, it tickles.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.783
Oh, my back, okay, yeah.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.111
Can you do the long scratches?

23:03.965 --> 23:05.585
‐

23:32.118 --> 23:33.198
You guys!

23:33.203 --> 23:34.253
Wake up!

23:34.246 --> 23:35.656
‐ oh, my god.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.924
Somebody clogged the toilet

23:36.915 --> 23:38.955
and it's brand‐new and super expensive.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.039
‐ what?

23:40.043 --> 23:41.633
Somebody clogged the toilet

23:41.628 --> 23:43.298
and it's brand‐new and super expensive.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.546
- Who was it?
- God.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.760
‐ she's right.

23:52.764 --> 23:53.854
There's a weird pad in there,

23:53.849 --> 23:55.479
so whoever left it has their period.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.352
‐ not it. Not it.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.233
‐ definitely not it.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.230
‐ I bet it's Maya.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.861
‐ What?

24:02.858 --> 24:04.528
‐ I mean, you did go in there last.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.606
‐ it wasn't Maya

24:05.610 --> 24:06.990
'cause we don't have our periods yet.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.487
‐ yeah. We don't.

24:08.488 --> 24:11.028
‐ I mean, Maya, if it was
you, it's totally fine.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.532
We just need to know so we can fix it.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.624
‐ okay, but it's not me
'cause I don't have it,

24:15.620 --> 24:17.210
but what if it was like, Santa came

24:17.205 --> 24:19.415
and, like, literally bled on a pad

24:19.416 --> 24:21.286
and, like, put it in the toilet.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.843
‐ nah, I'm pretty sure it was you.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.376
‐ I don't have my period! Stop.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.550
- ‐ it obviously was though!
- Oh, my god.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.219
Maura, you're being crazy actually.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.217
Stop. ‐ you guys, she
wants her privacy.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.679
‐ guys, stop.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.719
You're being crazy! Stop!

24:35.724 --> 24:38.274
‐ uh, Maura? Your foot's bleeding.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.148
‐ what?

24:40.145 --> 24:42.265
Wait, what?

24:42.272 --> 24:43.652
- Oh, my god!
- Ew!

24:43.648 --> 24:46.778
Ew! Ew! Ew!

24:49.779 --> 24:50.989
‐ ew!

24:50.989 --> 24:53.029
Ew!

24:53.033 --> 24:54.953
‐ is that what you do for a pad?

24:54.951 --> 24:56.291
That's disgusting!

24:56.286 --> 24:58.286
Oh, my god, what is that?

24:58.288 --> 24:59.748
‐ stop.

25:01.207 --> 25:02.247
‐ stop!

25:02.250 --> 25:04.340
Okay, you guys are being really mean!

25:04.336 --> 25:05.706
Stop!

25:05.712 --> 25:07.922
Oh, my god! Stop it!

25:16.681 --> 25:18.021
‐ what?

25:20.852 --> 25:22.562
‐ my blood.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.362
‐ fucking knew it.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.653
Why would you lie to Anna?

25:28.652 --> 25:30.322
That's so fucked up.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.490
‐ I'm not.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.158
‐ come here.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.566
‐ it's gonna be okay, Anna.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.334
It's okay.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.326
‐ Anna, I'm sorry.

25:40.038 --> 25:43.748
‐ I didn't‐‐

25:43.750 --> 25:45.290
I'm so sorry.

25:45.293 --> 25:47.753
That's so fucked up.
We're here for you.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.054
- ‐ we're your friends.
- We love you, Anna.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.375
<i>Hello?</i> ‐ hey, mom.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.554
<i>Maya?</i>

25:54.552 --> 25:56.932
‐ yeah, I'm sorry for calling so late.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.180
<i>What‐‐what's wrong?</i>

25:59.182 --> 26:01.812
‐ nothing. Can you
just come pick me up?

26:01.810 --> 26:03.100
Please?

26:03.103 --> 26:04.733
<i>What's going on?</i>

26:04.729 --> 26:07.609
‐ nothing. I just wanna come home.

26:13.029 --> 26:14.859
<i>Everyone thinks I'm a liar.</i>

26:14.864 --> 26:17.664
‐ no, you're not a liar.

26:17.659 --> 26:21.709
You know, privacy's
different than secret.

26:21.705 --> 26:22.865
‐ no, I know,

26:22.872 --> 26:25.042
but Anna asked and I lied to her

26:25.041 --> 26:27.671
and I feel like...

26:27.669 --> 26:29.709
I don't know, I, like,
clogged Maura's toilet

26:29.713 --> 26:31.723
and everyone thinks I'm disgusting now.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.965
‐ oh, you‐‐listen to me, Maya.

26:33.967 --> 26:37.007
Girls or women are like salad bowls.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.012
You know?

26:38.013 --> 26:40.773
You put everything in one bowl.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.635
Um, like this one here?

26:43.643 --> 26:45.353
This is your...

26:46.146 --> 26:47.306
‐

26:47.313 --> 26:48.983
What? It's not funny.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.482
It's‐‐it's beautiful.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.783
No, I hate it. ‐ it's
a little cute wonder.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.157
And... Ooh, who's that?

26:55.155 --> 26:56.195
What's in here?

26:56.197 --> 26:58.367
Ooh, this is Anna.

26:58.366 --> 27:01.366
You cherish it and keep it.

27:01.369 --> 27:05.079
And you only get to keep
what's most important to you.

27:05.081 --> 27:06.421
Okay?

27:06.416 --> 27:08.746
Because there's not much
room in the salad bowl.

27:08.752 --> 27:09.752
Okay?

27:12.130 --> 27:13.470
What's that?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.755
- ‐ taking things off.
- Ah.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.219
You have a lot of junk
in your bowl, huh?

27:20.472 --> 27:21.972
Oh, what's that?

27:21.973 --> 27:23.313
- ‐ Anna.
- Anna?

27:23.308 --> 27:25.558
Ooh, it's nice.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.850
Okay.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.813
‐ stop taking it off my head.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.613
You wanna keep it there? ‐ yeah.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.277
You wanna keep Anna? ‐ yeah.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.525
Ah, that's good.

27:34.527 --> 27:37.107
‐ even if she hates me.

27:37.113 --> 27:39.373
‐ I'm sure she doesn't.

27:40.742 --> 27:44.202
She will come back.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.504
‐ okay.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.577
‐ yeah.

27:46.581 --> 27:48.371
So let's just cherish it.

27:48.374 --> 27:50.214
Let's keep it. Okay?

27:50.210 --> 27:51.960
‐ mm‐hmm. ‐ hmm?

27:53.880 --> 27:55.920
You're gonna be okay.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.764
‐ okay. ‐ all right?

28:01.596 --> 28:03.806
‐

28:03.807 --> 28:04.807
Hmm?

28:04.808 --> 28:06.388
‐ um, sorry, but I just‐‐

28:06.392 --> 28:07.772
can I have $20?

28:07.769 --> 28:12.189
'Cause, um, Bernard spent
it all on alcohol again.

28:12.190 --> 28:16.150
‐ again? What a cunt.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.362
‐ thanks.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.540
It's kinda weird that
Maya's not here, no?

28:24.536 --> 28:27.746
‐ I mean, like, it'd be
weirder if she was here.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.577
Like, I don't know how
you forgive someone

28:29.582 --> 28:31.002
after lying to you like that.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.960
‐ yeah.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.211
‐ Maya moved to Arizona.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.974
‐ mm.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.047
Yeah.

28:48.935 --> 28:51.435
Bernard.

28:51.437 --> 28:53.187
Bernard.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.729
You just always lie to me.

28:54.732 --> 28:56.902
‐ don't cry. Don't cry.

28:58.361 --> 29:00.241
You want milk, baby?

29:02.782 --> 29:04.372
Milk.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.627
‐

29:35.565 --> 29:36.975
Oh, my god.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.994
Oh, my god.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.160
Tonia.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.165
Hey.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.263
- ‐ hey. You got your milk?
- Yeah.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.718
Uh, can I have my wallet back now?

30:04.719 --> 30:07.719
‐ oh, yeah. Thanks. I
just borrowed the...

30:07.722 --> 30:09.352
Yeah.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.560
‐ your baby needs you.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.151
Shh. ‐ mm‐hmm.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.606
Mom.

30:16.606 --> 30:19.436
Mom, could you, like, come up here?

30:19.442 --> 30:21.192
‐ Maura...

30:23.237 --> 30:26.737
You said that she was, like, a doctor.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.991
But she's in a body spray ad.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.703
‐ um, can I just have this back?

30:31.704 --> 30:33.374
‐ well, I'm just using it.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.043
‐ Anna. ‐ what?

30:35.041 --> 30:37.501
Right? I mean, you lied. ‐ can I just‐‐

30:37.502 --> 30:39.212
‐ you can just say it. ‐ can I just‐‐

30:39.212 --> 30:41.382
can I just‐‐ give it back please.

30:41.381 --> 30:42.971
‐ no. ‐ Anna.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.796
It's mine.

30:44.801 --> 30:47.141
Mom! Mommy?

30:47.136 --> 30:48.216
Anna.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.811
- Anna, it's mine.
- No.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.096
It's mine! ‐ no.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.979
‐ give it back. ‐ no, you give it back!

30:52.976 --> 30:54.846
‐ no. Mom!

30:54.852 --> 30:56.402
Hey, it's mine.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.606
I'm just gonna‐‐ just let me‐‐ stop.

30:58.606 --> 30:59.856
- Stop.
- Give it back!

30:59.857 --> 31:01.147
- ‐ Maura.
- It's mine!

31:01.150 --> 31:02.740
- Come on! It's mine!
- Maura, no.

31:02.735 --> 31:04.815
- It's mine! Anna!
- No, no, no!

31:04.821 --> 31:06.201
Anna! ‐ just go.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.985
Just‐‐ Maura: No! Mom!

31:09.993 --> 31:11.373
- Mom, no!
- Shh.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.619
It's okay. Calm down.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.040
‐ no! Anna!

31:15.039 --> 31:16.919
Give it‐‐anna!

31:16.916 --> 31:19.126
No, mom, it's mine!

31:20.461 --> 31:21.591
‐ come on. ‐ mom, no!

31:21.587 --> 31:23.417
- Sweetheart, calm.
- Mom.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.883
Just calm.

31:24.882 --> 31:25.932
Calm. Just breathe.

31:25.925 --> 31:27.385
Anna!

31:27.385 --> 31:29.795
That's why I said four
about her, on the phone.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.014
I knew she was not right.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.644
You always know before me.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.930
Like, I'm too trusting.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.313
- I'm too trusting.
- My mom knew too.

31:35.309 --> 31:36.639
And Gina. ‐ I know.

31:36.644 --> 31:38.274
None of them are her real friends.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.571
‐ I knew it. I freaking knew it!

31:40.565 --> 31:42.775
‐ no. Duh. She's a liar.

31:42.775 --> 31:46.235
‐ no, I know, but I am too.

31:46.237 --> 31:50.117
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about my period, but...

31:52.326 --> 31:54.576
I guess you don't like
me either right now.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.669
‐ honestly, it's something about me.

31:57.665 --> 32:00.205
Like, I just attract liars.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.379
Something that says, like,
you can't trust me.

32:02.378 --> 32:04.628
‐ Anna, it's not always about you.

32:04.630 --> 32:06.550
It's my freaking period!

32:06.549 --> 32:08.589
Like, it was a big
deal and I was like‐‐

32:08.593 --> 32:10.553
I thought it was small
and it would go away,

32:10.553 --> 32:12.813
but it, like‐‐it didn't.

32:12.805 --> 32:14.675
Just comes once a month.

32:14.682 --> 32:16.892
‐ no, you're right.
That's really intense.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.143
‐ it is.

32:18.144 --> 32:21.984
‐ I'm sorry, and I'm
really so happy for you.

32:21.981 --> 32:23.571
My best friend's a woman.

32:23.566 --> 32:25.566
‐ no, I don't wanna be.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.698
‐ why?

32:27.695 --> 32:29.985
‐ I don't know, I guess I'm
just, like, a salad bowl

32:29.989 --> 32:31.029
like every other woman.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.332
‐ mm.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.575
Mm‐hmm, mm‐hmm.

32:33.576 --> 32:34.656
‐ yeah.

32:34.660 --> 32:36.450
Like mushy carrots, you know?

32:36.454 --> 32:37.834
‐ just promise no more secrets.

32:37.830 --> 32:38.870
‐ never. ‐ okay?

32:38.873 --> 32:40.423
- ‐ I swear.
- Swear.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.576
‐ swear. ‐ swear.

32:45.088 --> 32:48.548
Except I did throw away
one of your library books

32:48.549 --> 32:50.299
'cause I spilled sprite on it.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.841
‐ Maya, that could affect my credit.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.764
‐ I know. Sorry.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.393
And also, when you're not around,

32:55.389 --> 32:56.639
I go through your underwear drawer

32:56.641 --> 32:59.731
and try on every pair
with flowers on them.

32:59.727 --> 33:02.107
‐ over or under yours?

33:02.105 --> 33:04.395
‐ under. ‐

33:04.398 --> 33:06.148
‐ also, I drew that goatee on your face

33:06.150 --> 33:08.820
and there's still a
little bit on there.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.070
‐ you did that? ‐ yeah.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.451
I also joined wrestling
because of Brandt,

33:12.448 --> 33:14.078
not 'cause I wanted to
be a strong wrestler.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.235
Also when my mom buys potatoes,
I put them in my shirt

33:16.244 --> 33:17.754
and I walk around like this with boobs.

33:17.745 --> 33:20.285
Also I have a book of crushes
and one of them is your dad.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.869
‐ ew, Maya! ‐ I just‐‐

33:21.874 --> 33:23.754
also I sometimes touch
myself down there

33:23.751 --> 33:25.131
in a way that I told you about,

33:25.128 --> 33:27.298
but in a different
way, not for comfort.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.916
<i>I have a secret screen name
where I talk to old men,</i>

33:29.924 --> 33:31.804
<i>and I'm talking to one right now.</i>

33:31.801 --> 33:34.011
<i>I also shave my mustache sometimes.</i>

33:34.011 --> 33:36.561
<i>- Shuji's my half brother.
- What?</i>

33:36.556 --> 33:37.926
<i>But we're basically full.</i>

33:37.932 --> 33:39.772
<i>That's probably it.</i>

33:39.767 --> 33:42.397
‐ I got a pencil mark
on your bed cover once.

33:42.395 --> 33:43.975
It was about this big,
and I didn't tell you.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.320
‐ Anna! ‐ that has been killing me.

33:46.315 --> 33:48.685
‐ why would you do
that and not tell me?

33:48.693 --> 33:50.533
‐ I feel so much better.

33:50.528 --> 33:53.868
‐ ugh, that's, like, kind of annoying.
