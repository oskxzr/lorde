'cause I spilled Sprite on it.

873
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,841
‐ Maya, that could affect
my credit.

874
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,764
‐ I know.
Sorry.

875
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,393
And also,
when you're not around,

876
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:56,639
I go through
your underwear drawer

877
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,731
and try on every pair
with flowers on them.

878
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,107
‐ Over or under yours?

879
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,395
‐ Under.
‐ [groans]

880
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:06,148
‐ Also, I drew that goatee
on your face

881
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,820
and there's still a little bit
on there.

882
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,070
‐ You did that?
‐ Yeah.

883
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,451
I also joined wrestling
because of Brandt,

884
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,078
not 'cause I wanted to be
a strong wrestler.

885
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,235
Also when my mom buys potatoes,
I put them in my shirt

886
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,754
and I walk around like this
with boobs.

887
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,285
Also I have a book of crushes
and one of them is your dad.

888
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,869
‐ Ew, Maya!
‐ I just‐‐

889
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,754
Also I sometimes touch myself
down there

890
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,131
in a way that I told you about,

891
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,298
but in a different way,
not for comfort.

892
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,916
<i>I have a secret screen name</i>
<i>where I talk to old men,</i>

893
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,804
<i>and I'm talking to one</i>
<i>right now.</i>

894
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,011
<i>I also shave my mustache</i>
<i>sometimes.</i>

895
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,561
<i>Shuji's my half brother.</i>
<i>ANNA: What?</i>

896
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,926
<i>MAYA:</i>
<i>But we're basically full.</i>

897
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,772
<i>That's probably it.</i>

898
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,397
‐ I got a pencil mark
on your bed cover once.

899
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,975
It was about this big,
and I didn't tell you.

900
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,320
‐ Anna!
‐ That has been killing me.

901
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,685
‐ Why would you do that
and not tell me?

902
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,533
‐ I feel so much better.

903
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,868
‐ Ugh, that's, like,
kind of annoying.

904
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,525
