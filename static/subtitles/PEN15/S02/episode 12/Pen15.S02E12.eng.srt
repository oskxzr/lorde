1
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,434
‐ Driver.

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,558
Are we almost there?

3
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:22,358
Goal!

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,368
I

5
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:41,251
I am hiding

6
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,960
The you I show to you

7
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,761
Is just a lie

8
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,506
You take what you want

9
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,178
You get what you take

10
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,846
So high, high, high

11
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,977
‐ Right after that,
I snapped his headphones.

12
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,557
‐ Did your parents react?

13
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,771
‐ They stay out of it.
They don't really give a shit.

14
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,698
‐ Eager Anna.

15
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,867
‐ Thank you.
Um, I just wanted to say

16
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,235
that what you all
are going through

17
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,452
is intense but wonderful.

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,451
Kudos.

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,082
For me, I have a hamster,

20
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,749
and my Dad got it for me.

21
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,667
Its name is Daddy
'cause I named it that,

22
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,126
and I love it.

23
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:28,796
Couldn't help but feel like
maybe my Dad is just trying

24
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,837
to sweeten me up
by getting me the pet

25
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,391
because he wants me to live
with him, not with my mom.

26
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,595
‐ Yeah, wow,
y‐you don't have any problems

27
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,887
opening up and sharing, do you?

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,980
You remind me of my mailman.

29
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,226
‐ Thank you.

30
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,687
Um, and actually...

31
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,859
just going between
the two places‐‐

32
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,488
my mom's place
and my dad's place‐‐

33
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,276
it's hard,

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,530
and my mom is, like,
always late.

35
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,334
Always.

36
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,998
And my Dad is grumpier.

37
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,037
And he didn't get the house,

38
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,211
and I'm just like,
if he doesn't get me, too,

39
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,249
I don't know
what he's gonna do.

40
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,054
‐ You talk like you're 40,
kind of.

41
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,552
‐ Thank you.

42
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,090
And that's actually
a good thing,

43
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,603
because most people don't reach
their full potential

44
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,097
until they're at least 38.

45
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,519
‐ Oh, my goodness, it's time
for us to wrap it up.

46
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,229
Thank you for opening up
and sharing, everyone.

47
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,940
Get all your stuff.
Don't forget your shoes.

48
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,730
Oh, it's just my shoes.

49
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,284
Remember to breathe. Ciao!

50
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,745
‐ Thanks, Tina.
‐ See ya.

51
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,542
‐ What's up?

52
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,754
‐ Hey.

53
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,634
So, uh, you seeing the world

54
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,631
through
rose‐colored lenses now?

55
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,637
No, seriously, I don't get
what the point of it is

56
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,967
'cause, like, they just listen

57
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,732
and they, like, don't
give you advice, you know?

58
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,015
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

59
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,159
Basically, we
diagnose based on a spectrum,

60
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,619
and Maya happens to be
a little bit above average

61
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,792
on that spectrum.

62
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,035
Maya, do you have trouble
focusing?

63
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,964
‐ No, I'm actually
really smart.

64
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,673
‐ Oh, I know you're very smart.
That's not the issue.

65
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,684
Attention Deficit Disorder
is actually quite common,

66
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,597
and many of our patients
have found success

67
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,345
taking methylphenidate
hydrochloride.

68
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,057
‐ Medication for this?

69
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,477
‐ It is a stimulant,

70
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,055
but it actually
has the opposite effect

71
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,480
on kids who have ADD.

72
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,398
It helps them focus.

73
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,897
‐ Maya, then you just better
pay more attention.

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,400
‐ I do.
‐ That's all this is.

75
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,492
‐ Stop. Stop.
‐ No.

76
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,658
‐ You know,

77
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,986
Maya is jumping
off the walls like crazy.

78
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,492
And I love that about you,
darling, I do.

79
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,164
But not at school.

80
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,373
‐ And with every medication,
there are some side effects.

81
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,423
Most commonly,
increased heart rate.

82
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,957
But the benefits
do outweigh any discomfort.

83
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,091
‐ No, I don't wanna take
the medicine

84
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,088
if it's gonna
speed up my heart.

85
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,430
‐ Once you acknowledge
the problem,

86
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,886
she can have
extra time on tests

87
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,847
and other assistance that can
help Maya improve her scores.

88
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,518
‐ Extended time on testing?

89
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,226
‐ Yeah,
as much time as you need.

90
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,846
‐ We'll talk about it at home.

91
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,613
‐ I think I wanna take
the medicine.

92
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,685
‐ No.
‐ We'll talk about it.

93
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,569
‐ Mom, I wanna take it!

94
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,106
‐ Oh. Stop. Stop.

95
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,072
‐ Maya...

96
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,331
uh, how do you feel
about fluorescent lights?

97
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,293
‐ I don't feel good
about fluorescent lights.

98
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,963
‐ Anna.

99
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,424
Anna. Anna.

100
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,888
‐ Stop. What are you...

101
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,180
‐ Oh, just stare
at whatever you want.

102
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,641
Like, so stupid.

103
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,393
They're crazy.
‐ I know.

104
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,112
I like that, uh‐‐

105
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,938
I like when your mom's late.

106
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,154
‐ Oh, yeah?
‐ Which is, like, all the time.

107
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,164
I know.

108
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,155
‐ Ope.

109
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,464
‐ Hey.
‐ I know, I'm late.

110
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:35,958
Yeah.

111
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:36,961
‐ Who's that guy?

112
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,128
‐ Who are you talking about?

113
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,670
‐ Mr. Loser.
‐ There's no one there.

114
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,884
There's a guy
right there.

115
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,390
Doesn't even know
how to ride his bike.

116
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,386
‐ I don't know who that is.

117
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,507
He's in Teens in Need.

118
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,353
Okay.
Just get in the back.

119
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,938
‐ Irlen syndrome
is a light sensitivity

120
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,396
that can contribute
to reading difficulties,

121
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,477
headaches,
trouble concentrating.

122
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,440
But what can help...

123
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,321
Is wearing
these special glasses.

124
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,872
‐ Do I have to wear these
all day, like, every day?

125
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,463
‐ Well...

126
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,376
Look at Haley Joel Osment
on the red carpet.

127
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,050
He has Irlen syndrome.

128
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,428
He looks great. Very cool.

129
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,914
‐ I love it.

130
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,909
‐ And I know you want me
to do my own laundry.

131
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,409
‐ About that...

132
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,250
‐ But I'm just‐‐it's hard

133
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,365
with all the Teens in Need
and everything.

134
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,462
I can't have dirty underwear.

135
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,049
‐ Thank you.
‐ I got it.

136
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,705
But maybe, just maybe,

137
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,673
I've found someone
to help us with that.

138
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,343
‐ Maybe, just maybe, what?

139
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,552
Found someone to help.

140
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,431
‐ Found someone
to help us with that?

141
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,097
A maid?

142
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,478
Mom. A maid?

143
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,806
Surprise!

144
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,073
‐ Oh, you're late.

145
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,105
Huh.

146
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,398
‐ Grammy.

147
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,451
Oh, my. Oh, my.

148
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,316
Oh, and here I am
as a surprise.

149
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,294
I was going to help out
for the foreseeable future.

150
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,910
‐ How are you?
‐ Hello. Yeah.

151
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,673
You know, I keep telling you
this, and you don't listen.

152
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,076
You're slouching.

153
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,094
And if you continue to slouch,
you're going to get

154
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,586
one of those stomach pooches
just like your mother.

155
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,929
‐ Ha‐ha. Mom, stop.

156
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,175
‐ Oh, well.

157
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,676
I think I'm going to go
and make us some dinner.

158
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,969
Okay. Thanks, Grammy.

159
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,891
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Love you.

160
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,560
‐ Well, yes, thank you.

161
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,518
‐ Bring the groceries.

162
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,031
Near the volcano,

163
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,331
it is distinguished
by a network of cracks.

164
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,502
Where were you?

165
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,474
My Grammy
just moved in with us.

166
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,509
‐ What?
‐ Yeah.

167
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,353
‐ That's crazy.
‐ Yeah.

168
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,516
What? I love these.

169
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,265
‐ I have to wear them
'cause I have ADD

170
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,943
and Irlen syndrome.

171
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,191
And literally, like,
I have to take this medication

172
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,363
that can speed up
your heart rate and kill you.

173
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,242
‐ Wait, what?
‐ Yeah.

174
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,569
‐ Maya.
‐ I know.

175
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,077
‐ I can't lose you.
‐ I know.

176
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,997
‐ Shh. Girls. Movie.

177
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,167
And Maya, no Oakleys
in the classroom.

178
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,497
I actually have Irlen syndrome.

179
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,002
Um...

180
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,384
and I need to wear these
'cause they're prescribed.

181
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,841
So...yeah.

182
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,091
And I'm also supposed
to be on medication right now,

183
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,433
but I'm not on it.

184
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,598
So I'm just having, like,
a really hard day.

185
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,395
‐ Hey, Bowl Cut.
"The Matrix" called.

186
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,685
‐ Neo wants his glasses back.

187
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,149
Haley Joel Osment wears them.

188
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,494
So did you hear
from Steve's friend Derrick?

189
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,239
Did he call you?

190
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
‐ You mean the high schooler
that's gonna be my boyfriend?

191
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,582
‐ Yeah.
‐ No, he hasn't.

192
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,038
But I'm just kind of,
like, waiting.

193
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,538
I feel like any day now.
‐ Yeah.

194
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,829
When he does,
we're gonna go on double dates.

195
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,125
‐ Um...

196
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,798
wait, if your Grammy
is living with you,

197
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,467
does that mean I can still
sleep over tonight or no?

198
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,796
‐ Oh, my mom's gonna
take us to Blockbuster.

199
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,522
Shh!

200
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,556
Sorry.

201
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,687
She's such a bitch.

202
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,691
Hi, Mr. Corlado‐‐

203
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,952
Anna, stop.
‐ Stop.

204
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,739
Oh, my God.
Why is my mom honking?

205
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,621
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ What is she doing?

206
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,948
‐ Why is she doing that?

207
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,588
‐ Come on, come on.
Get in, get in.

208
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,417
Oh, hi, honey.
Come on in.

209
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,972
No, not there.
I have my oxygen tank.

210
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,927
‐ Wait, is that your Grammy?

211
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,259
‐ Yeah.
‐ Get in the backseat.

212
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,434
That's good.

213
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,681
‐ I didn't know you were
picking us up.

214
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,233
- Well...
- Hi.

215
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,686
‐ Well, no, Mom is very busy
with her "rackas" clients.

216
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,070
‐ It's reiki, but...

217
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,225
Racka, reiki, ra‐‐

218
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:55,824
Did you know‐‐did you know
that your mother went through

219
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,912
a whole year of her RN,

220
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,198
and then she met your Dad.

221
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,871
And we all know
how that worked out.

222
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,713
‐ Yeah.

223
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,010
‐ Is she blind?

224
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,965
‐ Um, hi, Grammy. I'm Maya.

225
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,836
‐ It's Mrs. Ryan.

226
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,434
‐ Um, Grammy,
can we go to Blockbuster?

227
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,599
'Cause my mom
was gonna take us.

228
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,522
‐ No.
‐ Sorry, Grammy?

229
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,517
Yeah?

230
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,598
‐ Um, you don't have to honk,

231
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,773
'cause it'll move.

232
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,480
‐ Don't tell me what to do.

233
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,317
If you learned how to type,

234
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,949
it meant you wanted
to be a secretary.

235
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:41,026
So we took Home Economics
so we could get a good husband.

236
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,206
Mom?

237
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,127
‐ Where are we going?
‐ This way.

238
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,130
‐ Thank you.

239
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,551
‐ Mom?

240
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,719
‐ You don't have to yell
so much.

241
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,758
I mean, you're a tall girl
with a tall voice to match.

242
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,024
Let's go.

243
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,556
‐ Sorry.

244
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,229
‐ You know, I still wanna
have my hair done today.

245
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,649
‐ Where do I put my stuff?

246
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,317
‐ Just wherever.
Maya, you've been here before.

247
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,485
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Maya, don't...yeah.

248
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,945
‐ It's, like, stuck.

249
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,275
‐ Yeah, yeah.

250
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,739
You know, you gotta watch
these things.

251
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,369
They're lethal.

252
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,986
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay. Okay.

253
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,214
It's stuck. Okay.
It's kinda hard to steer.

254
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,416
True.

255
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,035
‐ "Went out with Ramona.
Enjoy your movie."

256
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,007
‐ It's just us tonight.

257
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,971
‐ Well, let's take
a look at this.

258
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,182
Can we go to your room?

259
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,522
‐ Yeah. One sec.
‐ Oh, here it is.

260
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,978
Honey, would you please
call the salon for me?

261
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,269
I want to have
my hair done today‐‐

262
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,783
‐ Okay.
‐ With‐‐with Sheryl.

263
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,815
And do not let them
try to sell you on Theresa

264
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,991
because your mother tells me
she doesn't know one thing.

265
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,996
Yes.
Did Theresa do your hair?

266
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,959
‐ We're sorry,
La Moda Hair Salon

267
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,749
is currently closed.

268
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,052
‐ Uh, Grammy, they're closed.

269
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,916
‐ Well, call again.
Maybe you got the wrong number.

270
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,934
‐ I got the voicemail.
It's definitely them.

271
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,136
They're just closed,
but I can call again tomorrow.

272
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:28,307
‐ Well, if you hadn't been
lollywagging so much at school,

273
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,978
maybe we could have gotten here

274
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,396
and I could have gotten
my hair done.

275
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,435
You're just like your mother.

276
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,688
‐ Yeah.
‐ Sorry.

277
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,231
‐ Sorry, Grammy.
‐ Sorry, Grammy.

278
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,404
‐ Could you get me something
to drink with my pills dear?

279
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,704
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

280
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,157
‐ Okay, Grammy.
‐ Good.

281
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,197
No, no, no. Just you.

282
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,000
Come‐‐you come back, Maya.
Come back.

283
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,865
‐ Maya, she wants you.
‐ You can go alone.

284
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,082
You don't need Maya.

285
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,381
‐ Anna, wait.

286
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,455
‐ Oh, um, help.

287
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,631
‐ Do you need‐‐

288
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,878
‐ She's not gonna be gone
long, darling.

289
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,590
She's not gonna be‐‐
she'll be right back.

290
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,431
‐ Okay.
‐ I know that.

291
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,716
Yes.

292
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,849
‐ Sorry.

293
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,109
You know, I have ADD,
so I have to take pills too.

294
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,238
‐ You have ADD? Hmm.

295
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,083
Well, you know,
everyone only has

296
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,577
a certain amount of beats
in their lifetime.

297
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,080
‐ Really?

298
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,342
‐ That's why
I'm so very quiet and still.

299
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,705
‐ Oh, my God.

300
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,551
‐ I got you water.
Two cubes, Grammy.

301
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,127
‐ Oh, darling, you know I don't
drink water with my pills.

302
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,844
I only take sherry.

303
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,854
‐ Oh, okay.

304
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,929
Oh, okay...

305
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,135
‐ You sit down.

306
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,735
‐ Gra‐‐grammy?

307
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,503
‐ Uh, Anna?

308
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,207
Anna?

309
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,644
‐ Are you okay?

310
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,348
‐ Where do you come from, dear?

311
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,480
Because you have
such Mongoloid features.

312
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,820
‐ Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Anna Kone.

313
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,356
I'll be your server.

314
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,859
‐ Honey, no.

315
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,201
You know I don't take water
with my pills.

316
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,866
I take sherry.

317
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,905
‐ She has sherry, Grammy.
‐ Oh, good.

318
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,619
‐ Um, I brought you some
stacked crackers and cheese

319
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,210
because I love you.

320
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,455
‐ Did you wash your hands

321
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,586
before making me
the cheese and crackers?

322
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,586
‐ Um...

323
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,377
‐ Just do it. Just do it.

324
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,094
‐ Sorry, Grammy.
‐ Please‐‐that's right.

325
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,301
‐ Do I need to wash
my hands too?

326
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,639
‐ Yesterday.

327
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,643
Did you wash your hands
really well?

328
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,231
‐ Yes. Wait, Anna, wait.

329
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,686
Do we have to hang out
with her the whole time?

330
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,227
‐ I mean, I know I'm exhausted.

331
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,860
The funny thing is that
she was actually here to help.

332
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,318
‐ I feel like she hates me.

333
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,358
‐ She hates me so much more.

334
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,659
‐ Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

335
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,658
‐ Oh, my God, this is gonna
be my entire childhood.

336
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,873
Okay, we should go.

337
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,884
‐ No, let's play. Please.

338
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,046
Maya, I wish I could.

339
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,506
‐ Grammy.

340
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,216
‐ This sucks.

341
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,903
‐ Are you okay, Grammy?

342
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,938
‐ I wanted
to have my hair done.

343
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,517
‐ Do you like your nails,
Grammy?

344
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,611
Well, you kinda shake a lot.

345
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,912
‐ Okay. Are you ready to look?

346
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,949
‐ Yeah.

347
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,452
‐ Okay, Grammy.

348
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,329
‐ Anna, you're good at this.

349
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,004
Very good.

350
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,343
Oh.
Thank you.

351
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,141
Thank you so much.

352
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,637
‐ Welcome, Grammy.

353
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,982
‐ Pretty.

354
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,823
‐ Sorry today was kinda boring.

355
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,950
Thanks for doing
my Grammy's nails.

356
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,327
It's okay.

357
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,120
‐ Sorry you have ADD.

358
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,286
‐ And Irlen syndrome.

359
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,167
‐ Are you gonna sleep
with your glasses on?

360
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,999
‐ Oh, no.

361
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,424
Can't do that.

362
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,223
Goodnight.
‐ Goodnight.

363
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,418
‐ Anna.

364
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,419
‐ Mom?

365
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,628
Oh, my God.
‐ What? Stop. Stop.

366
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,763
Stop.

367
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,719
Mom?

368
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,799
‐ Wait.

369
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,480
Anna, wait.

370
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,601
‐ Mom?

371
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,740
‐ Mom?

372
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,754
She's gone.

373
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,800
‐ Oh.

374
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,611
‐ Such a psycho.
‐ Side, side, side!

375
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,740
‐ You're about to go
to a funeral.

376
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,777
What's your problem?

377
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,620
You're acting like
Looney Tunes.

378
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,736
Take this pill.

379
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,793
‐ No, I don't wanna
take the pill.

380
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,785
I don't wanna die!
‐ Dame.

381
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,131
‐ There's only so many
heartbeats in a lifetime.

382
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,547
I don't wanna die.

383
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,545
‐ Just take it.

384
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,094
Am I gonna die?

385
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,093
‐ No.

386
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,272
‐ Thank you.

387
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,692
Fine, you keep them.
‐ Oh, thank you.

388
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,730
‐ Thank you.

389
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,944
Thank you for coming.

390
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,953
‐ Thank you for coming.
It means a lot.

391
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,656
‐ I took my medicine,
but I don't feel it yet.

392
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,948
‐ Okay.

393
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,951
‐ Say something nice to Anna.

394
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,413
‐ Yeah.
Sorry about your G‐ma.

395
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,916
Should I go now? Okay.

396
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,472
‐ You better go now.

397
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,297
‐ Right now?
‐ With Anna.

398
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,318
‐ She still has
my nail polish on.

399
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,200
‐ Oh, yeah.

400
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,620
She kinda looks weird.

401
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,825
‐ Yeah.

402
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,788
Do you feel sad?

403
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,249
‐ Right now?
‐ Yeah.

404
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,459
‐ Oh, um...

405
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,628
Sort of.

406
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,420
I will later, I think.
‐ Yeah.

407
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,724
‐ Okay.

408
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,006
Bye, Grammy.

409
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,602
‐ Bye, Grammy.

410
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,018
That was weird.

411
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,016
‐ Yeah.

412
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,607
‐ Um, if everyone wouldn't mind
taking a seat,

413
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,148
I'd like to say a few words
about my mother.

414
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:50,663
Oh, before I forget,
lunch will be served upstairs.

415
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,661
It's nothing elaborate,

416
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,253
but we hope you'll stay
and share your memories.

417
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,880
‐ Oh, my God. Is that Derrick?

418
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,838
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

419
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,758
‐ They're here.
My God, Derrick is so fine.

420
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,222
Okay.

421
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,010
Okay.

422
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,516
All right.

423
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,112
‐ Geraldine Olay Ryan.

424
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,701
‐ Olay is her middle name?

425
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:25,815
I didn't‐‐
‐ Stop.

426
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,451
My mom.

427
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,529
Geraldine Olay Ryan.

428
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,124
She was a character.

429
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,298
She didn't smile a lot.

430
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,495
No, she didn't.

431
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,764
‐ Geraldine Olay Ryan
was a mother

432
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,389
that I loved very much.

433
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,805
‐ Yame nasai.

434
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:56,516
When I found her
facedown,

435
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,188
sprawled out...

436
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,108
It's an image that
I won't get out of my head.

437
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,107
‐ That's quite enough,
young lady.

438
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:10,069
‐ With the oxygen tank
blowing air to no one.

439
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,704
Where was I?

440
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,500
She was the first to graduate
college in her family.

441
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:20,246
And I'm really grateful
that my daughter and I

442
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,630
got to spend her last days...

443
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,511
with her.

444
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,266
‐ I want cheese with that.

445
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,096
Ow!
‐ That was so inappropriate.

446
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,233
‐ Stop. It's not my fault.

447
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,980
That was Anna.
She started it.

448
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,572
‐ Do you need to take
more medicine?

449
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,896
‐ No. I don't even feel it yet.

450
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,156
‐ I don't even feel it.

451
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,289
Oh, wait. Mama?

452
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,501
Mom?

453
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,707
I think I'm feeling it now.

454
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,512
Anna.

455
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,018
Excuse me.

456
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,616
‐ Thank you.

457
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:44,378
‐ Sorry, um, for what I did.

458
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,046
Like, my reaction
wasn't, like, normal.

459
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,550
‐ It's okay.
‐ Really?

460
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,879
‐ Yeah.

461
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,804
I think maybe it is normal.

462
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,388
It's okay.

463
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,288
‐ Pretty freaky, huh?

464
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,076
‐ I'm on methylphenidate
hydrochloride right now.

465
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,585
‐ I tried that once.
It was fun.

466
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,715
I'm Derrick. Wassup?

467
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,101
‐ I'm Maya.

468
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,807
‐ I know.

469
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,492
‐ Thank you.

470
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,161
Who is that?

471
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,619
I don't know.

472
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,665
‐ Hey.

473
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:05,785
Hey, Dad.

474
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,001
‐ How you guys doing?

475
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,752
‐ Great.
‐ Yeah.

476
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,304
Again, Kath, I'm sorry.

477
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,506
She was unique.

478
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,298
‐ I loved her too.

479
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,644
‐ No, you didn't.

480
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,059
‐ Yes, I did.

481
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,977
I mean, I know‐‐I know
she was hard on you

482
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,186
and she messed up a bit,
you know,

483
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,767
here and there.

484
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,938
But I know
how proud of you she is.

485
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,904
‐ Was.
‐ Was.

486
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,406
‐ Yeah, maybe, I don't‐‐

487
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,288
Thank you.

488
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,166
‐ I'm gonna go, okay?
‐ Okay.

489
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,880
‐ That laughing, not funny.

490
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,342
‐ Dad.
‐ I'm serious.

491
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,801
‐ I'm sorry.

492
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,471
‐ You have a little bit
of growing up to do, all right?

493
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:03,219
‐ Okay. Stop. Not now.
It's too much.

494
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,563
‐ Take care of your mom,
all right?

495
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,558
She needs you.

496
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,401
Okay.

497
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,556
Bye. Love you.

498
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,438
‐ Sweet of him to come.

499
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,566
‐ Curtis. Sometimes Curt.

500
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,624
Steven. Sometimes Steve.

501
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,499
‐ Yeah, it is.

502
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,285
‐ Most of the time Steve.

503
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,181
‐ So I brought my fried Maya.

504
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,926
‐ No, I don't wanna
speak right now.

505
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,468
‐ Hi, Maya.
‐ Hi, Maya.

506
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,311
‐ Sorry, she doesn't wanna
speak right now.

507
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,016
So...

508
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,806
um, but for me,
I'll just say that, um,

509
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,811
I'm afraid that...

510
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,324
my Dad is really mad at me
right now.

511
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,737
And that's because I...

512
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,607
told him that I wanted
to live with my mom.

513
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,282
And I told him over the phone.

514
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,664
And I could tell
by just the tone of his voice

515
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:11,543
that he was really, really sad.

516
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,501
I don't want to disappoint him,

517
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,713
but I told him
that my mom needs me right now

518
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,974
'cause my Grammy just passed.

519
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,757
I'm just really worried
about him.

520
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,220
‐ Oh, I'm so sorry
for your loss.

521
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,221
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

522
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,222
Sorry for your loss.

523
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,266
‐ Thanks, Sasha.
I'm good, actually.

524
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,443
I'm not good, but I'm okay.

525
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,571
‐ She's okay, 'cause...

526
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,238
you, like, laughed
during the eulogy,

527
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,357
so it's not, like, that sad.

528
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,324
‐ Well, it's just that a word
struck me funny,

529
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,164
but I'm not‐‐
‐ No, I know.

530
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,789
‐ You laughed, too, so I
don't know why you'd say that.

531
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,446
‐ Yeah, well, it's not
my Grammy, though.

532
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,914
Like...
‐ I'm so sorry.

533
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:53,963
‐ It's okay.

534
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,801
‐ I have ADD
and Irlen syndrome.

535
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,167
‐ Oh.

536
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,053
Well, thank you so much
for sharing, Maya.

537
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,929
‐ You're welcome.

538
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,307
Lost on a island

539
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,437
Catch me drinking
pee‐pee water

540
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,725
Lost in the forest

541
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,648
While I'm drinking
pee‐pee water

542
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,146
Got no fluids

543
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,108
Catch me drinking
pee‐pee water

544
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,438
Drinking pee‐pee water

545
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,943

548
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,038

00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,407
What's up?

551
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,543
What's up?

552
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,669
Hey.

553
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,505

560
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,909

561
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,119
‐ Like, no, on opposite day.

562
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,543
‐ So is that yeah?
‐ Yeah.

563
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,584
You can have tomorrow's

564
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,844

565
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,205

It's all good.

568
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,336
It's still good.
I've taken worse.

569
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,385
‐ So, um,

570
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,889

571
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,017
Your glasses are weird.

572
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,019
‐ Okay.

573
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,479

574
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,315

575
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,242
‐ That's gonna hit nice.

576
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,732
I'm getting dizzy.

577
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,020
Me too.

578
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,704
‐ Mom, did you do my laundry?

579
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,866
No, it's your
responsibility.

580
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,065
‐ Are you kidding?

581
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,001
Ugh.

582
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,416
I already used both sides!

583
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,587
Look on your bed,
sweetie.

584
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,626
‐ My bed?

585
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,338
Grammy's hand‐me‐downs.

586
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,391
She'd want you to have them.
Enjoy.

587
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,885
‐ Ew.

588
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,931

589
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,035
Thanks, Grammy.

590
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,581
Ew.

591
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,172
