WEBVTT

00:08.884 --> 00:11.434
‐ Driver.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.558
Are we almost there?

00:17.768 --> 00:22.358
Goal!

00:34.868 --> 00:37.368
I

00:37.371 --> 00:41.251
I am hiding

00:41.250 --> 00:43.960
The you I show to you

00:43.961 --> 00:47.761
Is just a lie

00:47.756 --> 00:49.506
You take what you want

00:49.508 --> 00:51.178
You get what you take

00:51.176 --> 00:54.846
So high, high, high

00:57.307 --> 00:59.977
‐ Right after that,
I snapped his headphones.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.557
‐ Did your parents react?

01:01.561 --> 01:03.771
‐ They stay out of it.
They don't really give a shit.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.698
‐ Eager Anna.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.867
‐ Thank you.
Um, I just wanted to say

01:13.865 --> 01:15.235
that what you all
are going through

01:15.242 --> 01:16.452
is intense but wonderful.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.451
Kudos.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.082
For me, I have a hamster,

01:19.079 --> 01:20.749
and my Dad got it for me.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.667
Its name is Daddy
'cause I named it that,

01:22.666 --> 01:24.126
and I love it.

01:24.126 --> 01:28.796
Couldn't help but feel like
maybe my Dad is just trying

01:28.797 --> 01:30.837
to sweeten me up
by getting me the pet

01:30.841 --> 01:33.391
because he wants me to live
with him, not with my mom.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.595
‐ Yeah, wow,
y‐you don't have any problems

01:36.597 --> 01:38.887
opening up and sharing, do you?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.980
You remind me of my mailman.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.226
‐ Thank you.

01:42.227 --> 01:45.687
Um, and actually...

01:45.689 --> 01:47.859
just going between
the two places‐‐

01:47.858 --> 01:51.488
my mom's place
and my dad's place‐‐

01:51.486 --> 01:53.276
it's hard,

01:53.280 --> 01:57.530
and my mom is, like,
always late.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.334
Always.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.998
And my Dad is grumpier.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.037
And he didn't get the house,

02:04.041 --> 02:06.211
and I'm just like,
if he doesn't get me, too,

02:06.209 --> 02:08.249
I don't know
what he's gonna do.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.054
‐ You talk like you're 40,
kind of.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.552
‐ Thank you.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.090
And that's actually
a good thing,

02:15.093 --> 02:18.603
because most people don't reach
their full potential

02:18.597 --> 02:21.097
until they're at least 38.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.519
‐ Oh, my goodness, it's time
for us to wrap it up.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.229
Thank you for opening up
and sharing, everyone.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.940
Get all your stuff.
Don't forget your shoes.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.730
Oh, it's just my shoes.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.284
Remember to breathe. Ciao!

02:42.245 --> 02:43.745
‐ Thanks, Tina.
‐ See ya.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.542
‐ What's up?

02:49.544 --> 02:50.754
‐ Hey.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.634
So, uh, you seeing the world

02:52.631 --> 02:54.631
through
rose‐colored lenses now?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.637
No, seriously, I don't get
what the point of it is

02:58.637 --> 03:00.967
'cause, like, they just listen

03:00.972 --> 03:03.732
and they, like, don't
give you advice, you know?

03:03.725 --> 03:06.015
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

03:17.489 --> 03:21.159
Basically, we
diagnose based on a spectrum,

03:21.159 --> 03:25.619
and Maya happens to be
a little bit above average

03:25.622 --> 03:26.792
on that spectrum.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.035
Maya, do you have trouble
focusing?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.964
‐ No, I'm actually
really smart.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.673
‐ Oh, I know you're very smart.
That's not the issue.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.684
Attention Deficit Disorder
is actually quite common,

03:38.677 --> 03:40.597
and many of our patients
have found success

03:40.595 --> 03:42.345
taking methylphenidate
hydrochloride.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.057
‐ Medication for this?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.477
‐ It is a stimulant,

03:45.475 --> 03:47.055
but it actually
has the opposite effect

03:47.060 --> 03:48.480
on kids who have ADD.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.398
It helps them focus.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.897
‐ Maya, then you just better
pay more attention.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.400
‐ I do.
‐ That's all this is.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.492
‐ Stop. Stop.
‐ No.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.658
‐ You know,

03:59.656 --> 04:01.986
Maya is jumping
off the walls like crazy.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.492
And I love that about you,
darling, I do.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.164
But not at school.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.373
‐ And with every medication,
there are some side effects.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.423
Most commonly,
increased heart rate.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.957
But the benefits
do outweigh any discomfort.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.091
‐ No, I don't wanna take
the medicine

04:15.088 --> 04:17.088
if it's gonna
speed up my heart.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.430
‐ Once you acknowledge
the problem,

04:19.426 --> 04:21.886
she can have
extra time on tests

04:21.887 --> 04:24.847
and other assistance that can
help Maya improve her scores.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.518
‐ Extended time on testing?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.226
‐ Yeah,
as much time as you need.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.846
‐ We'll talk about it at home.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.613
‐ I think I wanna take
the medicine.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.685
‐ No.
‐ We'll talk about it.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.569
‐ Mom, I wanna take it!

04:34.566 --> 04:36.106
‐ Oh. Stop. Stop.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.072
‐ Maya...

04:40.071 --> 04:43.331
uh, how do you feel
about fluorescent lights?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.293
‐ I don't feel good
about fluorescent lights.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.963
‐ Anna.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.424
Anna. Anna.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.888
‐ Stop. What are you...

05:03.970 --> 05:06.180
‐ Oh, just stare
at whatever you want.

05:06.181 --> 05:09.641
Like, so stupid.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.393
They're crazy.
‐ I know.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.112
I like that, uh‐‐

05:17.108 --> 05:18.938
I like when your mom's late.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.154
‐ Oh, yeah?
‐ Which is, like, all the time.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.164
I know.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.155
‐ Ope.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.464
‐ Hey.
‐ I know, I'm late.

05:34.918 --> 05:35.958
Yeah.

05:35.961 --> 05:36.961
‐ Who's that guy?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.128
‐ Who are you talking about?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.670
‐ Mr. Loser.
‐ There's no one there.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.884
There's a guy
right there.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.390
Doesn't even know
how to ride his bike.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.386
‐ I don't know who that is.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.507
He's in Teens in Need.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.353
Okay.
Just get in the back.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.938
‐ Irlen syndrome
is a light sensitivity

05:52.936 --> 05:55.396
that can contribute
to reading difficulties,

05:55.397 --> 05:57.477
headaches,
trouble concentrating.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.440
But what can help...

06:02.821 --> 06:05.321
Is wearing
these special glasses.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.872
‐ Do I have to wear these
all day, like, every day?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.463
‐ Well...

06:17.836 --> 06:20.376
Look at Haley Joel Osment
on the red carpet.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.050
He has Irlen syndrome.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.428
He looks great. Very cool.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.914
‐ I love it.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.909
‐ And I know you want me
to do my own laundry.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.409
‐ About that...

06:50.410 --> 06:52.250
‐ But I'm just‐‐it's hard

06:52.245 --> 06:54.365
with all the Teens in Need
and everything.

06:54.372 --> 06:57.462
I can't have dirty underwear.

06:57.459 --> 07:00.049
‐ Thank you.
‐ I got it.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.705
But maybe, just maybe,

07:01.713 --> 07:03.673
I've found someone
to help us with that.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.343
‐ Maybe, just maybe, what?

07:05.342 --> 07:06.552
Found someone to help.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.431
‐ Found someone
to help us with that?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.097
A maid?

07:12.098 --> 07:14.478
Mom. A maid?

07:14.476 --> 07:15.806
Surprise!

07:18.563 --> 07:20.073
‐ Oh, you're late.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.105
Huh.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.398
‐ Grammy.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.451
Oh, my. Oh, my.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.316
Oh, and here I am
as a surprise.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.294
I was going to help out
for the foreseeable future.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.910
‐ How are you?
‐ Hello. Yeah.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.673
You know, I keep telling you
this, and you don't listen.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.076
You're slouching.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.094
And if you continue to slouch,
you're going to get

07:41.086 --> 07:44.586
one of those stomach pooches
just like your mother.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.929
‐ Ha‐ha. Mom, stop.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.175
‐ Oh, well.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.676
I think I'm going to go
and make us some dinner.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.969
Okay. Thanks, Grammy.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.891
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Love you.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.560
‐ Well, yes, thank you.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.518
‐ Bring the groceries.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.031
Near the volcano,

08:10.031 --> 08:13.331
it is distinguished
by a network of cracks.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.502
Where were you?

08:29.634 --> 08:31.474
My Grammy
just moved in with us.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.509
‐ What?
‐ Yeah.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.353
‐ That's crazy.
‐ Yeah.

08:37.016 --> 08:39.516
What? I love these.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.265
‐ I have to wear them
'cause I have ADD

08:43.273 --> 08:44.943
and Irlen syndrome.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.191
And literally, like,
I have to take this medication

08:47.193 --> 08:49.363
that can speed up
your heart rate and kill you.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.242
‐ Wait, what?
‐ Yeah.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.569
‐ Maya.
‐ I know.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.077
‐ I can't lose you.
‐ I know.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.997
‐ Shh. Girls. Movie.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.167
And Maya, no Oakleys
in the classroom.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.497
I actually have Irlen syndrome.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.002
Um...

09:06.004 --> 09:08.384
and I need to wear these
'cause they're prescribed.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.841
So...yeah.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.091
And I'm also supposed
to be on medication right now,

09:12.093 --> 09:13.433
but I'm not on it.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.598
So I'm just having, like,
a really hard day.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.395
‐ Hey, Bowl Cut.
"The Matrix" called.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.685
‐ Neo wants his glasses back.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.149
Haley Joel Osment wears them.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.494
So did you hear
from Steve's friend Derrick?

09:32.489 --> 09:34.239
Did he call you?

09:34.240 --> 09:37.200
‐ You mean the high schooler
that's gonna be my boyfriend?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.582
‐ Yeah.
‐ No, he hasn't.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.038
But I'm just kind of,
like, waiting.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.538
I feel like any day now.
‐ Yeah.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.829
When he does,
we're gonna go on double dates.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.125
‐ Um...

09:47.128 --> 09:48.798
wait, if your Grammy
is living with you,

09:48.797 --> 09:51.467
does that mean I can still
sleep over tonight or no?

09:51.466 --> 09:53.796
‐ Oh, my mom's gonna
take us to Blockbuster.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.522
Shh!

10:01.976 --> 10:03.556
Sorry.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.687
She's such a bitch.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.691
Hi, Mr. Corlado‐‐

10:09.692 --> 10:11.952
Anna, stop.
‐ Stop.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.739
Oh, my God.
Why is my mom honking?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.621
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ What is she doing?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.948
‐ Why is she doing that?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.588
‐ Come on, come on.
Get in, get in.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.417
Oh, hi, honey.
Come on in.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.972
No, not there.
I have my oxygen tank.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.927
‐ Wait, is that your Grammy?

10:37.929 --> 10:39.259
‐ Yeah.
‐ Get in the backseat.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.434
That's good.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.681
‐ I didn't know you were
picking us up.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.233
- Well...
- Hi.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.686
‐ Well, no, Mom is very busy
with her "rackas" clients.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.070
‐ It's reiki, but...

10:49.065 --> 10:51.225
Racka, reiki, ra‐‐

10:51.234 --> 10:55.824
Did you know‐‐did you know
that your mother went through

10:55.822 --> 10:58.912
a whole year of her RN,

10:58.908 --> 11:02.198
and then she met your Dad.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.871
And we all know
how that worked out.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.713
‐ Yeah.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.010
‐ Is she blind?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.965
‐ Um, hi, Grammy. I'm Maya.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.836
‐ It's Mrs. Ryan.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.434
‐ Um, Grammy,
can we go to Blockbuster?

11:19.429 --> 11:20.599
'Cause my mom
was gonna take us.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.522
‐ No.
‐ Sorry, Grammy?

11:24.517 --> 11:25.517
Yeah?

11:25.518 --> 11:26.598
‐ Um, you don't have to honk,

11:26.603 --> 11:27.773
'cause it'll move.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.480
‐ Don't tell me what to do.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.317
If you learned how to type,

11:34.319 --> 11:36.949
it meant you wanted
to be a secretary.

11:36.946 --> 11:41.026
So we took Home Economics
so we could get a good husband.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.206
Mom?

11:52.337 --> 11:54.127
‐ Where are we going?
‐ This way.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.130
‐ Thank you.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.551
‐ Mom?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.719
‐ You don't have to yell
so much.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.758
I mean, you're a tall girl
with a tall voice to match.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.024
Let's go.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.556
‐ Sorry.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.229
‐ You know, I still wanna
have my hair done today.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.649
‐ Where do I put my stuff?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.317
‐ Just wherever.
Maya, you've been here before.

12:12.315 --> 12:15.485
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Maya, don't...yeah.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.945
‐ It's, like, stuck.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.275
‐ Yeah, yeah.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.739
You know, you gotta watch
these things.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.369
They're lethal.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.986
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay. Okay.

12:24.994 --> 12:28.214
It's stuck. Okay.
It's kinda hard to steer.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.416
True.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.035
‐ "Went out with Ramona.
Enjoy your movie."

12:34.337 --> 12:36.007
‐ It's just us tonight.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.971
‐ Well, let's take
a look at this.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.182
Can we go to your room?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.522
‐ Yeah. One sec.
‐ Oh, here it is.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.978
Honey, would you please
call the salon for me?

12:50.979 --> 12:53.269
I want to have
my hair done today‐‐

12:53.273 --> 12:55.783
‐ Okay.
‐ With‐‐with Sheryl.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.815
And do not let them
try to sell you on Theresa

12:59.821 --> 13:02.991
because your mother tells me
she doesn't know one thing.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.996
Yes.
Did Theresa do your hair?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.959
‐ We're sorry,
La Moda Hair Salon

13:12.959 --> 13:14.749
is currently closed.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.052
‐ Uh, Grammy, they're closed.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.916
‐ Well, call again.
Maybe you got the wrong number.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.934
‐ I got the voicemail.
It's definitely them.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.136
They're just closed,
but I can call again tomorrow.

13:24.137 --> 13:28.307
‐ Well, if you hadn't been
lollywagging so much at school,

13:28.308 --> 13:29.978
maybe we could have gotten here

13:29.976 --> 13:32.396
and I could have gotten
my hair done.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.435
You're just like your mother.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.688
‐ Yeah.
‐ Sorry.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.231
‐ Sorry, Grammy.
‐ Sorry, Grammy.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.404
‐ Could you get me something
to drink with my pills dear?

13:41.404 --> 13:42.704
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.157
‐ Okay, Grammy.
‐ Good.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.197
No, no, no. Just you.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.000
Come‐‐you come back, Maya.
Come back.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.865
‐ Maya, she wants you.
‐ You can go alone.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.082
You don't need Maya.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.381
‐ Anna, wait.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.455
‐ Oh, um, help.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.631
‐ Do you need‐‐

13:57.628 --> 13:58.878
‐ She's not gonna be gone
long, darling.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.590
She's not gonna be‐‐
she'll be right back.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.431
‐ Okay.
‐ I know that.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.716
Yes.

14:04.719 --> 14:05.849
‐ Sorry.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.109
You know, I have ADD,
so I have to take pills too.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.238
‐ You have ADD? Hmm.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.083
Well, you know,
everyone only has

14:29.077 --> 14:32.577
a certain amount of beats
in their lifetime.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.080
‐ Really?

14:34.082 --> 14:37.342
‐ That's why
I'm so very quiet and still.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.705
‐ Oh, my God.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.551
‐ I got you water.
Two cubes, Grammy.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.127
‐ Oh, darling, you know I don't
drink water with my pills.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.844
I only take sherry.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.854
‐ Oh, okay.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.929
Oh, okay...

14:53.935 --> 14:55.135
‐ You sit down.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.735
‐ Gra‐‐grammy?

15:12.203 --> 15:14.503
‐ Uh, Anna?

15:14.497 --> 15:16.207
Anna?

15:26.134 --> 15:27.644
‐ Are you okay?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.348
‐ Where do you come from, dear?

15:34.350 --> 15:38.480
Because you have
such Mongoloid features.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.820
‐ Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Anna Kone.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.356
I'll be your server.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.859
‐ Honey, no.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.201
You know I don't take water
with my pills.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.866
I take sherry.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.905
‐ She has sherry, Grammy.
‐ Oh, good.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.619
‐ Um, I brought you some
stacked crackers and cheese

15:54.620 --> 15:56.210
because I love you.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.455
‐ Did you wash your hands

15:57.456 --> 16:01.586
before making me
the cheese and crackers?

16:01.586 --> 16:02.586
‐ Um...

16:02.587 --> 16:04.377
‐ Just do it. Just do it.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.094
‐ Sorry, Grammy.
‐ Please‐‐that's right.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.301
‐ Do I need to wash
my hands too?

16:11.179 --> 16:12.639
‐ Yesterday.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.643
Did you wash your hands
really well?

16:15.641 --> 16:17.231
‐ Yes. Wait, Anna, wait.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.686
Do we have to hang out
with her the whole time?

16:19.687 --> 16:21.227
‐ I mean, I know I'm exhausted.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.860
The funny thing is that
she was actually here to help.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.318
‐ I feel like she hates me.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.358
‐ She hates me so much more.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.659
‐ Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.658
‐ Oh, my God, this is gonna
be my entire childhood.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.873
Okay, we should go.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.884
‐ No, let's play. Please.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.046
Maya, I wish I could.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.506
‐ Grammy.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.216
‐ This sucks.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.903
‐ Are you okay, Grammy?

17:03.898 --> 17:06.938
‐ I wanted
to have my hair done.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.517
‐ Do you like your nails,
Grammy?

17:48.651 --> 17:50.611
Well, you kinda shake a lot.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.912
‐ Okay. Are you ready to look?

17:56.909 --> 17:57.949
‐ Yeah.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.452
‐ Okay, Grammy.

18:01.539 --> 18:05.329
‐ Anna, you're good at this.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.004
Very good.

18:07.003 --> 18:10.343
Oh.
Thank you.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.141
Thank you so much.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.637
‐ Welcome, Grammy.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.982
‐ Pretty.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.823
‐ Sorry today was kinda boring.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.950
Thanks for doing
my Grammy's nails.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.327
It's okay.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.120
‐ Sorry you have ADD.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.286
‐ And Irlen syndrome.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.167
‐ Are you gonna sleep
with your glasses on?

18:48.169 --> 18:49.999
‐ Oh, no.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.424
Can't do that.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.223
Goodnight.
‐ Goodnight.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.418
‐ Anna.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.419
‐ Mom?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.628
Oh, my God.
‐ What? Stop. Stop.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.763
Stop.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.719
Mom?

19:38.719 --> 19:39.799
‐ Wait.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.480
Anna, wait.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.601
‐ Mom?

20:02.410 --> 20:03.740
‐ Mom?

20:08.124 --> 20:09.754
She's gone.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.800
‐ Oh.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.611
‐ Such a psycho.
‐ Side, side, side!

20:36.610 --> 20:37.740
‐ You're about to go
to a funeral.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.777
What's your problem?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.620
You're acting like
Looney Tunes.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.736
Take this pill.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.793
‐ No, I don't wanna
take the pill.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.785
I don't wanna die!
‐ Dame.

20:49.081 --> 20:53.131
‐ There's only so many
heartbeats in a lifetime.

20:53.127 --> 20:54.547
I don't wanna die.

20:54.545 --> 20:55.545
‐ Just take it.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.094
Am I gonna die?

21:01.093 --> 21:02.093
‐ No.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.272
‐ Thank you.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.692
Fine, you keep them.
‐ Oh, thank you.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.730
‐ Thank you.

21:16.734 --> 21:17.944
Thank you for coming.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.953
‐ Thank you for coming.
It means a lot.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.656
‐ I took my medicine,
but I don't feel it yet.

21:24.658 --> 21:25.948
‐ Okay.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.951
‐ Say something nice to Anna.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.413
‐ Yeah.
Sorry about your G‐ma.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.916
Should I go now? Okay.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.472
‐ You better go now.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.297
‐ Right now?
‐ With Anna.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.318
‐ She still has
my nail polish on.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.200
‐ Oh, yeah.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.620
She kinda looks weird.

22:04.615 --> 22:05.825
‐ Yeah.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.788
Do you feel sad?

22:11.789 --> 22:13.249
‐ Right now?
‐ Yeah.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.459
‐ Oh, um...

22:17.378 --> 22:19.628
Sort of.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.420
I will later, I think.
‐ Yeah.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.724
‐ Okay.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.006
Bye, Grammy.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.602
‐ Bye, Grammy.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.018
That was weird.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.016
‐ Yeah.

22:36.647 --> 22:39.607
‐ Um, if everyone wouldn't mind
taking a seat,

22:39.608 --> 22:43.148
I'd like to say a few words
about my mother.

22:44.363 --> 22:50.663
Oh, before I forget,
lunch will be served upstairs.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.661
It's nothing elaborate,

22:52.663 --> 22:56.253
but we hope you'll stay
and share your memories.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.880
‐ Oh, my God. Is that Derrick?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.838
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.758
‐ They're here.
My God, Derrick is so fine.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.222
Okay.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.010
Okay.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.516
All right.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.112
‐ Geraldine Olay Ryan.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.701
‐ Olay is her middle name?

23:24.695 --> 23:25.815
I didn't‐‐
‐ Stop.

23:25.821 --> 23:28.451
My mom.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.529
Geraldine Olay Ryan.

23:33.954 --> 23:37.124
She was a character.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.298
She didn't smile a lot.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.495
No, she didn't.

23:42.504 --> 23:46.764
‐ Geraldine Olay Ryan
was a mother

23:46.759 --> 23:48.389
that I loved very much.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.805
‐ Yame nasai.

23:52.806 --> 23:56.516
When I found her
facedown,

23:56.518 --> 23:59.188
sprawled out...

23:59.188 --> 24:02.108
It's an image that
I won't get out of my head.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.107
‐ That's quite enough,
young lady.

24:04.109 --> 24:10.069
‐ With the oxygen tank
blowing air to no one.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.704
Where was I?

24:11.700 --> 24:15.500
She was the first to graduate
college in her family.

24:15.496 --> 24:20.246
And I'm really grateful
that my daughter and I

24:20.250 --> 24:25.630
got to spend her last days...

24:25.631 --> 24:27.511
with her.

24:34.056 --> 24:36.266
‐ I want cheese with that.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.096
Ow!
‐ That was so inappropriate.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.233
‐ Stop. It's not my fault.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.980
That was Anna.
She started it.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.572
‐ Do you need to take
more medicine?

24:44.566 --> 24:46.896
‐ No. I don't even feel it yet.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.156
‐ I don't even feel it.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.289
Oh, wait. Mama?

24:57.121 --> 24:58.501
Mom?

24:58.497 --> 25:00.707
I think I'm feeling it now.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.512
Anna.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.018
Excuse me.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.616
‐ Thank you.

25:40.998 --> 25:44.378
‐ Sorry, um, for what I did.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.046
Like, my reaction
wasn't, like, normal.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.550
‐ It's okay.
‐ Really?

25:50.549 --> 25:51.879
‐ Yeah.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.804
I think maybe it is normal.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.388
It's okay.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.288
‐ Pretty freaky, huh?

26:20.746 --> 26:24.076
‐ I'm on methylphenidate
hydrochloride right now.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.585
‐ I tried that once.
It was fun.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.715
I'm Derrick. Wassup?

26:35.761 --> 26:37.101
‐ I'm Maya.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.807
‐ I know.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.492
‐ Thank you.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.161
Who is that?

26:59.159 --> 27:00.619
I don't know.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.665
‐ Hey.

27:04.665 --> 27:05.785
Hey, Dad.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.001
‐ How you guys doing?

27:09.002 --> 27:10.752
‐ Great.
‐ Yeah.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.304
Again, Kath, I'm sorry.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.506
She was unique.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.298
‐ I loved her too.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.644
‐ No, you didn't.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.059
‐ Yes, I did.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.977
I mean, I know‐‐I know
she was hard on you

27:23.976 --> 27:27.186
and she messed up a bit,
you know,

27:27.187 --> 27:28.767
here and there.

27:29.898 --> 27:33.938
But I know
how proud of you she is.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.904
‐ Was.
‐ Was.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.406
‐ Yeah, maybe, I don't‐‐

27:45.998 --> 27:47.288
Thank you.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.166
‐ I'm gonna go, okay?
‐ Okay.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.880
‐ That laughing, not funny.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.342
‐ Dad.
‐ I'm serious.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.801
‐ I'm sorry.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.471
‐ You have a little bit
of growing up to do, all right?

27:59.469 --> 28:03.219
‐ Okay. Stop. Not now.
It's too much.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.563
‐ Take care of your mom,
all right?

28:04.558 --> 28:05.558
She needs you.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.401
Okay.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.556
Bye. Love you.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.438
‐ Sweet of him to come.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.566
‐ Curtis. Sometimes Curt.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.624
Steven. Sometimes Steve.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.499
‐ Yeah, it is.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.285
‐ Most of the time Steve.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.181
‐ So I brought my fried Maya.

28:39.176 --> 28:40.926
‐ No, I don't wanna
speak right now.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.468
‐ Hi, Maya.
‐ Hi, Maya.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.311
‐ Sorry, she doesn't wanna
speak right now.

28:44.306 --> 28:46.016
So...

28:46.016 --> 28:49.806
um, but for me,
I'll just say that, um,

28:49.811 --> 28:52.811
I'm afraid that...

28:52.814 --> 28:55.324
my Dad is really mad at me
right now.

28:55.317 --> 28:58.737
And that's because I...

28:58.737 --> 29:00.607
told him that I wanted
to live with my mom.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.282
And I told him over the phone.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.664
And I could tell
by just the tone of his voice

29:07.663 --> 29:11.543
that he was really, really sad.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.501
I don't want to disappoint him,

29:14.503 --> 29:17.713
but I told him
that my mom needs me right now

29:17.714 --> 29:19.974
'cause my Grammy just passed.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.757
I'm just really worried
about him.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.220
‐ Oh, I'm so sorry
for your loss.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.221
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.222
Sorry for your loss.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.266
‐ Thanks, Sasha.
I'm good, actually.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.443
I'm not good, but I'm okay.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.571
‐ She's okay, 'cause...

29:38.568 --> 29:40.238
you, like, laughed
during the eulogy,

29:40.237 --> 29:42.357
so it's not, like, that sad.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.324
‐ Well, it's just that a word
struck me funny,

29:44.324 --> 29:46.164
but I'm not‐‐
‐ No, I know.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.789
‐ You laughed, too, so I
don't know why you'd say that.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.446
‐ Yeah, well, it's not
my Grammy, though.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.914
Like...
‐ I'm so sorry.

29:52.833 --> 29:53.963
‐ It's okay.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.801
‐ I have ADD
and Irlen syndrome.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.167
‐ Oh.

30:00.173 --> 30:03.053
Well, thank you so much
for sharing, Maya.

30:03.719 --> 30:04.929
‐ You're welcome.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.307
Lost on a island

30:09.307 --> 30:11.437
Catch me drinking
pee‐pee water

30:11.435 --> 30:12.725
Lost in the forest

30:12.728 --> 30:14.648
While I'm drinking
pee‐pee water

30:14.646 --> 30:16.146
Got no fluids

30:16.148 --> 30:18.108
Catch me drinking
pee‐pee water

30:18.108 --> 30:19.438
Drinking pee‐pee water

30:19.443 --> 30:20.943
‐ Oh.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.614
Nice, nice.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.488
‐ Stop.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.038
Hey.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.035
- Sup?
- What's up?

30:30.037 --> 30:31.407
What's up?

30:31.413 --> 30:32.543
What's up?

30:32.539 --> 30:33.669
Hey.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.505
‐ Do you wanna be
my girlfriend?

30:42.591 --> 30:43.971
‐ No.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.135
On Opposite Day.

30:48.472 --> 30:49.812
‐ Sick.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.937
‐ Yeah, of course.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.407
Good afternoon.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.696
‐ Good afternoon.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.909
‐ Do you have your meds?

31:08.909 --> 31:11.119
‐ Like, no, on opposite day.

31:12.913 --> 31:14.543
‐ So is that yeah?
‐ Yeah.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.584
You can have tomorrow's
if you want.

31:17.584 --> 31:18.844
‐ Cool.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.205
‐ 'Cause I'm not gonna
take that one. Here.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.672
‐ Yeah. Oh.
‐ Oh, sorry.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.051
It's all good.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.336
It's still good.
I've taken worse.

31:28.595 --> 31:31.385
‐ So, um,

31:31.389 --> 31:32.889
do you wanna be my boyfriend?

31:34.017 --> 31:36.017
Your glasses are weird.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.019
‐ Okay.

31:39.189 --> 31:40.479
‐ Kay.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.315
‐ Oh.
‐ Okay.

31:48.782 --> 31:50.242
‐ That's gonna hit nice.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.732
I'm getting dizzy.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.020
Me too.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.704
‐ Mom, did you do my laundry?

32:27.696 --> 32:29.866
No, it's your
responsibility.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.065
‐ Are you kidding?

32:34.661 --> 32:36.001
Ugh.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.416
I already used both sides!

32:40.417 --> 32:42.587
Look on your bed,
sweetie.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.626
‐ My bed?

32:47.048 --> 32:48.338
Grammy's hand‐me‐downs.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.391
She'd want you to have them.
Enjoy.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.885
‐ Ew.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.931
They're from Grammy!

33:13.825 --> 33:15.035
Thanks, Grammy.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.581
Ew.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.172
Anna?

33:20.165 --> 33:21.415
I'm coming!
