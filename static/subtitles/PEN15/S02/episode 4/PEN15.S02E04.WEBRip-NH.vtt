11:12.933 --> 11:13.933
‐ um, I don't know.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.644
I haven't thought about it.

11:15.644 --> 11:18.234
‐ well, me, Maya, and Anna
have been best friends

11:18.230 --> 11:19.570
since we were, like, two,

11:19.565 --> 11:20.975
and I think it'd be pretty fucked up

11:20.983 --> 11:22.613
to not vote for what's real.

11:23.861 --> 11:24.861
‐ mm‐hmm.

11:24.862 --> 11:26.032
‐ you want a ring pop?

11:26.030 --> 11:27.360

What did you just call me?

12:35.516 --> 12:37.686
Do you even know what that means?

12:37.685 --> 12:40.145
That's the worst thing
you can call a woman.

12:40.145 --> 12:43.065
‐ I thought it was a type of fool.

12:43.065 --> 12:44.935
‐ who's teaching you these words?

12:46.819 --> 12:49.819
‐ I can't remember.

12:49.822 --> 12:51.282
‐ I cunt remember.

12:51.281 --> 12:52.781

13:22.521 --> 13:24.021
<i>what they mean.</i>

13:24.022 --> 13:26.822
<i>Um, I thought maybe it
might be a good time</i>

13:26.817 --> 13:28.317
<i>to do a mother‐daughter shopping day,</i>

13:28.318 --> 13:32.658
<i>and I thought if Maya
came, she'd be more open?</i>

when they're your best friend.

14:39.473 --> 14:41.433
It's, like, yeah, fast.

That's how best friendships happen.

14:42.726 --> 14:43.806

14:56.490 --> 14:57.570
‐ I don't think so.

It's men's t‐shirt.

I'm buying it for you, so no.
‐ okay, but mom, I want it.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.775
I like it. ‐ no.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.275
Maybe you can give it to
Anna because she's taller.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.237
‐ mom, stop. I don't
wanna give it to Anna.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.527
Let me wear it. ‐ I'm not buying it.

For easter.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.039
‐ no, it's just not me.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.004
I don't like it. It's more you.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.384
‐ what's wrong with me?

16:05.381 --> 16:06.881
Nothing.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.342
It's just not me.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.049
It's kinda slutty.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.474
‐ what did you say?

16:13.472 --> 16:14.812
Anna?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.477

- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.824
What did you just call me?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.318
‐ I didn't call you anything.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.199
Can you stop yelling?
My best friend is‐‐

16:29.196 --> 16:30.606
‐ why are you talking to me like that?

16:30.614 --> 16:31.664
Why? ‐ shh!

16:31.657 --> 16:32.737
Lower your voice.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.201
‐ I'm not yelling.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.451
I'm whispering.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.582
Why are you telling me to be quiet?

16:37.579 --> 16:40.249
Why are you shh‐ing me?

16:40.249 --> 16:41.999
Did you learn that from your dad?

16:44.044 --> 16:46.004
‐ I'd rather be like dad than like you.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.255
- Are you ready, na?
- Coming!

16:50.259 --> 16:52.849
I'm trying to look at it.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.599
Ready.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.106
‐ I hate it.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.028
‐ but you look so beautiful, Maya.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.896
You look like your mother.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.613
‐ no, I don't...

17:12.990 --> 17:14.280
...look anything like her.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.163
She's ugly.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.620
Don't say that.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.159
That's really not a nice thing to say.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.874
Your mother is a beautiful woman.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.004
‐ thank you.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.210
‐ and you are very lucky
to look like her.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.710
‐ I don't look like her, and
I don't like this dress.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.014
I never wanted to wear it,
and I want to take it off.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.339
‐ stop, Maya.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.763
You're being rude.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.472
‐ no, I don't like it. You
don't know my taste, mom.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.812
‐ stop. Stop.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.846
Maya, stop. ‐ mom, I
don't wanna buy it!

17:39.850 --> 17:41.480
I wanted to buy the other thing.
Stop it.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.647
Stop acting like a
little spoiled bitch.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.778
‐ thank you for saying that, yuki.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.397
‐ okay. ‐ Anna's doing the same thing.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.914
‐ oh, my god, mom. Mature much?

17:54.907 --> 17:57.277
‐ mom. Are you serious?

17:57.284 --> 17:59.164
You just called your daughter a bitch,

17:59.161 --> 18:01.001
in a store, in front of my friend.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.826
Do you know how embarrassing that is?

18:02.831 --> 18:03.871
‐ I don't care.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.674
You know, you are acting like one.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.287
‐ well, I hate you, you bitch!

18:07.294 --> 18:08.424
‐

18:08.420 --> 18:09.960
‐ I'm sorry.

18:09.963 --> 18:11.723
I didn't mean it. No, stop!

18:11.715 --> 18:13.675
- ‐ I'm gonna stop...
- ‐ mommy, stop it!

18:13.675 --> 18:15.505
‐ Mom, look what you're causing.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.761
‐ oh. Oh, right.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.722
Everything's my fault. ‐
yeah, it's your fault.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.522
‐ okay, you need to stop.
‐ leave me alone!

18:20.516 --> 18:22.016
- Mom!
- Maya.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.597
‐ okay, I'm calling 9‐1‐1 and daddy!

18:24.603 --> 18:26.363
‐ like, this is what you do to daddy.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.815
Blame him for everything and
then you're just like‐‐

18:52.960 --> 18:54.500
I think it looks really good.

18:54.503 --> 18:56.053
I don't know why you
didn't wear it as a dress,

18:56.046 --> 18:58.046
but it still looks good.

18:58.048 --> 18:59.548
‐ thanks for getting it for me.

18:59.550 --> 19:01.010
Of course.

A shopping trip gone bad.

19:32.082 --> 19:35.632

23:47.314 --> 23:48.484
‐ Are you kidding me?

I've ever heard.

23:51.610 --> 23:52.700
‐ no, she doesn't.

23:52.695 --> 23:53.985
I just don't think you hear it

Anna. ‐ but I like it.

23:57.324 --> 23:59.124
‐ you guys, my mom

stuck in my throat

24:49.335 --> 24:52.705
and I was, like, pulling
and pulling and pulling

24:52.713 --> 24:55.803
and it was, like, Maura's
hair stuck in my lungs.

24:55.799 --> 24:57.679
Like, it kept coming out.

24:57.676 --> 24:59.086
‐ ew.

What?

25:23.410 --> 25:24.410
Shut up. ‐

25:24.411 --> 25:25.831
I was gonna say, I love your hat.

25:25.829 --> 25:27.409
We were supposed to be matching
and you're not matching.

25:27.414 --> 25:29.084
Oh, my god. ‐ oh, my god.

25:29.083 --> 25:30.543
You got this? ‐ is this felt?
