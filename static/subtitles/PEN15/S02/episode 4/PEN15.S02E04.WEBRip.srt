‐ Oh.
Oh, right.

528
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,722
Everything's my fault.

‐ Like, this is what you do
to Daddy.

with jeans, but...

546
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,500
ANNA:
I think it looks really good.

547
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,053
I don't know why
you didn't wear it as a dress,

548
00:18:56,046 --> 00:18:58,046
but it still looks good.

549
00:18:58,048 --> 00:18:59,548

550
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,010

Of course.

552
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:04,144
ANNA: No.
My mom's, like, so pissed.

553
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:05,638
All night.
She's so pissed.

Is your mom, like‐‐
did you guys make up?

558
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,939

You saw what my mom did.

559
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:18,071
Like, that was so crazy.

560
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:19,358

00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:25,491
MAYA:
Don't.

Tell her.
ANNA: I'm not.

563
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:28,536
It was...

564
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:32,077
a shopping trip gone bad.

565
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:35,632
‐ So now you didn't invite me
and you don't tell me stuff.

566
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:36,627
Cool.

567

you hear it

‐ You guys, my mom
doesn't have an accent.

692
