2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,426
Maya.

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,444
‐ hmm.

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,730

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,396
‐ okay.

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,874
How is she dealing with her parents?

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,366
‐ okay.

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,746
You normally talk more.

10
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,421
What's wrong?

11
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,262
‐ everyone hates me at school.

12
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,814
I don't wanna talk about it.

13
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:00,847
‐ you care always about what
the others are thinking.

14
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,402
Who cares what the others think?

15
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,437
Neh?

16
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,526

00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,446
‐ so we're just‐‐we're waiting.

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,251
The court has to decide
who's gonna get the house.

19
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,497
Fingers crossed.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,920
Let's hope that, uh, the
judge does the right thing.

21
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,721
Is that too much information?

22
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,637
Oh.

23
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,345
You have a lot of heart
energy in there.

24
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,307
Anna?

25
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,439
You need to open up.

26
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,765
Okay, sorry.

27
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,859
Hey.

We get our nails done,

32
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,196
and we go shopping.

33
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,328

34
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,128

35
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,009
‐ please put the incense out.

36
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,601
It's weird.

Tweedledee and tweedledum.

38
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,610
Wonder what those idiots
are talking about.

39
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,784
‐

40
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,163

00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,861
‐ why would that go to Ian?

77
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,030
‐ I don't know. They

00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,491
So are you, like, resigning

88
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,481
Ugh, I hate this question.

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,290
‐ I wish that they had a
category for best pants.

00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,126
‐ I'm gonna write it in.

'cause he just keeps wanting

170
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:26,965

‐ well, me, Maya, and Anna
have been best friends

00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:20,975
and I think it'd be pretty fucked up

283
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,613

Do you even know what that means?

318
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:40,145
That's the worst thing
you can call a woman.

319
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:43,065
‐ I thought it was a type of fool.

320
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,935

<i>I'm just kinda concerned.</i>

<i>She's been using new words,</i>

<i>and I don't think she really knows</i>

343

<i>what they mean.</i>

344
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:26,822
<i>Um, I thought maybe it
might be a good time</i>

<i>to do a mother‐daughter shopping day,</i>

346
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:32,658
<i>and I thought if Maya
came, she'd be more open?</i>

347

‐ we really don't need anything, but...

348

‐ no.

365
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:13,775

Like... Ew.

‐ it's here if you want it.

So not loaded.

Stupid.

‐ so when are we going
to meet this Maura girl?

376
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:33,383
‐ mom, like, don't ask us that.

377
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:36,513
‐ it seems you three are
really close very fast.

378
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:39,472
‐ yeah, that's what happens
when they're your best friend.

379
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,433
It's, like, yeah, fast.

380
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:42,733
That's how best friendships happen.

‐ it's big, though, no?

390
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,570
‐ I don't think so.

391
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:59,454
I kind of think it's perfect.

392
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:01,581
‐ that's loaded. ‐ that's loaded.

393
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:03,708
‐ ‐ that's not loaded, loaded.

Maya. ‐ mom, stop.

Someone is gonna see my boobs.

Ah, it's‐‐it's okay. ‐ like, knock.

399

‐ I love it.

401
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,008
‐ no, it's not nice. It's a t‐shirt.

402
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,179
It's men's t‐shirt.

403
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,507

I'm buying it for you, so no.
‐ okay, but mom, I want it.

409
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,775
I like it. ‐ no.

410
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,275
Maybe you can give it to
Anna because she's taller.

411
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,237
‐ mom, stop. I don't
wanna give it to Anna.

412
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,527
Let me wear it. ‐ I'm not buying it.

413
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,820

‐ it looks so good on you.
You should get it.

00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,463
For easter.

420
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,039
‐ no, it's just not me.

421
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,004
I don't like it. It's more you.

422
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,384
‐ what's wrong with me?

423
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,881
Nothing.

424
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,342
It's just not me.

425
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,049
It's kinda slutty.

426
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,474
‐ what did you say?

427
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,812
Anna?

428
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,477
‐ nothing. I'm just saying I don't‐‐

429
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,765
Anna.

430
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,348
This is for you.

431
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,153
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

432
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,824
What did you just call me?

433
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,318
‐ I didn't call you anything.

434
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,199
Can you stop yelling?
My best friend is‐‐

435
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,606
‐ why are you talking to me like that?

436
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,664
Why? ‐ shh!

437
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,737
Lower your voice.

438
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,201
‐ I'm not yelling.

439
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,451
I'm whispering.

440
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,582
Why are you telling me to be quiet?

441
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,249
Why are you shh‐ing me?

442
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,999
Did you learn that from your dad?

443
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,004
‐ I'd rather be like dad than like you.

444
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,255
- Are you ready, na?
- Coming!

445
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,849
I'm trying to look at it.

446
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,599
Ready.

447
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,106
‐ I hate it.

448
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,028
‐ but you look so beautiful, Maya.

449
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,896
You look like your mother.

450
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,613
‐ no, I don't...

451
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,280
...look anything like her.

452
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,163
She's ugly.

453
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,620
Don't say that.

454
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,159
That's really not a nice thing to say.

455
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,874
Your mother is a beautiful woman.

456
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,004
‐ thank you.

457
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,210
‐ and you are very lucky
to look like her.

458
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,710
‐ I don't look like her, and
I don't like this dress.

459
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,014
I never wanted to wear it,
and I want to take it off.

460
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,339
‐ stop, Maya.

461
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,763
You're being rude.

462
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,472
‐ no, I don't like it. You
don't know my taste, mom.

463
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,812
‐ stop. Stop.

464
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,846
Maya, stop. ‐ mom, I
don't wanna buy it!

465
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,480
I wanted to buy the other thing.
Stop it.

466
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,647
Stop acting like a
little spoiled bitch.

467
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,778
‐ thank you for saying that, yuki.

468
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,397
‐ okay. ‐ Anna's doing the same thing.

469
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,914
‐ oh, my god, mom. Mature much?

470
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,277
‐ mom. Are you serious?

471
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,164
You just called your daughter a bitch,

472
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,001
in a store, in front of my friend.

473
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,826
Do you know how embarrassing that is?

474
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,871
‐ I don't care.

475
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,674
You know, you are acting like one.

476
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,287
‐ well, I hate you, you bitch!

477
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,424
‐

478
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,960
‐ I'm sorry.

479
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,723
I didn't mean it. No, stop!

480
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,675
- ‐ I'm gonna stop...
- ‐ mommy, stop it!

481
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,505
‐ Mom, look what you're causing.

482
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,761
‐ oh. Oh, right.

483
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,722
Everything's my fault. ‐
yeah, it's your fault.

484
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,522
‐ okay, you need to stop.
‐ leave me alone!

485
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,016
- Mom!
- Maya.

486
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,597
‐ okay, I'm calling 9‐1‐1 and daddy!

487
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,363
‐ like, this is what you do to daddy.

488
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,815
Blame him for everything and
then you're just like‐‐

489
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,226
you're such a...

490
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,364
‐ what?

491
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,400
‐ you're‐‐ Kathy: Just say it.

492
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,902
‐ a cunt.

493
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:35,729
Stop, stop, stop!

494
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:37,284
Stop!

495
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,070
‐ mom, you're embarrassing me!

496
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:42,282
You're embarrassing me!
‐ you too, okay?

497
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:44,492
‐

498
00:18:49,414 --> 00:18:51,214
‐ I mean, I think it looks stupid

499
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,958
with jeans, but...

500
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,500
I think it looks really good.

501
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,053
I don't know why you
didn't wear it as a dress,

502
00:18:56,046 --> 00:18:58,046
but it still looks good.

503
00:18:58,048 --> 00:18:59,548
‐ thanks for getting it for me.

504
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,010
Of course.

505
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,089
‐ are you okay?

506
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:04,144
No. My mom's, like, so pissed.

507
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:05,638
All night. She's so pissed.

508
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:07,719
Maura.

509
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:10,194
It's great. Thank you.

510
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:11,515
What about you?

511
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,190
Is your mom, like‐‐
did you guys make up?

512
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,939
‐ I mean, no. You saw what my mom did.

513
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:18,071
Like, that was so crazy.

514
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:19,358
‐ what did she do?

515
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:25,491
Don't.

516
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:27,292
Tell her. I'm not.

517
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:28,536
It was...

518
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:32,077
A shopping trip gone bad.

519
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:35,632
‐ so now you didn't invite me
and you don't tell me stuff.

520
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:36,627
Cool.

521
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:42,862
‐ I‐‐sorry. I'm sorry.

522
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,452
That's not what I meant.

Maura.

524
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:46,698
‐ Maura, are you serious?

525
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:47,989
Are you joking? ‐ Maura, come on!

565
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:08,157

‐ my good stuff's somewhere

567
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:12,204

Stop. ‐ what else do you have in here?

580
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:35,596

‐ dude, you have, like,
nothing here, Maya.

‐

588
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:48,951
This isn't funny, you guys. Stop.

589

This is actually, like,
not fun right now.

590

‐ chillax, Maya. God.

591
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:54,832
- ‐ Maya, chill.

00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:56,747
‐ I'm not being sensitive.

593
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:58,036
I just want an arm.

594
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,039
You guys are being really annoying.

595
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,042
Whatever.

596
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:03,593
‐ okay, have fun with arms.

597
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:05,876
What is this? Like, a fishing net?

What?

599
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:26,028

00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:36,662
‐ is it Maura?

604
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,330
‐ no.

605
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,960
I love her.

606
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:46,625
Stop!

607
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,381
Stop looking at me!

‐ are they being nice to you?
‐ mom, yes!

609

They're being nice to me!
They're my best friends!

610
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:58,926
You don't know anything!

611
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:02,603
Why are you freaking like this?

612
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:03,903
‐ Maya?

613
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:05,056
‐

614
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:06,444
‐ nothing is working in here.

615
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,570
‐ it's faulty!

616
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,528
‐ ‐ you okay?

617
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,239
‐ can you not use my gum, please?

618

‐ okay! ‐ sorry.

619
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,405
I'm trying to save
that for my birthday.

620
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,158
‐ why? It's just gum.

621
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,870
‐ mom, go. Please.

622
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:21,871
Go!

623
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:24,995
‐ mom, stop. Can you go?

624
00:23:26,252 --> 00:23:28,302
‐ mom, please, go. It's fine.

625
00:23:28,295 --> 00:23:29,705
‐ then tell her to clean it up.

626
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:31,053
- Okay.
- I don't like it.

627
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:34,178
‐ okay, okay, okay! Go.

628
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:36,176
Mom, it's fine. Leave.

629
00:23:36,178 --> 00:23:38,098
We'll clean it up. Sorry.

630
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:39,387
Oh, my gosh.

631
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,180
‐ Maya, your mom has, like...

632
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:45,404
A scary accent.

633
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:47,306
‐ my mom doesn't have an accent.

634
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:48,484
‐ Are you kidding me?

635
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:50,232
She has, like, the thickest accent

636
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:51,614
I've ever heard.

637
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,700
‐ no, she doesn't.

638
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:53,985
I just don't think you hear it

639
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:54,988
because she's your mom.

640
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:57,319
Anna. ‐ but I like it.

641
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:59,124
‐ you guys, my mom
doesn't have an accent.

642
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:00,868
That's, like, a really
mean thing of you to say.

643
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,620
Like, you guys are being really rude.

644
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:04,791
‐ dude, I'm not trying to be rude.
I'm just saying, she has an‐‐

645
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,630
‐ well, can you please,
like, clean up the clothes?

646
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,085
'Cause you're making a really big mess.

647
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:09,955
‐ okay, but, I mean,
you were doing it too.

648
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:11,132
‐ not as much as you, Maura. Like‐‐

649
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,420
guys, don't‐‐ ‐ yeah, you were.

650
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:14,223
‐ don't fight! Please, please.

651
00:24:14,216 --> 00:24:17,086
Just remember, like, we
are three best friends.

652
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:18,974
‐ you're so right, Anna. I'm sorry.

653
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:21,561
Remember that.

654
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:23,267
‐ you guys are my number ones.

655
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:29,229
- Maya.
- Maya.

656
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,280
‐ love you fools. ‐ love you fools.

657
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:36,572
‐ love you.

658
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:44,952
‐ I had a really weird dream
last night about Maura.

659
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:46,623
I was like‐‐

660
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:49,344
it felt like I had something
stuck in my throat

661
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:52,705
and I was, like, pulling
and pulling and pulling

662
00:24:52,713 --> 00:24:55,803
and it was, like, Maura's
hair stuck in my lungs.

663
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,679
Like, it kept coming out.

664
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:59,086
‐ ew.

665
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:00,554
You have an amazing brain.

666
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:01,974
Hi!

667
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:03,522
Hi!

668
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:05,935
Hi, fools. How you doing?

669
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:07,435
‐ good.

670
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:08,976
Best best friends!

671
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:10,519
‐ whoo! ‐ yes!

672
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:11,862
‐ yes. ‐ yes!

673
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:13,607
‐ I'm really excited.
‐ I'm really excited.

674
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:14,779
- I'm really proud.
- ‐

675
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:16,447
so excited.

676
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:18,855
So, my mom went ahead and
got us a little something.

677
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,454
What?

678
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,410
Shut up. ‐

679
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:25,831
I was gonna say, I love your hat.

680
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:27,409
We were supposed to be matching
and you're not matching.

681
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:29,084
Oh, my god. ‐ oh, my god.

682
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,543
You got this? ‐ is this felt?

683
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:32,462
- No, it's angora.
- Oh, no, I know.

684
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:33,671
I love angora.

685
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:35,261
‐ they look so good on you guys.

686
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:36,336
Do you like it, Maya?

687
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,010
‐ yeah, it just doesn't fit.

688
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:41,509
Can you‐‐

689
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:43,142
it looks really good like that.

690
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:45,678
Oh, okay. ‐ let's just‐‐yeah.

691
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:46,983
‐ thank you. ‐ how?

692
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,266
‐ we need to look good.

693
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,649
We're gonna be looking
at this when we're 40.

694
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:53,727
All right, best best friends?

695
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:55,532
That's us. ‐ get ready.

696
00:25:55,526 --> 00:25:56,986
‐ oh, wait. Hang on.

697
00:25:56,986 --> 00:25:58,526
There's something else.

698
00:26:02,283 --> 00:26:03,783
‐ what? ‐ Maura!

699
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:05,084
You're so nice.

700
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:06,747
‐ no, no, open it.

701
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,455
Open it. ‐ oh.

702
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:09,615
‐

703
00:26:09,623 --> 00:26:10,963
They're friendship necklaces.

704
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,378
Oh, my god.

705
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:14,456
‐ it's three and it makes a heart.

706
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:15,751
I have the middle piece.

707
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:18,916
‐ oh, my god. ‐

708
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,764
I know! ‐ incredible.

709
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,889
It says "best friends forever."

710
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:24,386
‐ yeah. Put it on.

711
00:26:24,388 --> 00:26:27,978
It'll look really good for the picture.

712
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:35,482
- I like them together.
- Yeah, I like it.

713
00:26:35,483 --> 00:26:37,743
‐ actually, that might be kinda weird.

714
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:40,155
With two.

715
00:26:40,155 --> 00:26:41,615
‐ oh, right. Sorry.

716
00:26:41,615 --> 00:26:43,195
- Yeah, stupid.
- Yeah.

- Just the one.
- Oh, yeah.

718
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:45,951
Okay, jk.

719
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,503
Just put it safely there.

720
00:26:49,748 --> 00:26:51,078
‐ kay.

721
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,133
Let's go.

722
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:58,628
Oh, uh, Maya, I might
