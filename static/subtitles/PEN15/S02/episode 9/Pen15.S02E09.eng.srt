1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,588
Last time on Pen15...

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,168
I just think the real thing
is that we've changed.

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,934
Yeah. So weird.

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,682
It's like, I think
we're on another level.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,480
But you look
so beautiful, Maya.

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,095
You look like your mother.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,521
I don't look
anything like her.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,810
She's ugly.

9
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,022
‐ Maya, stop acting like
a little spoiled bitch.

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,404
‐ I don't like you.
You're ugly.

11
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,242
Maya.

12
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,028
You're gonna be okay.

13
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,276
My parents,
they're divorcing,

14
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,374
but they kind of share
the house.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,080
‐ Sounds worse than
the "every other weekend" deal.

16
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,626
Did your mom tell you?

17
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,876
She's getting the house?

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,298
You'll have to decide
who you want to live with.

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,803
‐ Wait.
‐ That's the lead.

20
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:51,931
‐ Oh, my God!

21
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,387
‐ That is incredible.
‐ Wait.

22
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,927
Gonna be in the spotlight

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,970
‐ I know that you cast
your play already,

24
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,394
but if you have
an understudy role, I'm free.

25
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,733
We're techies‐‐we handle

26
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,187
all the technical elements
of the play.

27
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,647
‐ Kone, I'm making you
stage manager.

28
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,569
‐ Maya, you gotta remember
your lines.

29
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,488
‐ All you have to do right now
is just, like, pep me up.

30
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,656
‐ Good luck.
‐ Okay, you just jinxed me.

31
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,195
- It's "Break a leg."
- Ready, star?

32
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,122
Sam, how much do you like Maya

33
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,872
on a scale of one to ten?

34
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,133
Maya Ishii‐Peters?

35
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,335
You were just really good
in the play.

36
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,705
I've never seen you
like that before.

37
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,513
‐ When we sorta kissed
in my room,

38
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,717
you said
that you had butterflies.

39
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,968
I‐I didn't.

40
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,260
It's not you. It‐‐

41
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,309
‐ Maya!

42
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,157
‐ Vince Carter put
his whole arm in the rim.

43
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,239
‐ I know, he was, like,
hanging there from his elbow.

44
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,664
I know.

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,330
‐ Sam.

46
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,673
‐ Anna, stop.

47
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,048
‐ Hey.

48
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,085
‐ Hey.

49
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,931
Turn around. Like...

50
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,085
‐ She said my name.

51
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,803
‐ I know. I didn't.

52
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,973
‐ Turn around.

53
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,102
So, like, do you think

54
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,518
that the dress is
too short, or‐‐

55
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,636
‐ No, I love it.
‐ Are you sure?

56
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,813
‐ Yeah.
‐ Alex doesn't like it.

57
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,310
‐ What?
I love it.

58
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,022
I think you should wear it.
‐ All right.

59
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,572
Look at his shoes.

60
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,315
I think I saw them at Payless.

61
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,437
- Sad.
- I know.

62
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,534
Those are disgusting.

63
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,659
Oh, my God.

64
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,558
‐ Does anyone know
what these lines stand for?

65
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,597
Hmm?

66
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:09,111
These six lines...stand
for the six million people

67
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,476
killed in the Holocaust.

68
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,863
Jewish people, gypsies,

69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,070
handicapped people,
homosexuals,

70
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,871
but mostly Jews were rounded up

71
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:23,535
by the Nazis, put in camps,
and eventually killed.

72
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,247
Six million lives.

73
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,038
Can you even comprehend that?

74
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,132
These camps...

75
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,877
‐ Oh, my God,
I feel, like, so bad

76
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,918
for the Jewish people
in World War II.

77
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,722
‐ I do too.
Prisoners were
systematically murdered...

78
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,965
‐ I could cry, honestly.

79
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,007
Over time
by their ruthless Nazi captors.

80
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,761
‐ Me too.
Mr. O: When a Nazi
would show up

81
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,143
at a Jewish person's door,

82
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,980
they were given one hour

83
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,096
to pack a bag

84
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,523
before being loaded
into a train

85
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,072
and taken away forever.

86
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,436
Yes, Miss Roth?

87
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,533
‐ I'm Jewish,

88
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,567
and it's really messed up,
you guys.

89
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,911
‐ I'm half.
‐ Oh, yeah.

90
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,616
‐ My grandfather once married
a Jewish woman,

91
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,157
but they got divorced
after a year.

92
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,372
‐ Ah. Okay.

93
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,292
It's actually such crazy timing

94
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,961
that we're talking about
the Holocaust right now,

95
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,339
because my bat mitzvah's
next weekend.

96
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,916
Everyone in this class
is invited, obviously,

97
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,182
but you guys, I haven't
received all the RSVPs.

98
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,925
So please, please, please RSVP.

99
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,676
All right, guys, guys...yeah.

100
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,969
I heard
there's gonna be Dippin' Dots.

101
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,104
At the party.
‐ Shh.

102
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,190
And you have an assignment.

103
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,185
‐ Shh.
‐ Guys.

104
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,186
‐ You guys, I'm sorry.

105
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,767
I'm not trying to be bossy.

106
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,482
There's just‐‐he's talking.
Mr. O: Thank you.

107
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,942
‐ There's an assignment, so...
Mr. O: Thank you.

108
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,191
‐ I'm trying to write it down.

109
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,243
Thank you.

110
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,359
Your homework assignment is
to present to the class

111
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,994
what single item
that you would bring with you

112
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,413
if the Nazis showed up
at your door.

113
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,291
‐ Oh, my God.

114
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:56,174
I, I am hiding

115
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,011
That you I show to you

116
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,797
Is just a lie

117
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,433
You take what you want

118
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,929
You get what you take

119
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,731
They jumped
so high, high, high

120
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,596
‐ You know, if we were
in the States in this time,

121
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,984
we'd be in the internment camp.

122
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,270
‐ Blah, blah, blah, blah, Mama.

123
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,654
I just, like‐‐I don't know
what I'm gonna wear.

124
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,952
I feel like, if I'm gonna go,
I should wear

125
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,906
the spaghetti strap dress,
maybe?

126
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,366
Or, like, get‐‐
‐ Focus on your homework.

127
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,656
‐ I am, Mom!
‐ Please.

128
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,449
‐ I'm just, like‐‐
I don't know what to bring.

129
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,536
I got something
of your grandma's.

130
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,792
I'll go get it for you.

131
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,383
You can bring them
to school, huh?

132
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,959
Okay?

133
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,974
‐ Okay, I don't care.

134
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,943
Shuji, have you ever been
to a bat mitzvah before?

135
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,898
I'm invited to one.

136
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,898
‐ Yeah, I've been to a couple.

137
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,940
They're bomb.

138
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,323
‐ Yeah, I know.

139
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,280
I think there's gonna be,
like, Dippin' Dots there

140
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,661
or something.

141
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,487
But, like, if I were gonna have
a bat mitzvah,

142
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,292
I feel like, I don't know,

143
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,496
I'd have Mom and Dad get me,
like...

144
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,457
a water fountain of Kool‐Aid
or something.

145
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,248
‐ Mom and Dad could never
afford that.

146
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,382
‐ What are you talking about?
Yeah, they could.

147
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,509
‐ Mom and Dad don't even own
this house.

148
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,337
‐ Okay, so what,
we live here for free?

149
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,472
No, seriously, like...

150
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,810
we're, like,
upper‐middle class,

151
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,805
like Anna, right?

152
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,016
‐ We're not even middle.

153
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,977
We're probably low.

154
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,857
Lower‐middle, if anything.

155
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,355
‐ But, like,
we can afford things.

156
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,146
Like, I have clothes and stuff.

157
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,280
We're not poor.

158
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,736
‐ We're dirt‐poor.
‐ No, we're not.

159
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,237
Dad has money. Like‐‐
‐ Dad's basically homeless.

160
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,619
‐ Stop it!
‐ Yeah.

161
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,366
‐ Stop!
‐ We're extra‐poor!

162
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,367
‐ Stop! Stop it, Shuji.

163
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,039
Say we're not poor.

164
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,288
Stop.

165
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,669
Maya, Maya,
we found some of Ojichan's

166
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,207
and Obachan's things.

167
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,841
You can take them all to school
and share and...

168
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,300
this was Obachan's.

169
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,140
Oh, I remember this.

170
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,545
And, oh, look at this.

171
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,184
Oh, some family photo too. Wow.

172
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,448
‐ Have you heard from your dad?

173
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,990
Anna!
‐ Yes.

174
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,453
‐ Is he still in that
crappy motel, or has he...

175
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,714
‐ He's still looking
for an apartment.

176
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,876
‐ Look, I'm really sorry
I have to go through you,

177
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,955
you know, but it's just‐‐
he just won't answer my‐‐

178
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,710
‐ He just doesn't want to talk
to you right now,

179
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,132
and you know that,
and so, like...

180
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,511
‐ Why are you so moody?

181
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,678
‐ Because I'm learning
about the Holocaust, okay?

182
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,048
‐ Okay.
‐ Like...

183
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,184
Okay, I'm sorry.

184
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,270
‐ Mom, I'm talking to you.
‐ Okay.

185
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,475
‐ Why are you leaving?

186
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,475
‐ I get‐‐I don't know.

187
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,726
‐ Are we Jewish?

188
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,517
Like, I know
that we're Unitarian and stuff,

189
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,652
and Russian, German, Polish...

190
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,861
but are we Jewish?

191
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,491
‐ German.

192
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,778
A lot of German.

193
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,037
‐ Are there Nazis
in our family?

194
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,157
‐ No.

195
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,963
Grampy fought them
in World War II.

196
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,377
I have his war mementos.

197
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,285
‐ Mom.
‐ Yes?

198
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,424
‐ Have I discovered
a family secret?

199
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,262
‐ There are no Nazis
in our family.

200
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,601
‐ Do you think that Nazis...

201
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,178
are all in Hell?

202
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,773
I don't know if Hell exists.

203
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,782
But if it does,
they are definitely there.

204
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,565
But then if it doesn't exist,

205
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,319
you're saying it's just fine
they're in heaven?

206
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,240
‐ I'm‐‐I'm saying I don't
even know if heaven exists.

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,200
‐ So then if there's no heaven,
where do you go when you die?

208
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,082
‐ I don't know.

209
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,499
I think you just have to be
in the present moment.

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
Why would He let
all this happen?

211
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,338
Why would He let
all this happen?

212
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,877
‐ Grampy?
‐ No.

213
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,721
God.

214
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,006
‐ Well, maybe God is a she,
or...

215
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,061
or a nothing, I don't know.

216
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,346
I don't know why evil exists
in this world.

217
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,270
Anna, I don't know.

218
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,939
I don't know
why there's suffering.

219
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,107
I don't know.

220
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,071
‐ It doesn't make sense.

221
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,528
No, it doesn't.

222
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,947
‐ And you don't have
any answers at all.

223
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,236
I'm sorry.

224
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,296
That's so cute.
I love that.

225
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,261
- It's so pretty.
- Right?

226
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,061
‐ Wait, you've already
gotten presents

227
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,135
and your bat mitzvah
hasn't even happened?
‐ Yeah.

228
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,640
‐ You guys, they're just
from family who live far away.

229
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,313
This one's good,
but my cousin got me a necklace

230
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,862
from Claire's.

231
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,765
Like, I get a rash from nickel.

232
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,654
Like, that's why
I only wear Swarovski.

233
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,781
Yeah. Yeah, like,
I know that about you.

234
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,487
‐ Sorry.

235
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,754
‐ All right, gang,
time for presentations.

236
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,666
Who wants to go first?

237
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,499
Ishii‐Peters,
love the enthusiasm.

238
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:30,634
‐ Okay.

239
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,465
Whoo!

240
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,849
‐ Um...

241
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,311
okay, so if the Nazis showed up
at my house

242
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,862
and was like,
"You have one hour to pack,

243
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,977
and you can only bring
one thing,"

244
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,324
um, I would bring...

245
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,950
this Chanel shopping bag.

246
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,658
Thank you.

247
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,238
That's what you're
bringing to the Holocaust?

248
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,624
That's crazy.

249
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,790
‐ You might die or never see
your family again,

250
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,829
and you'd bring
a Chanel shopping bag?

251
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,753
‐ Well, I wasn't‐‐

252
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,013
well...I also, um...
I brought‐‐

253
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,467
‐ You can only bring one thing.

254
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,136
Thank you, Maya.

255
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,426
So good.

256
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,768
‐ I get it.
You could put stuff in the bag.

257
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,885
- Shut up.
- Okay.

258
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,523
Becca, why don't‐‐why don't you
come up?

259
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,559
Becca, we love you.

260
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,949
‐ I would bring this picture
of my great‐great grandparents

261
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,405
who I admire so much.

262
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,565
Thanks.

263
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,622
Great, great.

264
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,618
Um...

265
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,460
Miss Kone.

266
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,929
‐ I'd bring a bullet.

267
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,387
‐ To kill Hitler.

268
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,887
So that none of this
ever happened.

269
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,179
‐ All right, I don't think
you should have that at school.

270
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,352
I should probably
confiscate that.

271
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,350
Yeah, um, I have a question.

272
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,272
How are you gonna shoot
without a gun?

273
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,400
‐ I'd find one at the place.
‐ That's stupid.

274
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,778
A knife would kill
way more Nazis than one bullet.

275
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,106
‐ No, if you had
a ton of bullets,

276
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,240
the bullets would do more.

277
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,277
Are you kidding?

278
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,279
‐ But, Anna, killing is wrong.

279
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,871
Think about it.
‐ Is it?

280
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,076
Is it in this situation,
though?

281
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,537
Because think about it.
Sometimes you have

282
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,076
to take justice
into your own hands

283
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,500
'cause God lets
things like this happen.

284
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,289
- If He or She even exists.
- Okay.

285
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,959
You can't say that!

286
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,634
Guys.
You can't
bring a bullet.

287
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,552
‐ You guys.

288
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,590
You guys.

289
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,684
I feel like it's because
we survived the Holocaust

290
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,970
that so many of us
have faith today.

291
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,694
Like, it's this feeling
I get when I'm in temple

292
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,845
that despite all the odds
being stacked against me

293
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,823
and my ancestors, we survived.

294
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,775
And that's how I know
God exists.

295
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,855
There's signs around me
every day.

296
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,610
It's kind of beautiful.

297
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,823
On a more serious note,

298
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,584
if you guys park
in front of the temple

299
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,695
on my bat mitzvah,
my dad will have to tow you.

300
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,663
So, like, do not do that, okay?

301
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,012
‐ Mom, how 'bout this one?
Like...

302
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,876
‐ Maya, no. No.
‐ No, no, just to look through.

303
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,974
That's the one she wants.

304
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,760
‐ That's not appropriate
for her.

305
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,814
I don't even have
a jewelry like that.

306
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,558
‐ Mom, it's a necklace.
Like, she'll want that.

307
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,191
‐ Oh, how 'bout this one?

308
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,767
Mm, it's nice.

309
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,442
‐ Mom, what is wrong with you?
I'm not giving her a pen.

310
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,822
‐ Pen is a nice gift.
‐ Mom, oh, my God.

311
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,320
Ugh, you're, like,
so old‐fashioned.

312
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,582
Like, you don't understand.
You can't give a pen!

313
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,695
You have to give, like...
like, a necklace,

314
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,952
like something like this.

315
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,413
Like, that's something
she would really like,

316
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,003
and I feel like I need
to get that.

317
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,211
‐ You know, you can always‐‐
‐ Mom, seriously, please?

318
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,209
Like, can I just
get her this necklace?

319
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,301
‐ Maya, we can always get her
18 dollar.

320
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,178
It's Jewish good luck.

321
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,810
‐ Wow.

322
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,386
Okay, yeah,
I'm gonna write a check‐‐

323
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,731
or no, I'll just put a bunch
of single dollar bills

324
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,097
in a little envelope,

325
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,813
be like,
"Hey, happy bat mitzvah.

326
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,693
Here's $18 that you can spend
on a can of Coke!"

327
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,531
Are you serious?

328
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,026
You're acting like we're poor!

329
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,698
Like, what is wrong with you?

330
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,946
Literally,
you're ruining my life!

331
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,618
Like, I need it!

332
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,117
Guys, guys, come on.

333
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,578
Enough with the yelling,
all right? Come on.

334
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,909
Uh, Yuki, let's‐‐
let's just get it.

335
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,634
‐ No‐‐I mean, a necklace
from Swarovski?

336
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,415
Yes.
Well, if it's important to her,

337
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,628
you know, I can play a couple
of more gigs this week.

338
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,879
- I mean, look at her.
- Absolutely not.

339
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,171
No.

340
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,224
- Come on, honey.
- Absolutely not.

341
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,638
It's too expensive.

342
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,968
Welcome to Swarovski.

343
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,972
This is Karen speaking.
How can I help you?

344
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,144
‐ This necklace, Dad.
‐ Yeah, hello, Karen.

345
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,062
‐ Dad, this one.
‐ Um, I was wondering, uh,

346
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,772
how much it would be total

347
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,944
for the Stone Necklace.

348
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,953
‐ That one's 135.

349
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,565
Wowza.

350
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,281
Listen, uh, Karen, we're, uh‐‐

351
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,082
we're trying to get
a bat mitzvah gift.

352
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,246
‐ Dad.
‐ Is there something a little‐‐

353
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,535
‐ Hi, Karen.
‐ Hi.

354
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,868
‐ Hi. Sorry.
‐ That's okay.

355
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,462
‐ Um, okay.

356
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,037
How 'bout...

357
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,052
how 'bout the Sparkling Dance
Heart Necklace?

358
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,295
How much is that?

359
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,126
‐ That's $120.

360
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,722
Mom, it's only $120. Mom.

361
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,967
Or how about
the Flower Bracelet,

362
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,259
'cause that one
doesn't have a chain,

363
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,432
so maybe it's less expensive?

364
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,390
Or...

365
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,641
we don't have to.

366
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,142
We don't have to.
I don't want it. It's okay.

367
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,524
No, no, no, no, no.
‐ No. No. No.

368
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,810
We're on the phone.

369
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,153
‐ Hello?
‐ No, Mom doesn't want...

370
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,398
Uh, Karen, yeah.

371
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,899
- Can you just hold on a sec?
- Sure.

372
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,440
‐ Listen, the, um‐‐
the big diamond

373
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,534
that's‐‐that's a little showy.

374
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,819
‐ No, I know.
We don't have to.

375
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,242
‐ Maybe the Sparkling Dance
Heart Necklace

376
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,952
is‐is more appropriate for 13.

377
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,952
It's classy.

378
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,543
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

379
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,368
Yeah. Hey, um, yeah, Karen.

380
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,833
‐ Mom, we don't have to.
‐ Listen, is there any way

381
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,293
- you could do layaway?
- Sure.

382
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,793
- That won't be a problem.
- All right, good.

383
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,674
And‐‐ooh, look.

384
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,761
Two‐for‐one pizza.

385
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,875
Antonio's. Boi‐oi‐oi‐oing!

386
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:07,883
Yeah, okay.

387
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:08,894
All right, are you ready?

388
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,647
‐ Late much?

389
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,478
Oh, my God, that's my gift.

390
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,483
‐ Sorry.

391
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,154
‐ Literally so expensive.

392
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,453
‐ You guys.
‐ Sorry.

393
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,066
‐ Sorry, he just stepped
on my gift.

394
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,331
‐ Maya?
‐ What?

395
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,633
‐ You know how Becca was like,
"Oh, there's, like, a sign

396
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,208
so I know that God exists"?

397
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,303
‐ Yeah.
‐ Like, I want that.

398
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,298
‐ Okay.

399
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,469
‐ But I'm not seeing it yet,

400
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,927
so will you pray with me
so God hears?

401
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,468
‐ Okay.

402
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,475
God, if you exist,

403
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,693
make the rabbi's handkerchief
fall when I open my eyes.

404
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,634
Amen

405
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,758
I'm blue

406
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,589
Da ba dee da ba di

407
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,274
Da ba dee da ba di
da ba dee da ba di

408
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:41,095
Da ba dee da ba di
da ba dee da ba di

409
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,732
Da ba dee da ba di
da ba dee da ba di

410
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,020
Oh, my God, this party's,
like, unbelievable.

411
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,453
Oh, my God!
They have Dippin' Dots.

412
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,695
Oh, my God.

413
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,487
‐ Okay, okay.

414
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,370
I'm definitely gonna get
strawberry nanners.

415
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,987
I'm getting it.

416
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,286
Glow sticks!

417
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,749
It's earth's poison.

418
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,918
But I guess it doesn't matter.

419
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,248
I don't care.

420
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,463
‐ When should I give my present
to her?

421
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,383
Should I give it now or later?

422
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,182
‐ What?
‐ Okay, later.

423
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,635
I'm gonna give it later
because I feel like

424
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,305
she's not gonna
even pay attention to it now.

425
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,610
Whatever Lola wants

426
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,857
Lola gets

427
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,110
And little man

428
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:38,532
Little Lola wants you

429
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:43,214
Make up your mind to have

430
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,125
‐ She's so good.
‐  No regrets

431
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,705
‐ That's why
it's musical‐theatre themed.

432
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,711
Resign yourself

433
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,093
You're through

434
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,295
I always get

435
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:02,891
What I aim for

436
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,192
And your heart and soul

437
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:11,857
Is what I came for

438
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,696
Thank you guys so much
for coming to my bat mitzvah.

439
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,699
As a woman,
I feel it's my responsibility

440
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,621
to make sure you all have
a great time tonight.

441
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,000
So let's make this party
super cool!

442
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,878
Yeah!

443
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,345
We are family

444
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:44,266
I got all my sisters
with me

445
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:48,396
We are family

446
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,726
Get up everybody and sing

447
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,032
We are family

448
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,277
‐ What?

449
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,908
You're not having fun?

450
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:03,117
‐ No, I'm just not in the mood
right now.

451
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,709
Yeah.

452
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,325
You sufferin'?

453
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,253
‐ Kinda, yeah.

454
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,263
But I don't know.
It doesn't matter, actually.

455
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,585
‐ Oh, see...

456
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,881
I don't‐‐I don't agree
with that.

457
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,104
There is nothing
that doesn't matter.

458
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,347
You know...

459
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,310
Becca's grandma always used
to say,

460
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,611
"If you're lucky enough
to live...

461
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,276
"live.

462
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,895
"And if you get the chance
to dance...

463
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,532
Dance."

464
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,033
It's electric!

465
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,799
You can't see it

466
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,179
It's electric!

467
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,097
You gotta feel it

468
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,305
It's electric!

469
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,516
Ooh, it's shakin'

470
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,186
It's electric!

471
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:37,552
Here, there, everywhere

472
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,006
I've got to move

473
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,297
Whoo!

474
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,600
I'm going on a party ride

475
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,215
I've got to groove,
groove, groove

476
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,483
And from this music,
I just can't hide

477
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,148
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

478
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,865
Sorry.

479
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,748
Went in the wrong door.

480
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,754
‐ Kone?

481
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,879
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ It's me.

482
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,745
- Steve.
- So embarrassing. Yeah.

483
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,382
I see that.

484
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,379
‐ Hey.

485
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,170
‐ Hey.

486
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,144
Sorry, I can't breathe.

487
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,517
‐ It's cool. It's fine. It's...

488
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,805
come on.

489
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:32,979
Follow me.

490
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,227
‐ Okay.

491
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,199
‐ You know, Becca, you're,
like, so good at singing.

492
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,737
‐ Thank you.
‐ Yeah, that's what
I was gonna say.

493
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,490
You're, like, really good.
‐ Oh, you guys are so sweet.

494
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,702
‐ Do you take, like, lessons
or...

495
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,792
‐ I take a few,

496
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,366
but I definitely just
love performing.

497
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,751
‐ Yeah.
‐ You're a natural.

498
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,377
‐ So good.
‐ Thanks.

499
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,585
‐ Hi, Becca.

500
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,785
Congratulations.

501
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,504
It's so amazing.

502
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,964
It's, like, awesome.

503
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,474
‐ Thank you.

504
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,636
‐ Um, I just‐‐I have my gift
for you,

505
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,345
so I wanted you to open it.
‐ Oh, thanks.

506
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,965
You could just put it
on the table behind me.

507
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,272
‐ Or actually, can you‐‐

508
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,885
it's just, like,
a really special gift,

509
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,692
so if you don't mind,
just, like, open it.

510
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,555
‐ Sure.

511
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,609
You've been on my mind

512
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,624
And I think it is the time

513
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,947
To let you know

514
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,162
‐ Do you wanna dance, Maya?

515
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,456
What?

516
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,551
‐ Do you wanna dance?

517
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,545
‐ No, I heard you.

518
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,006
I'm just like, "What?"

519
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,059
No, 'cause you don't have
good shoes.

520
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,885
‐ What?
‐ I'm just kidding.

521
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,390
I'm just kidding. Sorry.
Can you‐‐

522
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,101
I'm, like, in the middle
of something,

523
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,651
so it's a little annoying.

524
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,895
Oh, cute.

525
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,436
I think I have
a couple of these,

526
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,439
but thanks, Maya.

527
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,780
So sweet.

528
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,025
Is there, like, a receipt?

529
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,896
- 'Cause you can return it.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

530
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,913
Thanks, Maya.
‐ You're welcome.

531
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,105
Do you like it?

532
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,744
Yeah, it's‐‐
it's really pretty.

533
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,241
Thanks.

534
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,292
Anyway, so we should have,
like, a slumber party.

535
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,116
- Totally.
- Bring snacks.

536
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,251
‐ Yeah!

537
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,458
‐ One, two, three, four,

538
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,382
five, six, seven, hold.

539
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,842
One, two, three, four,

540
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,762
five, six, seven, exhale.

541
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,722
Working?

542
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,687
Sorry.

543
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,807
‐ You feeling better?

544
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,074
‐ Yeah.

545
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,685
I don't know what's happening.

546
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,108
‐ Crème de menthe?

547
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,953
‐ Okay.

548
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,988
I don't...yeah.

549
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,083
Thanks.

550
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,253
Anna, where have you been?

551
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,840
‐ Hi, Mai.
‐ What the hell? Like‐‐

552
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,165
‐ Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

553
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,209
I just had, like,
a total freak‐out,

554
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,923
and I just bumped into Steve.

555
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,263
‐ Hi.
‐ He's just making me
feel better.

556
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,468
‐ Hey.

557
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,177
‐ Sorry, like...

558
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,097
‐ You okay?

559
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,256
‐ Yeah, no, I'm fine.

560
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,524
It's just, like,
Becca opened the gift

561
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,845
and didn't like it, so...

562
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,350
‐ Sorry.

563
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,152
‐ Want a drink?
‐ Oh, yeah.

564
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,194
Did you drink?

565
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,190
‐ Just a little,

566
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,191
but I won't have more

567
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,192
unless you want some.

568
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,613
‐ No, I‐‐let's drink, damn it.

569
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,531
‐ Yeah, and I love
this alcohol, actually.

570
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,990
‐ Yeah, it's‐‐it's good

571
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,280
because it doesn't make
your breath smell like alcohol,

572
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,494
just minty fresh.

573
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,504
‐ It burns.

574
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,865
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

575
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,712
‐ Are you gonna get in trouble
for being out here?

576
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,246
Fuck 'em.

577
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,672
Fuck 'em.

578
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,723
‐ Yeah.

579
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,755
What do you guys think
happens when you die?

580
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,640
‐ You rot.

581
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,847
God doesn't exist.

582
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,189
‐ Agreed.

583
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,688
‐ Yeah.

584
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,200
‐ Can I have your number?

585
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,239
‐ What?

586
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,791
‐ Uh, can I have your number?

587
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,866
‐ Yeah, sure.

588
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,247
‐ I don't usually go
for younger girls,

589
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,250
but you're‐‐you're different.

590
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,392
‐ Thanks.

591
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,388
I should steal it back.

592
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,559
Guys?

593
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,887
Sorry, guys?

594
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,391
Sorry, I think I should steal
the present back.

595
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,864
'Cause my parents spent
a lot of money on it.

596
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:28,895
Right?

597
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,017
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

598
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,733
‐ 'Cause she doesn't even
know it's there.

599
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,783
Like, she won't miss it.

600
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,106
‐ Yeah, 'cause she's a bitch.

601
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,701
‐ She sounds like a bitch.
‐ She was a bitch.

602
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:36,946
‐ Take it back.
‐ Let's...

603
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,317
‐ Okay!
‐ Fucking get your gift back.

604
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,453
‐ Let's do it.
‐ Okay, so I'm doing it?

605
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,779
‐ We're doing it.
‐ Okay, I'm doing it.

606
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,794
Okay, fine. Oh, my God.

607
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,156
Okay.

608
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,787
‐ It's okay, be chill.

609
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,456
‐ Are they looking?

610
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,629
‐ Where? No.

611
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,837
I see her. She's right there.
Go. Go.

612
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,435
‐ This is my necklace,
and I'm taking it.

613
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,689
Just taking it back. I got it.

614
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,357
Oh, my God, is she looking?
‐ No, she's not looking.

615
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,199
You are crazy

616
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,779
You are a crazy girl

617
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,001
I see the questions

618
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:29,536
In your eyes

619
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:35,171
I know what's weighing
on your mind

620
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,592
You can be sure

621
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,931
I know my part

622
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,678
‐ You okay?
‐ Yeah.

623
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,679
‐ Anna, may I have this dance?

624
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,643
‐ Um, can Maya dance with us?

625
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,524
‐ No, I don't want
to be a third wheel.

626
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,060
‐ It's okay.
‐ No, I don't wanna.

627
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,274
It's cool.

628
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,903
It's all one wheel.

629
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,361
‐ Yeah.

630
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,451
It's one wheel.

631
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,407
‐ Stop.
‐ I'm so drunk.

632
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,527
I'm so drunk.

633
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,374
And I swear

634
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:12,831
By the moon and the stars
in the sky

635
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,424
I'll be there

636
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,631
I swear

637
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,091
I'm a horse.

638
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,551
Like a shadow

639
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,470
That's by your side

640
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,391
I'll be there

641
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,140
Wait, are you into Steve?

642
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,853
Like, are you guys going out?

643
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,153
‐ Shh.
‐ He can't hear.

644
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,150
He just asked for my number.

645
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,151
‐ Oh, my God, okay.

646
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,624
You have a boyfriend now!

647
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,825
‐ Maya?
‐ What?

648
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,275
You should meet
my friend Derrick.

649
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,254
I think he'd really like you.

650
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,785
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Stop!

651
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,169
‐ Future boyfriend.

652
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,995
‐ Shut up, Anna! No, I don't‐‐

653
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,791
‐ He's cool, he's cool.

654
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,634
‐ He's cool.

655
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,420
‐ Wait, we're like...

656
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,594
you guys.
‐ Like, yeah.

657
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,681
Oh, my God, stop.

658
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,348
We'll hang some memories

659
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:11,227
On the walls

660
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,112
‐ That's not what I wanted.

661
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,579
‐ Hey, party girl.

662
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,788
No hello?

663
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,417
‐ Hey, Mam‐‐Mom.

664
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,585
How was it?

665
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,836
Was it fun?

666
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,178
So fun.

667
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,427
‐ Can I give you a hug?

668
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,600
‐ Mm‐hmm.

669
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,439
Mm.

670
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,646
‐ Mm.

671
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,860
‐ Have you been drinking?

672
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,450
‐ No!

673
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,235
What?

674
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,869
Sorry.

675
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,827
‐ What's going on with you?

676
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,131
‐ Is it Maya?

677
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,590
No, it's not Maya.

678
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,262
It's you and Dad.

679
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,721
It's you and Dad.

680
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,722
And nothing matters.

681
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,023
‐ I'm so sorry.

682
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,859
You can always talk to me or...

683
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,822
Spirit or...

684
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,873
whatever,
if you feel overwhelmed.

685
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,747
‐ Mm‐hmm.

686
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,955
Thanks.

687
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:01,795
Mm...
‐ But you don't need to drink.

688
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,795
‐ Everything is spinning.

689
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,224
Ugh.

690
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:11,928
Will you lay down with me, Mom?

691
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,107
Hold my hand.

692
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,491
‐ You haven't wanted me
to hold your hand

693
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,568
since you were eight.

694
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,008
Thank you.

695
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,415
I love you.

696
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,974
‐ I love you too.

697
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,358
‐ Mom.
‐ Hm?

698
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,532
What is this?

699
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,030
It's a necklace.

700
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,413
Mm.

701
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,449
‐ I'm sorry I made Dad
buy it for me.

702
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,134
You can keep it, okay?
