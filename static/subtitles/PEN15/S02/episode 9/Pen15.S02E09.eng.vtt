WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:04.588
Last time on Pen15...

00:04.588 --> 00:07.168
I just think the real thing
is that we've changed.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.934
Yeah. So weird.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.682
It's like, I think
we're on another level.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.480
But you look
so beautiful, Maya.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.095
You look like your mother.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.521
I don't look
anything like her.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.810
She's ugly.

00:20.812 --> 00:24.022
‐ Maya, stop acting like
a little spoiled bitch.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.404
‐ I don't like you.
You're ugly.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.242
Maya.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.028
You're gonna be okay.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.276
My parents,
they're divorcing,

00:34.284 --> 00:36.374
but they kind of share
the house.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.080
‐ Sounds worse than
the "every other weekend" deal.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.626
Did your mom tell you?

00:42.626 --> 00:44.876
She's getting the house?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.298
You'll have to decide
who you want to live with.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.803
‐ Wait.
‐ That's the lead.

00:50.801 --> 00:51.931
‐ Oh, my God!

00:51.927 --> 00:53.387
‐ That is incredible.
‐ Wait.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.927
Gonna be in the spotlight

00:54.930 --> 00:56.970
‐ I know that you cast
your play already,

00:56.974 --> 00:59.394
but if you have
an understudy role, I'm free.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.733
We're techies‐‐we handle

01:00.727 --> 01:02.187
all the technical elements
of the play.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.647
‐ Kone, I'm making you
stage manager.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.569
‐ Maya, you gotta remember
your lines.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.488
‐ All you have to do right now
is just, like, pep me up.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.656
‐ Good luck.
‐ Okay, you just jinxed me.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.195
- It's "Break a leg."
- Ready, star?

01:17.452 --> 01:20.122
Sam, how much do you like Maya

01:20.122 --> 01:21.872
on a scale of one to ten?

01:21.873 --> 01:23.133
Maya Ishii‐Peters?

01:23.125 --> 01:25.335
You were just really good
in the play.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.705
I've never seen you
like that before.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.513
‐ When we sorta kissed
in my room,

01:30.507 --> 01:32.717
you said
that you had butterflies.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.968
I‐I didn't.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.260
It's not you. It‐‐

01:37.889 --> 01:39.309
‐ Maya!

01:55.407 --> 01:57.157
‐ Vince Carter put
his whole arm in the rim.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.239
‐ I know, he was, like,
hanging there from his elbow.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.664
I know.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.330
‐ Sam.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.673
‐ Anna, stop.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.048
‐ Hey.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.085
‐ Hey.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.931
Turn around. Like...

02:13.925 --> 02:15.085
‐ She said my name.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.803
‐ I know. I didn't.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.973
‐ Turn around.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.102
So, like, do you think

02:20.098 --> 02:21.518
that the dress is
too short, or‐‐

02:21.516 --> 02:22.636
‐ No, I love it.
‐ Are you sure?

02:22.643 --> 02:23.813
‐ Yeah.
‐ Alex doesn't like it.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.310
‐ What?
I love it.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.022
I think you should wear it.
‐ All right.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.572
Look at his shoes.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.315
I think I saw them at Payless.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.437
- Sad.
- I know.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.534
Those are disgusting.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.659
Oh, my God.

02:58.428 --> 03:02.558
‐ Does anyone know
what these lines stand for?

03:02.557 --> 03:04.597
Hmm?

03:04.601 --> 03:09.111
These six lines...stand
for the six million people

03:09.106 --> 03:11.476
killed in the Holocaust.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.863
Jewish people, gypsies,

03:13.860 --> 03:16.070
handicapped people,
homosexuals,

03:16.071 --> 03:18.871
but mostly Jews were rounded up

03:18.865 --> 03:23.535
by the Nazis, put in camps,
and eventually killed.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.247
Six million lives.

03:26.248 --> 03:29.038
Can you even comprehend that?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.132
These camps...

03:30.127 --> 03:31.877
‐ Oh, my God,
I feel, like, so bad

03:31.878 --> 03:33.918
for the Jewish people
in World War II.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.722
‐ I do too.
Prisoners were
systematically murdered...

03:35.715 --> 03:36.965
‐ I could cry, honestly.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.007
Over time
by their ruthless Nazi captors.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.761
‐ Me too.
Mr. O: When a Nazi
would show up

03:41.763 --> 03:43.143
at a Jewish person's door,

03:43.140 --> 03:45.980
they were given one hour

03:45.976 --> 03:48.096
to pack a bag

03:48.103 --> 03:50.523
before being loaded
into a train

03:50.522 --> 03:53.072
and taken away forever.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.436
Yes, Miss Roth?

03:54.443 --> 03:55.533
‐ I'm Jewish,

03:55.527 --> 03:57.567
and it's really messed up,
you guys.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.911
‐ I'm half.
‐ Oh, yeah.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.616
‐ My grandfather once married
a Jewish woman,

04:02.617 --> 04:05.157
but they got divorced
after a year.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.372
‐ Ah. Okay.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.292
It's actually such crazy timing

04:09.291 --> 04:10.961
that we're talking about
the Holocaust right now,

04:10.959 --> 04:13.339
because my bat mitzvah's
next weekend.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.916
Everyone in this class
is invited, obviously,

04:15.922 --> 04:18.182
but you guys, I haven't
received all the RSVPs.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.925
So please, please, please RSVP.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.676
All right, guys, guys...yeah.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.969
I heard
there's gonna be Dippin' Dots.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.104
At the party.
‐ Shh.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.190
And you have an assignment.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.185
‐ Shh.
‐ Guys.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.186
‐ You guys, I'm sorry.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.767
I'm not trying to be bossy.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.482
There's just‐‐he's talking.
Mr. O: Thank you.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.942
‐ There's an assignment, so...
Mr. O: Thank you.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.191
‐ I'm trying to write it down.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.243
Thank you.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.359
Your homework assignment is
to present to the class

04:41.364 --> 04:44.994
what single item
that you would bring with you

04:44.993 --> 04:46.413
if the Nazis showed up
at your door.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.291
‐ Oh, my God.

04:51.374 --> 04:56.174
I, I am hiding

04:56.171 --> 04:59.011
That you I show to you

04:59.007 --> 05:02.797
Is just a lie

05:02.803 --> 05:04.433
You take what you want

05:04.429 --> 05:05.929
You get what you take

05:05.931 --> 05:09.731
They jumped
so high, high, high

05:09.726 --> 05:12.596
‐ You know, if we were
in the States in this time,

05:12.604 --> 05:13.984
we'd be in the internment camp.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.270
‐ Blah, blah, blah, blah, Mama.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.654
I just, like‐‐I don't know
what I'm gonna wear.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.952
I feel like, if I'm gonna go,
I should wear

05:20.946 --> 05:22.906
the spaghetti strap dress,
maybe?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.366
Or, like, get‐‐
‐ Focus on your homework.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.656
‐ I am, Mom!
‐ Please.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.449
‐ I'm just, like‐‐
I don't know what to bring.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.536
I got something
of your grandma's.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.792
I'll go get it for you.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.383
You can bring them
to school, huh?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.959
Okay?

05:38.964 --> 05:41.974
‐ Okay, I don't care.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.943
Shuji, have you ever been
to a bat mitzvah before?

05:54.938 --> 05:56.898
I'm invited to one.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.898
‐ Yeah, I've been to a couple.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.940
They're bomb.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.323
‐ Yeah, I know.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.280
I think there's gonna be,
like, Dippin' Dots there

06:04.281 --> 06:05.661
or something.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.487
But, like, if I were gonna have
a bat mitzvah,

06:07.492 --> 06:09.292
I feel like, I don't know,

06:09.286 --> 06:12.496
I'd have Mom and Dad get me,
like...

06:12.497 --> 06:15.457
a water fountain of Kool‐Aid
or something.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.248
‐ Mom and Dad could never
afford that.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.382
‐ What are you talking about?
Yeah, they could.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.509
‐ Mom and Dad don't even own
this house.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.337
‐ Okay, so what,
we live here for free?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.472
No, seriously, like...

06:27.470 --> 06:28.810
we're, like,
upper‐middle class,

06:28.805 --> 06:29.805
like Anna, right?

06:29.806 --> 06:32.016
‐ We're not even middle.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.977
We're probably low.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.857
Lower‐middle, if anything.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.355
‐ But, like,
we can afford things.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.146
Like, I have clothes and stuff.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.280
We're not poor.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.736
‐ We're dirt‐poor.
‐ No, we're not.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.237
Dad has money. Like‐‐
‐ Dad's basically homeless.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.619
‐ Stop it!
‐ Yeah.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.366
‐ Stop!
‐ We're extra‐poor!

06:49.367 --> 06:51.367
‐ Stop! Stop it, Shuji.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.039
Say we're not poor.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.288
Stop.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.669
Maya, Maya,
we found some of Ojichan's

06:57.667 --> 07:00.207
and Obachan's things.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.841
You can take them all to school
and share and...

07:03.840 --> 07:05.300
this was Obachan's.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.140
Oh, I remember this.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.545
And, oh, look at this.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.184
Oh, some family photo too. Wow.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.448
‐ Have you heard from your dad?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.990
Anna!
‐ Yes.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.453
‐ Is he still in that
crappy motel, or has he...

07:34.454 --> 07:36.714
‐ He's still looking
for an apartment.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.876
‐ Look, I'm really sorry
I have to go through you,

07:38.875 --> 07:40.955
you know, but it's just‐‐
he just won't answer my‐‐

07:40.960 --> 07:42.710
‐ He just doesn't want to talk
to you right now,

07:42.712 --> 07:45.132
and you know that,
and so, like...

07:45.131 --> 07:46.511
‐ Why are you so moody?

07:46.508 --> 07:49.678
‐ Because I'm learning
about the Holocaust, okay?

07:49.678 --> 07:51.048
‐ Okay.
‐ Like...

07:51.054 --> 07:52.184
Okay, I'm sorry.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.270
‐ Mom, I'm talking to you.
‐ Okay.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.475
‐ Why are you leaving?

07:55.475 --> 07:56.475
‐ I get‐‐I don't know.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.726
‐ Are we Jewish?

07:57.727 --> 08:00.517
Like, I know
that we're Unitarian and stuff,

08:00.522 --> 08:04.652
and Russian, German, Polish...

08:04.651 --> 08:06.861
but are we Jewish?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.491
‐ German.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.778
A lot of German.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.037
‐ Are there Nazis
in our family?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.157
‐ No.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.963
Grampy fought them
in World War II.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.377
I have his war mementos.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.285
‐ Mom.
‐ Yes?

08:23.294 --> 08:25.424
‐ Have I discovered
a family secret?

08:25.422 --> 08:28.262
‐ There are no Nazis
in our family.

08:31.511 --> 08:35.601
‐ Do you think that Nazis...

08:35.598 --> 08:37.178
are all in Hell?

08:40.353 --> 08:42.773
I don't know if Hell exists.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.782
But if it does,
they are definitely there.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.565
But then if it doesn't exist,

08:47.569 --> 08:49.319
you're saying it's just fine
they're in heaven?

08:49.320 --> 08:52.240
‐ I'm‐‐I'm saying I don't
even know if heaven exists.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.200
‐ So then if there's no heaven,
where do you go when you die?

08:56.202 --> 08:58.082
‐ I don't know.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.499
I think you just have to be
in the present moment.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.920
Why would He let
all this happen?

09:03.918 --> 09:06.338
Why would He let
all this happen?

09:06.337 --> 09:07.877
‐ Grampy?
‐ No.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.721
God.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.006
‐ Well, maybe God is a she,
or...

09:13.011 --> 09:16.061
or a nothing, I don't know.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.346
I don't know why evil exists
in this world.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.270
Anna, I don't know.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.939
I don't know
why there's suffering.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.107
I don't know.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.071
‐ It doesn't make sense.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.528
No, it doesn't.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.947
‐ And you don't have
any answers at all.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.236
I'm sorry.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.296
That's so cute.
I love that.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.261
- It's so pretty.
- Right?

09:55.261 --> 09:57.061
‐ Wait, you've already
gotten presents

09:57.055 --> 09:59.135
and your bat mitzvah
hasn't even happened?
‐ Yeah.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.640
‐ You guys, they're just
from family who live far away.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.313
This one's good,
but my cousin got me a necklace

10:04.312 --> 10:05.862
from Claire's.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.765
Like, I get a rash from nickel.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.654
Like, that's why
I only wear Swarovski.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.781
Yeah. Yeah, like,
I know that about you.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.487
‐ Sorry.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.754
‐ All right, gang,
time for presentations.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.666
Who wants to go first?

10:26.459 --> 10:29.499
Ishii‐Peters,
love the enthusiasm.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.634
‐ Okay.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.465
Whoo!

10:40.849 --> 10:42.849
‐ Um...

10:42.851 --> 10:46.311
okay, so if the Nazis showed up
at my house

10:46.312 --> 10:48.862
and was like,
"You have one hour to pack,

10:48.857 --> 10:50.977
and you can only bring
one thing,"

10:50.984 --> 10:54.324
um, I would bring...

10:54.320 --> 10:56.950
this Chanel shopping bag.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.658
Thank you.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.238
That's what you're
bringing to the Holocaust?

11:01.244 --> 11:02.624
That's crazy.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.790
‐ You might die or never see
your family again,

11:04.789 --> 11:06.829
and you'd bring
a Chanel shopping bag?

11:06.833 --> 11:10.753
‐ Well, I wasn't‐‐

11:10.753 --> 11:14.013
well...I also, um...
I brought‐‐

11:14.007 --> 11:15.467
‐ You can only bring one thing.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.136
Thank you, Maya.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.426
So good.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.768
‐ I get it.
You could put stuff in the bag.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.885
- Shut up.
- Okay.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.523
Becca, why don't‐‐why don't you
come up?

11:26.519 --> 11:29.559
Becca, we love you.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.949
‐ I would bring this picture
of my great‐great grandparents

11:35.945 --> 11:37.405
who I admire so much.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.565
Thanks.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.622
Great, great.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.618
Um...

11:43.620 --> 11:45.460
Miss Kone.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.929
‐ I'd bring a bullet.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.387
‐ To kill Hitler.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.887
So that none of this
ever happened.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.179
‐ All right, I don't think
you should have that at school.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.352
I should probably
confiscate that.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.350
Yeah, um, I have a question.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.272
How are you gonna shoot
without a gun?

12:09.270 --> 12:12.400
‐ I'd find one at the place.
‐ That's stupid.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.778
A knife would kill
way more Nazis than one bullet.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.106
‐ No, if you had
a ton of bullets,

12:16.110 --> 12:17.240
the bullets would do more.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.277
Are you kidding?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.279
‐ But, Anna, killing is wrong.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.871
Think about it.
‐ Is it?

12:21.866 --> 12:24.076
Is it in this situation,
though?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.537
Because think about it.
Sometimes you have

12:25.536 --> 12:27.076
to take justice
into your own hands

12:27.080 --> 12:29.500
'cause God lets
things like this happen.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.289
- If He or She even exists.
- Okay.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.959
You can't say that!

12:35.964 --> 12:37.634
Guys.
You can't
bring a bullet.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.552
‐ You guys.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.590
You guys.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.684
I feel like it's because
we survived the Holocaust

12:43.680 --> 12:45.970
that so many of us
have faith today.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.694
Like, it's this feeling
I get when I'm in temple

12:48.685 --> 12:50.845
that despite all the odds
being stacked against me

12:50.853 --> 12:53.823
and my ancestors, we survived.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.775
And that's how I know
God exists.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.855
There's signs around me
every day.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.610
It's kind of beautiful.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.823
On a more serious note,

13:02.824 --> 13:04.584
if you guys park
in front of the temple

13:04.575 --> 13:06.695
on my bat mitzvah,
my dad will have to tow you.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.663
So, like, do not do that, okay?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.012
‐ Mom, how 'bout this one?
Like...

13:18.006 --> 13:21.876
‐ Maya, no. No.
‐ No, no, just to look through.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.974
That's the one she wants.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.760
‐ That's not appropriate
for her.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.814
I don't even have
a jewelry like that.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.558
‐ Mom, it's a necklace.
Like, she'll want that.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.191
‐ Oh, how 'bout this one?

13:33.187 --> 13:34.767
Mm, it's nice.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.442
‐ Mom, what is wrong with you?
I'm not giving her a pen.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.822
‐ Pen is a nice gift.
‐ Mom, oh, my God.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.320
Ugh, you're, like,
so old‐fashioned.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.582
Like, you don't understand.
You can't give a pen!

13:45.575 --> 13:47.695
You have to give, like...
like, a necklace,

13:47.702 --> 13:48.952
like something like this.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.413
Like, that's something
she would really like,

13:50.413 --> 13:52.003
and I feel like I need
to get that.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.211
‐ You know, you can always‐‐
‐ Mom, seriously, please?

13:55.209 --> 13:57.209
Like, can I just
get her this necklace?

13:57.211 --> 14:00.301
‐ Maya, we can always get her
18 dollar.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.178
It's Jewish good luck.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.810
‐ Wow.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.386
Okay, yeah,
I'm gonna write a check‐‐

14:10.391 --> 14:12.731
or no, I'll just put a bunch
of single dollar bills

14:12.727 --> 14:14.097
in a little envelope,

14:14.103 --> 14:15.813
be like,
"Hey, happy bat mitzvah.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.693
Here's $18 that you can spend
on a can of Coke!"

14:18.691 --> 14:20.531
Are you serious?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.026
You're acting like we're poor!

14:22.028 --> 14:23.698
Like, what is wrong with you?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.946
Literally,
you're ruining my life!

14:25.948 --> 14:27.618
Like, I need it!

14:27.617 --> 14:29.117
Guys, guys, come on.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.578
Enough with the yelling,
all right? Come on.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.909
Uh, Yuki, let's‐‐
let's just get it.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.634
‐ No‐‐I mean, a necklace
from Swarovski?

14:35.625 --> 14:37.415
Yes.
Well, if it's important to her,

14:37.418 --> 14:39.628
you know, I can play a couple
of more gigs this week.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.879
- I mean, look at her.
- Absolutely not.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.171
No.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.224
- Come on, honey.
- Absolutely not.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.638
It's too expensive.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.968
Welcome to Swarovski.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.972
This is Karen speaking.
How can I help you?

14:51.974 --> 14:53.144
‐ This necklace, Dad.
‐ Yeah, hello, Karen.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.062
‐ Dad, this one.
‐ Um, I was wondering, uh,

14:56.062 --> 14:59.772
how much it would be total

14:59.774 --> 15:01.944
for the Stone Necklace.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.953
‐ That one's 135.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.565
Wowza.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.281
Listen, uh, Karen, we're, uh‐‐

15:08.282 --> 15:10.082
we're trying to get
a bat mitzvah gift.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.246
‐ Dad.
‐ Is there something a little‐‐

15:12.245 --> 15:13.535
‐ Hi, Karen.
‐ Hi.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.868
‐ Hi. Sorry.
‐ That's okay.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.462
‐ Um, okay.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.037
How 'bout...

15:18.042 --> 15:21.052
how 'bout the Sparkling Dance
Heart Necklace?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.295
How much is that?

15:22.296 --> 15:24.126
‐ That's $120.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.722
Mom, it's only $120. Mom.

15:26.717 --> 15:27.967
Or how about
the Flower Bracelet,

15:27.969 --> 15:29.259
'cause that one
doesn't have a chain,

15:29.262 --> 15:31.432
so maybe it's less expensive?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.390
Or...

15:33.391 --> 15:34.641
we don't have to.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.142
We don't have to.
I don't want it. It's okay.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.524
No, no, no, no, no.
‐ No. No. No.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.810
We're on the phone.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.153
‐ Hello?
‐ No, Mom doesn't want...

15:40.148 --> 15:41.398
Uh, Karen, yeah.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.899
- Can you just hold on a sec?
- Sure.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.440
‐ Listen, the, um‐‐
the big diamond

15:45.444 --> 15:46.534
that's‐‐that's a little showy.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.819
‐ No, I know.
We don't have to.

15:47.822 --> 15:51.242
‐ Maybe the Sparkling Dance
Heart Necklace

15:51.242 --> 15:52.952
is‐is more appropriate for 13.

15:52.952 --> 15:53.952
It's classy.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.543
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.368
Yeah. Hey, um, yeah, Karen.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.833
‐ Mom, we don't have to.
‐ Listen, is there any way

15:58.833 --> 16:00.293
- you could do layaway?
- Sure.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.793
- That won't be a problem.
- All right, good.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.674
And‐‐ooh, look.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.761
Two‐for‐one pizza.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.875
Antonio's. Boi‐oi‐oi‐oing!

16:06.883 --> 16:07.883
Yeah, okay.

16:07.884 --> 16:08.894
All right, are you ready?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.647
‐ Late much?

16:22.648 --> 16:24.478
Oh, my God, that's my gift.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.483
‐ Sorry.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.154
‐ Literally so expensive.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.453
‐ You guys.
‐ Sorry.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.066
‐ Sorry, he just stepped
on my gift.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.331
‐ Maya?
‐ What?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.633
‐ You know how Becca was like,
"Oh, there's, like, a sign

16:43.628 --> 16:45.208
so I know that God exists"?

16:45.213 --> 16:47.303
‐ Yeah.
‐ Like, I want that.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.298
‐ Okay.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.469
‐ But I'm not seeing it yet,

16:49.467 --> 16:51.927
so will you pray with me
so God hears?

16:51.928 --> 16:53.468
‐ Okay.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.475
God, if you exist,

17:05.483 --> 17:08.693
make the rabbi's handkerchief
fall when I open my eyes.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.634
Amen

17:30.758 --> 17:31.758
I'm blue

17:31.759 --> 17:33.589
Da ba dee da ba di

17:33.594 --> 17:37.274
Da ba dee da ba di
da ba dee da ba di

17:37.265 --> 17:41.095
Da ba dee da ba di
da ba dee da ba di

17:41.102 --> 17:44.732
Da ba dee da ba di
da ba dee da ba di

17:44.730 --> 17:47.020
Oh, my God, this party's,
like, unbelievable.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.453
Oh, my God!
They have Dippin' Dots.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.695
Oh, my God.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.487
‐ Okay, okay.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.370
I'm definitely gonna get
strawberry nanners.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.987
I'm getting it.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.286
Glow sticks!

18:01.289 --> 18:02.749
It's earth's poison.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.918
But I guess it doesn't matter.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.248
I don't care.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.463
‐ When should I give my present
to her?

18:09.463 --> 18:11.383
Should I give it now or later?

18:11.382 --> 18:13.182
‐ What?
‐ Okay, later.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.635
I'm gonna give it later
because I feel like

18:14.635 --> 18:17.305
she's not gonna
even pay attention to it now.

18:23.060 --> 18:27.610
Whatever Lola wants

18:27.607 --> 18:30.857
Lola gets

18:30.860 --> 18:33.110
And little man

18:33.112 --> 18:38.532
Little Lola wants you

18:38.534 --> 18:43.214
Make up your mind to have

18:43.205 --> 18:46.125
‐ She's so good.
‐  No regrets

18:46.125 --> 18:48.705
‐ That's why
it's musical‐theatre themed.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.711
Resign yourself

18:50.713 --> 18:52.093
You're through

18:54.675 --> 18:56.295
I always get

18:58.721 --> 19:02.891
What I aim for

19:02.892 --> 19:06.192
And your heart and soul

19:06.187 --> 19:11.857
Is what I came for

19:15.946 --> 19:18.696
Thank you guys so much
for coming to my bat mitzvah.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.699
As a woman,
I feel it's my responsibility

19:20.701 --> 19:22.621
to make sure you all have
a great time tonight.

19:22.620 --> 19:26.000
So let's make this party
super cool!

19:25.998 --> 19:27.878
Yeah!

19:36.425 --> 19:40.345
We are family

19:40.346 --> 19:44.266
I got all my sisters
with me

19:44.266 --> 19:48.396
We are family

19:48.396 --> 19:51.726
Get up everybody and sing

19:51.732 --> 19:55.032
We are family

19:55.027 --> 19:56.277
‐ What?

19:56.278 --> 19:57.908
You're not having fun?

19:59.657 --> 20:03.117
‐ No, I'm just not in the mood
right now.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.709
Yeah.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.325
You sufferin'?

20:09.333 --> 20:12.253
‐ Kinda, yeah.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.263
But I don't know.
It doesn't matter, actually.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.585
‐ Oh, see...

20:17.591 --> 20:18.881
I don't‐‐I don't agree
with that.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.104
There is nothing
that doesn't matter.

20:22.847 --> 20:26.347
You know...

20:26.350 --> 20:29.310
Becca's grandma always used
to say,

20:29.311 --> 20:32.611
"If you're lucky enough
to live...

20:32.606 --> 20:34.276
"live.

20:34.275 --> 20:37.895
"And if you get the chance
to dance...

20:39.822 --> 20:42.532
Dance."

20:42.533 --> 20:44.033
It's electric!

20:56.839 --> 20:58.799
You can't see it

20:58.799 --> 21:01.179
It's electric!

21:01.177 --> 21:03.097
You gotta feel it

21:03.095 --> 21:05.305
It's electric!

21:05.306 --> 21:07.516
Ooh, it's shakin'

21:07.516 --> 21:10.186
It's electric!

21:32.792 --> 21:37.552
Here, there, everywhere

21:37.546 --> 21:40.006
I've got to move

21:40.007 --> 21:41.297
Whoo!

21:41.300 --> 21:44.600
I'm going on a party ride

21:44.595 --> 21:47.215
I've got to groove,
groove, groove

21:47.223 --> 21:49.483
And from this music,
I just can't hide

21:52.978 --> 21:55.148
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.865
Sorry.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.748
Went in the wrong door.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.754
‐ Kone?

22:13.749 --> 22:14.879
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ It's me.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.745
- Steve.
- So embarrassing. Yeah.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.382
I see that.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.379
‐ Hey.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.170
‐ Hey.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.144
Sorry, I can't breathe.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.517
‐ It's cool. It's fine. It's...

22:29.515 --> 22:31.805
come on.

22:31.809 --> 22:32.979
Follow me.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.227
‐ Okay.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.199
‐ You know, Becca, you're,
like, so good at singing.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.737
‐ Thank you.
‐ Yeah, that's what
I was gonna say.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.490
You're, like, really good.
‐ Oh, you guys are so sweet.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.702
‐ Do you take, like, lessons
or...

22:49.702 --> 22:50.792
‐ I take a few,

22:50.786 --> 22:52.366
but I definitely just
love performing.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.751
‐ Yeah.
‐ You're a natural.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.377
‐ So good.
‐ Thanks.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.585
‐ Hi, Becca.

22:57.585 --> 22:58.785
Congratulations.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.504
It's so amazing.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.964
It's, like, awesome.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.474
‐ Thank you.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.636
‐ Um, I just‐‐I have my gift
for you,

23:06.635 --> 23:08.345
so I wanted you to open it.
‐ Oh, thanks.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.965
You could just put it
on the table behind me.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.272
‐ Or actually, can you‐‐

23:11.265 --> 23:12.885
it's just, like,
a really special gift,

23:12.892 --> 23:14.692
so if you don't mind,
just, like, open it.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.555
‐ Sure.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.609
You've been on my mind

23:26.614 --> 23:29.624
And I think it is the time

23:29.617 --> 23:31.947
To let you know

23:31.952 --> 23:34.162
‐ Do you wanna dance, Maya?

23:37.416 --> 23:40.456
What?

23:40.461 --> 23:41.551
‐ Do you wanna dance?

23:41.545 --> 23:42.545
‐ No, I heard you.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.006
I'm just like, "What?"

23:47.259 --> 23:51.059
No, 'cause you don't have
good shoes.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.885
‐ What?
‐ I'm just kidding.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.390
I'm just kidding. Sorry.
Can you‐‐

23:54.391 --> 23:56.101
I'm, like, in the middle
of something,

23:56.101 --> 23:57.651
so it's a little annoying.

23:57.645 --> 23:58.895
Oh, cute.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.436
I think I have
a couple of these,

24:00.439 --> 24:01.439
but thanks, Maya.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.780
So sweet.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.025
Is there, like, a receipt?

24:04.026 --> 24:05.896
- 'Cause you can return it.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.913
Thanks, Maya.
‐ You're welcome.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.105
Do you like it?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.744
Yeah, it's‐‐
it's really pretty.

24:10.741 --> 24:12.241
Thanks.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.292
Anyway, so we should have,
like, a slumber party.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.116
- Totally.
- Bring snacks.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.251
‐ Yeah!

24:20.918 --> 24:23.458
‐ One, two, three, four,

24:23.462 --> 24:26.382
five, six, seven, hold.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.842
One, two, three, four,

24:28.842 --> 24:31.762
five, six, seven, exhale.

24:31.762 --> 24:34.722
Working?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.687
Sorry.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.807
‐ You feeling better?

24:41.814 --> 24:43.074
‐ Yeah.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.685
I don't know what's happening.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.108
‐ Crème de menthe?

24:49.113 --> 24:50.953
‐ Okay.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.988
I don't...yeah.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.083
Thanks.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.253
Anna, where have you been?

25:01.250 --> 25:02.840
‐ Hi, Mai.
‐ What the hell? Like‐‐

25:02.835 --> 25:04.165
‐ Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.209
I just had, like,
a total freak‐out,

25:06.213 --> 25:07.923
and I just bumped into Steve.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.263
‐ Hi.
‐ He's just making me
feel better.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.468
‐ Hey.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.177
‐ Sorry, like...

25:12.177 --> 25:14.097
‐ You okay?

25:14.096 --> 25:15.256
‐ Yeah, no, I'm fine.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.524
It's just, like,
Becca opened the gift

25:16.515 --> 25:17.845
and didn't like it, so...

25:17.850 --> 25:20.350
‐ Sorry.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.152
‐ Want a drink?
‐ Oh, yeah.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.194
Did you drink?

25:25.190 --> 25:26.190
‐ Just a little,

25:26.191 --> 25:27.191
but I won't have more

25:27.192 --> 25:28.192
unless you want some.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.613
‐ No, I‐‐let's drink, damn it.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.531
‐ Yeah, and I love
this alcohol, actually.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.990
‐ Yeah, it's‐‐it's good

25:32.990 --> 25:35.280
because it doesn't make
your breath smell like alcohol,

25:35.284 --> 25:37.494
just minty fresh.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.504
‐ It burns.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.865
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.712
‐ Are you gonna get in trouble
for being out here?

25:42.916 --> 25:45.246
Fuck 'em.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.672
Fuck 'em.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.723
‐ Yeah.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.755
What do you guys think
happens when you die?

25:52.760 --> 25:55.640
‐ You rot.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.847
God doesn't exist.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.189
‐ Agreed.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.688
‐ Yeah.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.200
‐ Can I have your number?

26:15.199 --> 26:16.239
‐ What?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.791
‐ Uh, can I have your number?

26:18.786 --> 26:20.866
‐ Yeah, sure.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.247
‐ I don't usually go
for younger girls,

26:25.250 --> 26:27.250
but you're‐‐you're different.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.392
‐ Thanks.

27:16.718 --> 27:20.388
I should steal it back.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.559
Guys?

27:21.557 --> 27:22.887
Sorry, guys?

27:22.891 --> 27:25.391
Sorry, I think I should steal
the present back.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.864
'Cause my parents spent
a lot of money on it.

27:27.855 --> 27:28.895
Right?

27:28.897 --> 27:30.017
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.733
‐ 'Cause she doesn't even
know it's there.

27:31.733 --> 27:32.783
Like, she won't miss it.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.106
‐ Yeah, 'cause she's a bitch.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.701
‐ She sounds like a bitch.
‐ She was a bitch.

27:35.696 --> 27:36.946
‐ Take it back.
‐ Let's...

27:36.947 --> 27:38.317
‐ Okay!
‐ Fucking get your gift back.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.453
‐ Let's do it.
‐ Okay, so I'm doing it?

27:39.449 --> 27:40.779
‐ We're doing it.
‐ Okay, I'm doing it.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.794
Okay, fine. Oh, my God.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.156
Okay.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.787
‐ It's okay, be chill.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.456
‐ Are they looking?

27:49.459 --> 27:50.629
‐ Where? No.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.837
I see her. She's right there.
Go. Go.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.435
‐ This is my necklace,
and I'm taking it.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.689
Just taking it back. I got it.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.357
Oh, my God, is she looking?
‐ No, she's not looking.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.199
You are crazy

28:21.199 --> 28:22.779
You are a crazy girl

28:23.911 --> 28:26.001
I see the questions

28:25.996 --> 28:29.536
In your eyes

28:29.541 --> 28:35.171
I know what's weighing
on your mind

28:35.172 --> 28:37.592
You can be sure

28:37.591 --> 28:40.931
I know my part

28:40.928 --> 28:42.678
‐ You okay?
‐ Yeah.

28:42.679 --> 28:46.679
‐ Anna, may I have this dance?

28:46.683 --> 28:48.643
‐ Um, can Maya dance with us?

28:48.644 --> 28:50.524
‐ No, I don't want
to be a third wheel.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.060
‐ It's okay.
‐ No, I don't wanna.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.274
It's cool.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.903
It's all one wheel.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.361
‐ Yeah.

28:57.361 --> 28:58.451
It's one wheel.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.407
‐ Stop.
‐ I'm so drunk.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.527
I'm so drunk.

29:04.534 --> 29:07.374
And I swear

29:07.371 --> 29:12.831
By the moon and the stars
in the sky

29:12.834 --> 29:16.424
I'll be there

29:16.421 --> 29:17.631
I swear

29:17.631 --> 29:19.091
I'm a horse.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.551
Like a shadow

29:20.550 --> 29:24.470
That's by your side

29:24.471 --> 29:26.391
I'll be there

29:26.390 --> 29:30.140
Wait, are you into Steve?

29:30.143 --> 29:31.853
Like, are you guys going out?

29:31.853 --> 29:34.153
‐ Shh.
‐ He can't hear.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.150
He just asked for my number.

29:38.151 --> 29:41.151
‐ Oh, my God, okay.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.624
You have a boyfriend now!

29:43.615 --> 29:44.825
‐ Maya?
‐ What?

29:44.825 --> 29:46.275
You should meet
my friend Derrick.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.254
I think he'd really like you.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.785
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Stop!

29:50.789 --> 29:52.169
‐ Future boyfriend.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.995
‐ Shut up, Anna! No, I don't‐‐

29:54.001 --> 29:55.791
‐ He's cool, he's cool.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.634
‐ He's cool.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.420
‐ Wait, we're like...

30:00.424 --> 30:01.594
you guys.
‐ Like, yeah.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.681
Oh, my God, stop.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.348
We'll hang some memories

30:07.347 --> 30:11.227
On the walls

30:20.902 --> 30:23.112
‐ That's not what I wanted.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.579
‐ Hey, party girl.

30:29.578 --> 30:30.788
No hello?

30:30.787 --> 30:33.417
‐ Hey, Mam‐‐Mom.

30:36.585 --> 30:37.585
How was it?

30:37.586 --> 30:38.836
Was it fun?

30:40.338 --> 30:43.178
So fun.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.427
‐ Can I give you a hug?

30:48.430 --> 30:49.600
‐ Mm‐hmm.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.439
Mm.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.646
‐ Mm.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.860
‐ Have you been drinking?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.450
‐ No!

31:03.445 --> 31:06.235
What?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.869
Sorry.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.827
‐ What's going on with you?

31:20.921 --> 31:22.131
‐ Is it Maya?

31:22.130 --> 31:25.590
No, it's not Maya.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.262
It's you and Dad.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.721
It's you and Dad.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.722
And nothing matters.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.023
‐ I'm so sorry.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.859
You can always talk to me or...

31:45.862 --> 31:47.822
Spirit or...

31:47.823 --> 31:50.873
whatever,
if you feel overwhelmed.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.747
‐ Mm‐hmm.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.955
Thanks.

31:57.415 --> 32:01.795
Mm...
‐ But you don't need to drink.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.795
‐ Everything is spinning.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.224
Ugh.

32:08.218 --> 32:11.928
Will you lay down with me, Mom?

32:21.857 --> 32:24.107
Hold my hand.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.491
‐ You haven't wanted me
to hold your hand

32:28.488 --> 32:30.568
since you were eight.

32:42.878 --> 32:45.008
Thank you.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.415
I love you.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.974
‐ I love you too.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.358
‐ Mom.
‐ Hm?

33:09.362 --> 33:10.532
What is this?

33:10.530 --> 33:13.030
It's a necklace.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.413
Mm.

33:14.409 --> 33:17.449
‐ I'm sorry I made Dad
buy it for me.

33:19.664 --> 33:22.134
You can keep it, okay?
