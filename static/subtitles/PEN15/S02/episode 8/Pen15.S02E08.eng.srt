1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,845
Gonna have
some adventures

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,635
in this baby, huh, you guys?

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,430
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,643
Mm‐hmm.

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,943
‐ I can see the moon.

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,438
‐ Me too.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,940
‐ It's pretty cool.

8
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,703
I wonder if it's
different in, like, Florida.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,526
Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

10
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,593
It's gonna be fun.

11
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,681
‐ Yeah.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,980
‐  People are out
on the streets

13
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,977
Saying, "Hey"

14
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,939
‐  Walking towards me
all of the day

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,860
I don't know you, sir

16
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,448
But I wish
that I could know you

17
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,445
So I could say, "Hey, hey"

18
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,867
You say hey back to me

19
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,116
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,040
‐  Back in the day,
hey, hey, hey, hey

21
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,669
‐  Hey, hey

22
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,417
‐ Dad, are we gonna
be there soon?

23
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,670
‐ Curt, what time is it?
‐ Dad.

24
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,172
‐ Can I use your camcorder?

25
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,347
‐ Wow. Beautiful, no?

26
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:50,072
Why, yes, it is, Curt.
It is beautiful.

27
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,461
Whoo! We here.
Florida, baby.

28
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,497
Whoo!

29
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,801
‐ Dad, what are you doing?
You're getting further away.

30
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,965
I'm not gonna park
the car next to other cars.

31
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,505
That‐that's how
you get scratches.

32
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,508
You know that, right?

33
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,089
Doors open and ding the car.

34
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,474
‐ Dad.
‐ Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,061
Come on, Maya.
Don't play with the buttons.

36
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,926
‐ This is vacation.

37
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,313
Maya, get me. Get me.

38
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,311
‐ Okay.

39
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,562
‐ Hi.

40
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,523
‐ Hi.
‐ What's up?

41
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,363
Pose.

42
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,992
Whoa. Just recording.

43
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,370
We miss you, mom.

44
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,737
Yeah, but I wish
I was there with you.

45
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,624
The only vacations we went on
as a family were‐‐

46
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,671
‐ Were to Grammy and Grampy's
condo in Florida, I know.

47
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,126
But now you get
some alone time too.

48
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,585
You get a break from the kid.

49
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,745
Is your dad's
pink earring

50
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,134
sparkling in the Florida sun?

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,050
Mom, you're on speaker.
I love you.

52
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,932
I gotta go. We wanna swim.

53
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,469
Whoa.
Can't wait to jump in there.

54
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,392
Put Maya on with you,
please.

55
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,774
‐ I've gotta go, though.

56
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,230
I wanna talk
to both of you.

57
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,481
‐ Hi, Kathy.

58
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,192
Hi, Maya. Listen.

59
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,242
Both of you need to remember
you're in a strange place.

60
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,526
‐ We have a map.

61
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,989
Don't interrupt me,
sweetheart.

62
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,368
‐ Sorry, Kathy.

63
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,155
Girls are getting
kidnapped in Florida.

64
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,408
‐ Mom.
‐ If you see a cop,

65
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,870
sometimes they have
fake badges

66
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,039
and pretend to be cops
to get you in their car,

67
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,248
so just, you know,
be careful of that.

68
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,039
‐ That's not gonna happen.
‐ Wait, Kathy.

69
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,342
But if we do meet someone

70
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,245
that wants to do that to us,
should‐‐

71
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,804
Well, you should run

72
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,917
and use the whistle
I gave you.

73
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,553
‐ Okay, Mom.
Okay, I wanna go swim.

74
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,590
Love you. Bye.

75
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,892
‐ Bye. Love you, Kathy.

76
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,505
Love you too.

77
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,642
‐ Okay, Maya, let's go.

78
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,758
‐ Okay, let's go.

79
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,934
‐ Hey, hey. No. No, no, no.

80
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,773
You can't go in the pool
when there's thunder.

81
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,598
‐ Are you serious, Dad?

82
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,023
No one is letting us
start our good time.

83
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,072
‐ Oh, my God.

84
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,895
Hey, careful with that!

85
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,690
C'mon, let me see that.

86
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,494
You're not respecting it.

87
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,198
Okay, be back for dinner
at 5:00 p. m.

88
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,870
‐ 6:00.
‐ 5:00.

89
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,459
You're walking around.
That's it. No bodies of water.

90
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,205
Okay. We have to go, Dad.
We have to go.

91
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,496
‐ We have to go.

92
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,079
‐ Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
Hold it. Hold it.

93
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,254
‐ Dad!

94
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,052
‐ Take‐‐well, just a second.
Take this.

95
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,843
No, wait a minute, take‐‐

96
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,881
Dad!

97
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,144
Take this.

98
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,795
Oh, my god, Curt.

99
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,263
Now, that's all you get
for the whole trip, okay?

100
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,353
Thank you, Dad.

101
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,717
‐ So spend it wisely.

102
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,104
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ Are you sure?

103
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,480
‐ Don't buy expensive
water and stuff.

104
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,637
‐ Thank you. Love you.
‐ Okay?

105
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,984
‐ We'll be careful. Love you.

106
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,609
- We'll be economical.
- We have our map. Bye.

107
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,106
‐ Don't get ripped off.
‐ Love you. Bye.

108
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,777
‐ Love you, too.

109
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,452
Oh, my god.

110
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,528
‐ Oh, my God.
That guy's looking at me.

111
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,498
Hi.

112
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,537
C'mon, Anna. So cool.

113
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,250
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

114
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,085
‐ Do I look okay?

115
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,841
Maya, can you tell us
what we're getting?

116
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,602
This is umbrellas.

117
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,678
This, um, Canada Dry.

118
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,234
And this...

119
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,475
Ooh, whoa.

120
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,652
Can I hold the money?

121
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,360
It's more mine
'cause it's my dad's.

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,820
‐ Anna, he gave it
to both of us, so...

123
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,571
‐ I know, but you've had it
for a little while,

124
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,372
so I just want a chance
to hold it.

125
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,696
‐ Anna, and I'm gonna pay
for it, so hold on.

126
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,831
Like, let me hold it.

127
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,158
‐ Okay, whatever.

128
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,332
‐ $63.29.

129
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,751
‐ Okay.
Do we need all three umbrellas?

130
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,301
We do, right? Anna? Anna.

131
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,795
‐ C'mon, Maya. Hold on.

132
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,418
Beverly, I'm sorry. Sorry.

133
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,094
How much did you say
this one is, again?

134
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:47,183
‐ Um, Canada Dry is $5.63.

135
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,560
‐ And the Cherry Coke?

136
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:52,887
‐ $6.22.
‐ Oof.

137
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,943
Can I‐‐

138
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,162
‐ 'Na‐‐take the biggest gulp.

139
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,459
Wicked good artist.

140
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,376
‐ Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

141
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,378
We need that.

142
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,351
So pretty.

143
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,805
Wow, I love that.

144
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,265
‐ Excuse me, how much
would it cost for one of these?

145
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,016
‐ Two for $46.25.

146
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,436
$46.25.

147
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,269
That's the exact amount
we have.

148
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,991
‐ Kay. Adaria, here you go.

149
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,868
Maya, we're not gonna
have any money left.

150
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,115
‐ So pretty.
‐ Thank you.

151
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,237
‐ I have to have it.

152
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,623
‐ Okay.
We'd like to two, thank you.

153
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,961
Thank you.
We're gonna go next. Okay.

154
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,576
You sit‐‐okay.

155
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,213
‐ Don't move.
‐ Sorry.

156
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,499
‐ Anna, don't move.

157
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,962
‐ I'm not.

158
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,172
‐ I'm sitting still.

159
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,922
‐ You do? This is amazing.

160
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,561
Okay, done.

161
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,555
Take a look.

162
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,612
'Na, what?

163
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,862
What?

164
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,033
‐ Stop filming, Maya.
Please.

165
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,742
You liked it before.
Sorry.

166
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,952
‐ Please, please.

167
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,911
Okay, okay.

168
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,135
‐ I don't‐‐I don't look
like this, right?

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,560
Right, May?

170
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,426
‐ No, not at all. Do I?

171
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,233
‐ Oh, my God.
Honestly, not at all.

172
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,437
‐ I didn't know‐‐
‐ Do you swear?

173
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,436
No, you don't.
Not at all.

174
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,898
Hey.
How was it, you guys?

175
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,648
‐ Good.
‐ I'm pooping.

176
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,440
‐ Oh. Morning, Will Robinson.

177
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,356
You know, I like the town.
It's a tourist trap.

178
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,124
I went for a run.
Bottle of water?

179
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,656
- Hide it. Hide it.
- $3.22.

180
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,869
- I am.
- Okay.

181
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,578
Don't get
bamboozled here, okay?

182
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,368
‐ Bamboozled? No. No.

183
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,583
Put it in the thing.

184
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,002
‐ Put it away. Okay.
‐ It was not worth it.

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,090
‐ Where?
‐ Beneath. Like, at the bottom.

186
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,666
Oh, my God.

187
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,350
Are you awake?

188
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,815
Yeah. Are you?

189
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,275
Yeah.

190
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,236
What are you thinking about?

191
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,411
‐ I don't know.
I guess I'm just awake.

192
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,537
Yeah.

193
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,245
Um...

194
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,840
sorry it's not fun yet.

195
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,378
No, it is.
I swear, it really is.

196
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,945
'Na?

197
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,065
'Na? 'Na!

198
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,993
Yeah? What?

199
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,542
What's‐‐

200
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,788
Honey, it's sunny.

201
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,542
It's a beautiful day.
It's calling our name.

202
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,753
‐ Dad. Turn it off.
‐ Please, Curt, please.

203
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,554
‐ All right, all right,
all right.

204
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,635
How are you
liking everything?

205
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,927
Mmm.

206
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,891
‐ You happy
with the sausage patties?

207
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,141
Did you try dipping them
in the syrup?

208
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:07,023
‐ Uh, I‐I have in my life,
yeah, but, um, I haven't here.

209
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,573
I'm gonna do that.
That's great.

210
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,897
‐ Hi there.

211
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,532
You don't have
a lot on your plate.

212
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,859
Need something?

213
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,203
‐ I'm fat.

214
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,078
‐ Anna, tell Maya
it's not true.

215
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,115
‐ No, I am too.

216
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,408
I wanna stay inside.

217
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,790
‐ Huh?
‐ I want to stay inside.

218
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,289
‐ I‐I guess I know now why
they call 'em teenagers, right?

219
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,542
Are the waters free?

220
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,174
‐ No. Enjoy your day.

221
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,671
‐ Thank you.

222
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,263
Hey, what's with the faces,
you guys?

223
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,759
You were dying
to go out yesterday.

224
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,050
Don't leave your dear
old dad lonely.

225
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,514
C'mon.

226
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,024
Don't you wanna get those
hair braids she's rocking?

227
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,806
‐ You happy
with the sausage patties?

228
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,100
Mm...

229
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,863
It's on me.

230
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,145
‐ Am I tan yet?

231
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,663
‐ No idea. Am I?
My face feels huge.

232
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,695
‐ It's not. It's not. Is my‐‐

233
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,622
‐ No. No.
‐ Yeah.

234
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,540
She's pretty.

235
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,964
‐ Water, water, water. $1.30.

236
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,301
Looking sweaty. Cool down.

237
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,047
- Are you thirsty?
- Yeah.

238
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,219
It's a good price.
Cheapest on the block.

239
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,509
‐ We don't have any‐‐
‐ Money, yeah.

240
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,482
It's hot.

241
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,608
Wow.

242
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,855
That's how
it's supposed to look?

243
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,777
Hmm. Thank you.

244
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,570
I'm telling you,
she tried on this swimsuit,

245
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,073
and I swear...

246
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,382
The beach. Anna, oh, my god.

247
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,630
- The beach!
- Go, go, go.

248
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,801
I'm gonna splash
your ass.

249
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,928
‐ Ah, bad news.

250
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,086
Storm off of St. Lucia
brought in the jellyfish.

251
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,854
- You're too slow.
- Guys. Guys.

252
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,137
Jellyfish.
No swimming today.

253
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,476
Bummer.

254
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,032
‐ Ow.
‐ Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

255
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,870
‐ Oh, shit, I forgot something.
Um, it's in the room.

256
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,827
I'll be right back, okay?

257
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,332
‐ Ow, ow. Ow.

258
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,712
‐ It's a tan, right?
'Cause you look burned.

259
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,629
‐ So do you.

260
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,973
‐ Ow, Maya, it's not ready
to come off yet.

261
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:37,965
‐ Sorry.

262
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,046
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

263
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,930
Naño couldn't get a ball
if he tried.

264
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,637
‐ Okay, and Ray Rogers can?

265
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,507
He's a joke player, okay?

266
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,274
‐ Feels like we'd all eat
pepperoni pizza together.

267
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,811
‐ Are you hot?

268
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,313
‐ No.

269
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,899
‐ Hey.

270
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,610
‐ Oh, hey.
‐ Hey.

271
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,701
‐ Are you...on a mouse?

272
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,739
JK. Are you on vacation?

273
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,663
‐ Yeah. Are you?

274
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,582
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

275
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,460
‐ What room are you in?

276
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,037
‐ 39K5.
‐ 39K5.

277
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,753
‐ That's close to K9, right?

278
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,173
Like, as in dogs?

279
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,381
My brother's a K9 cop,
and, uh, it smells for drugs.

280
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,762
Arrest me.

281
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,178
JK.

282
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,724
‐ I love dogs.

283
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,562
‐ Me too.
‐ Yeah.

284
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,927
‐ Yeah.

285
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,933
‐ Yeah.

286
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,444
‐ Yeah.

287
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,687
‐ Where are you guys?
What floor?

288
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,979
‐ We are in, uh, 21L4.

289
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,822
Four, four, four.

290
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,373
‐ Four, four, four.

291
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,448
‐ You two are cute.

292
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,043
‐ You really are.
It's, like, crazy.

293
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,250
‐ You've been to In Da Club?

294
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,340
‐  In da club
on a late night

295
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,455
Feeling right looking

That's awesome.

299
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,767
But have you guys
been to that club?

300
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,847
‐ It's tonight,
for 16 and under.

301
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,153

00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,276
‐ Peace.
‐ Peace.

307
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,489
‐ Wait, what are your names?

308
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,160
‐ Ralph.

309
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,699
‐ We're Anna and Maya.

‐ Bye. Later. Peace.

311
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,672

312
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,378

318
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,731
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah!

Boo, boo, boo, boo!

00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:06,447
I'm gonna pee my pants!

321
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,067
Um, Anna and I wanna
have your babies!

322
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,744
‐ Maya. Stop. Are you serious?

323
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,919
Wait, do I look okay?

324
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,376

‐ You don't have
the right room.

331
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,807
‐ Oh.

332
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,520
‐ Um, this is 21L4, right?
‐ Yeah.

333
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,901

In Da Club.

334
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,647
‐ Oh, yeah.
In In Da Club, you're right.

335
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,689
Okay.

Oh, my God!

Wait, wait, wait!

340
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,407
‐ So you're‐‐
you're not responsible

341
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,412
for picking out
the ice machine, are you?

342
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,464
'Cause this one‐‐
‐ It's a nice one.

343
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,747
‐ It's great.
‐ Dad.

344
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,880
Can we go to the town?

345
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,127
‐ And chase the boys?

346
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,748
‐ Dad.
‐ We want to explore the town,

347
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,344
and I have my whistle,
so, like‐‐

348

00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,223
Um, is it safe for them
to just, you know, hang?

352
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,473
‐ Oh, yeah.

353
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,234
There's a lot
of kid‐centered activities.

354
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,226
I say yeah.

355

Love you. 8:00.

359
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,277
Have fun, you guys.

360
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,778
Kids.

361
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,949
‐ Okay, this is crazy,

362
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,753
but, like, what if
one of use marries them?

363
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,247
Or both of us. Like‐‐

364
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,538
I know. I know this is crazy,
but I sort of feel that.

365
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,213
‐ Right?
‐ I know!

366
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,923
They said
that they think we're cute.

367
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,923
Oh, my God.

368
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,224
‐ Oh, my God.

369
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,757

you know?

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,970
And they're, like, so nice,
which is crazy. Like‐‐

00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,771

‐ Let me see your ID.

375
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,440
‐ Um...

376
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,990
oh, I, um, don't have one,
but, um‐‐do you, Anna?

377
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,284
‐ I'm, um, only 13, so no.

00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,743

379
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,293

380
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,746
‐ Well, right this way, then.

381
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,367
‐ Thank you so much, sir.

382
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,584
‐ Thank you.

383
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,009
‐ Something to drink?

384
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,220
‐ No, thank you.

385
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,180
‐ If you wanna stay
in In Da Club,

386
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,890
you have to order something.

387
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,730
Oh.

388
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,185
‐ We'll be right‐‐yeah,
we'll be right back.

389
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,687
'Cause we don't have any money.

390
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,775
He's so cool.

391
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,776
‐ Ew, Anna.
You're, like, grinding.

392
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,004
‐ Maya.

393
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,036
Do you know Freddy or Ralph?

394
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,869
‐ Nah.

395
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,134
Hey.

396
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,958
‐ Trying to be Black much,
Blondie?

397
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,343
‐ What?
‐ Huh? What? Nothin'.

398
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,090
‐ What?
‐ Jenny, Venice.

399
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,343
God.

400
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,604
Oh, his friends.

401
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,182
‐ Want me to take your picture?

402
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,733
Do you want me
to take your picture?

403
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,939
‐ Yeah.

404
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,441
Thank you.

405
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,413
‐ Thanks.
Um, you're pressing the flash.

406
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,985
It's the button on top.

407
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,581
‐ Wow, you're so pretty.

408
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,576
‐ Aww.

409
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,447
I just got a new straightener.

410
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,664
‐ Aww.

411
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,083
We're trying to meet up
with these guys

412
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,831
that we might go out with,
but‐‐

413
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:50,003
‐ Oh, really? It's still early.
This is Ben. He's single.

414
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,514
‐ That is not the truth.

415
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,915
‐ Are these the girls
you were talking about?

416
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,434
‐ Maybe.
‐ That's so mean.

417
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,757
They're not that bad.

418
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,432
‐ He calls girls butt ugly
all the time.

419
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,640
It's so messed up.

420
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,060
Well, he's never
called you that.

421
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,098
He's obsessed with you.

422
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,600
He has. He has before.

423
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,692
‐ I didn't mean it, though.
I was mad when I said that.

424
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,807
You're hot.

425
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,733
‐ Oh, my God,
you made them sad.

426
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,032
Look, you girls
aren't ugly at all.

427
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,895
He's just an asshole.

428
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,782
‐ I don't care
what that fool thinks.

429
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,239
He looks like he wipes his anus
with toilet bowl brushes.

430
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,406
‐ Oh, my gosh.

431
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,409
‐ I'm waiting to meet
some real men.

432
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,081
‐ Okay.
‐ You're so funny.

433
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,000
Sorry, you have
to drink with us.

434
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,458
‐ He has a tiny dick.

435
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,668
‐ You guys are like
the little sisters I never had.

436
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,473
Aww.

437
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,716
‐ We look like you a little.
‐ Yeah.

438
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,548
We do.

439
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,644
‐  Sister, sister

440
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,520
‐  Never know how much 
‐  I miss her

441
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,313
I ain't ever gonna
let you go

442
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,147
‐ Three virgin
strawberry daiquiris.

443
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,280
‐ Thank you, ma'am.

444
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,026
‐ Two more, please,
for my girls.

445
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,358
‐ Thank you so much.

446
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,493
‐ Oh, my God. Thank you.

447
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,700
Oh, my God.

448
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,828
‐ Give them some.

449
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,250
‐ There's only a little left.

450
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,328
‐ C'mon, think about
how funny it'll be.

451
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,543
Please?

452
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,553
‐ Here, take that. Take that.

453
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,005
Here, here. Hurry up, hurry up.
You're going too slow.

454
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,505
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

455
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,838
‐ That's so much.

456
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,934
Whoo!

457
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,429
‐ Oh, yo, even this song?

458
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,061
‐ Venice, dance with me.

459
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,137
‐ Yeah. Okay.

460
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,864
‐ The weather's really nice.

461
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,778
‐ So, um...

462
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,743
‐ Oh, my God.

463
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,568
I've always wanted to do this.

464
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,033
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

465
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,582
I've‐‐yeah, I've always
wanted to do that.

466
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,747
Oh, whoa

467
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,591
‐ I am the candy man!

468
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,086
Oh, whoa

469
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,837
‐ Coming from Mounty Land!

470
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,089
‐ Whoo!

471
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,970
‐ Oh, my God. Maya.

472
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,547
That guy is looking at you.
You're a hottie.

473
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,059
He looks way too old
to be in here.

474
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,427
Get him to buy us nips, slut.

475
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,064
‐ I don't know him, psycho.

476
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,730
‐ Oh, my God, I do.
I know him. I know him.

477
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,610
Yes!

478
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,135
‐ Yeah?

479
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,218
‐ Hi, again.

480
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,854
So you don't know
Ralph and Freddy, or you do?

481
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,562
Or are you related?

482
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,193
‐ What do you want me to say?

483
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,820
That you know them.

484
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,359
I don't.

485
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,784
‐ Oh.

486
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,872
Our friends want you
to buy them, um‐‐

487
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,788
uh, never mind.

488
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,247
‐ Alcohol?
‐ Yeah.

489
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,038
‐ I don't care. Sure.

490
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,343
‐ Oh, my God,
what just happened?

491
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,418
‐ Got it!

492
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,303
‐ Go, girl! Go, girl!

493
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,640
‐ Got it! Got it!

494
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,985
‐ Hi, ugly.

495
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,457
There she is.

496
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,881
‐ Anna! Worm with me.

497
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,217
Where were you?
I got us alcohol.

498
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,809
‐ The bathroom.
I feel, like, sad.

499
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,015
‐ Oh, no.

500
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,175
Okay, Anna needs
to catch up, you guys.

501
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,233
‐ Ben, give Anna the rest
of your drink.

502
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,307
‐ Yeah.

503
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,692
‐ More is coming
'cause of them.

504
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:26,778
‐ Anna. Oh, my Go‐‐whoo!

505
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,410
Yes! Go!

506
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,368
Oh, my God,
you're gonna be wasted.

507
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,000
‐ I usually hate
the taste of alcohol,

508
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,957
but I love
fermented strawberry.

509
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,338
I could have, like, so much.

510
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,875
‐ Oh, my God, drink mine too.

511
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,590
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.
I just want her to have it.

512
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,177
‐ Okay, alcoholic.

513
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,058
‐ Thank you.
I have a big mouth. Thank you.

514
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:56,016
Love you guys.
Love you so much.

515
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,938
‐ You okay, 'Na?

516
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,437
‐ Whoo!

517
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,438
You're drunk!

518
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,570
‐ You are.

519
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,567
‐ He's back.
Your friend is back, Maya.

520
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,110
He's kinda creepy.

521
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,703
Ben, go talk to him
so we don't have to.

522
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,409
‐ Oh, my God, Ben's hot.

523
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,303
‐ Oof.

524
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,795
‐ You got it?

525
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,217
‐ Yeah, he got us so much.

526
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,295
But he was just
kicked out of here

527
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,179
'cause your friend is,
like, 32.

528
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:33,346
‐ Ew. He's so old.
Good job, guys.

529
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,267
‐ Lower, lower.

530
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,175
‐ I love you guys.

531
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,194
‐ Oh, my God. Anna, no.

532
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,396
‐ Babe. No.

533
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,318
‐ Sorry, there's a lot going on
in my life.

534
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,487
And the guy I like didn't come.

535
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,106
‐ It's okay.

536
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,623
‐ The guy I like didn't come.

537
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,445
‐ Aww, you're a sad drunk.

538
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,790
‐ My parents hate each other.
I'm stupid.

539
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,827
‐ You got me though.
You got me.

540
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,962
Ay‐ya‐ya!
‐ Oh, she's a fun one.

541
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,539
‐ I'm pissed, too,
they didn't come.

542
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,884
They're assholes.

543
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,708
‐ Don't say that, Maya.

544
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,804
Maybe it's still early.
What time is it?

545
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,180
9:00.

546
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:15,306
‐ Damn, we're supposed
to be back at 8:00, Anna.

547
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,555
No.

548
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,517
‐ Be careful of the old guy
on the way back.

549
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,687
I would go with you,

550
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,395
but I don't wanna leave
those two alone.

551
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,975
‐ Fuck you.
‐ Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay.

552
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,821
Jenny, Venice, Ben, love you.

553
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:26,856
‐ Bye, guys. Love you.

554
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,609
‐ Bye.

555
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,495
‐ Get off me. I'm good.

556
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,535
‐ Okay, okay. Get up. Get up.

557
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,959
‐ Is this the right way?
‐ Oh, my God. Be normal.

558
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,249
Be normal, Anna.

559
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,219
‐ Anna. Anna, is that the guy?

560
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,143
‐ Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
C'mon, Anna. Shh.

561
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,979
Please, please get up, please.

562
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,045
Shit. Shit.
It's a cop. It's a cop.

563
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,795
Oh, my God,
but it could be a fake cop.

564
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,972
‐ Come on, come on, come, come.

565
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,219
Look, when we see your dad,
don't say a lot, okay?

566
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:39,852
And if you, like,
need to lean on me,

567
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,098
then just say
you hurt your ankle.

568
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,391
‐ Mm.

569
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,693
You're my uncle.

570
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,146
‐ Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

571
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,568
Shh, shh.

572
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,316
Be quiet. Your dad.

573
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,948
Hello?

574
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,156
Okay, c'mon.

575
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,485
C'mon.

576
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,493
‐ Ow.

577
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,004
Are you okay?

578
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,495
Did you hurt yourself?

579
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,131
I'm ugly.

580
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,128
‐ Huh?

581
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,669
‐ I'm ugly.

582
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,934
‐ Anna, no, you're not. I am.
Why would you say that?

583
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,138
‐ No, you loo‐‐you're perfect.

584
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,140
God made my‐‐made me, like‐‐

585
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,232
like he was on crack.

586
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:30,228
Forgot he was doing a human,
not a mountain.

587
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,942
Mountain.

588
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,362
My nose is like
a wedge of cheese.

589
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:38,161
‐ No, I am the cheese, Anna.
I'm, like, a whole round of it.

590
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,696
I'm a whole round of it.
Do you understand?

591
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,752
My face is literally
as round as the moon!

592
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,325
Do you get that?

593
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,540
You get that
in your thick skull?

594
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,211
I have a freaking round face,

595
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,499
and my face is hairier
than a bat!

596
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,424
I have a hairy, fat, round face

597
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,513
like a freaking fat,
hairy bat moon!

598
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,309
How would you feel?

599
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,965
Oh, my God, where'd you go?

600
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,189
‐ Oh, my God. Get up. Okay.
Get up. Get up. Get up.

601
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,646
‐ Throw up.

602
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,767
Oh, God.

603
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,033
What?

604
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,145
Shh. Shh. Oh, my God.

605
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:20,033
Oh, my God. Lay down.
Lay down. Lay down. Lay down.

606
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,922
Anna.

607
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,576
Anna?

608
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,004
Hmm.

609
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,552
‐ You okay?
Are you feeling okay?

610
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,177
‐ She's sick, I think. Um...

611
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,505
Oh, okay.

612
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,561
You don't have a fever.

613
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,516
Anna. Are you drunk?

614
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:52,268
‐ Dad...fuck you.

615
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,322
‐ What?

616
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,276
‐ You're not my mom, I get it.

617
00:28:56,276 --> 00:29:00,406
‐ Maya, what‐‐what happened?
How could you let this happen?

618
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,275
‐ Um...um...yeah.

619
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,373
The‐‐these younger kids, um,

620
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,330
were, like‐‐
they had alcohol and‐‐

621
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,670
‐ Okay, tell me.

622
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,745
‐ They were going home
and they told us

623
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,000
to hold it for them.
‐ Okay.

624
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,551
‐ And then, like, Anna sipped
the tiniest bit

625
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,835
just to, like, see if they were
gonna be okay on it.

626
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,009
‐ Yes.
‐ Um, and we were, like‐‐

627
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,468
we were just, like,
really scared coming home.

628
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,719
And then, like,
you weren't here,

629
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
and so we were scared
and, like, we just‐‐

630
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,432
‐ Just‐‐I'm gonna call 911.

631
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,982
I'm scared.

632
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,306
Hello. Um, yeah. Hi.

633
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,190
This is Curtis Kone.
I'm at the Tropicana Hotel.

634
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,518
And, um...

635
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:40,614
My daughter is, um, drunk.

636
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,202
She's‐‐she's 13.

637
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,239
Yeah, at the Hotel Tropicana,
yes.

638
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,583
‐ Don't press charges.

639
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,458
‐ Anna, how‐‐
Maya, how much did Anna‐‐

640
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,666
Anna, how much did you drink?

641
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,337
‐ Fuck you.

642
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,125
‐ Um, a couple, um, sips.

643
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:01,049
Okay, just‐‐just, um,
a couple of sips.

644
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,429
Oh, okay.

645
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,597
Right. All right.

646
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,305
Uh...

647
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,385
maybe it's mixed in with
food poisoning, I don't know.

648
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,152
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

649
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,572
You can't get alcohol poisoning
from a couple of sips.

650
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,857
‐ Wh‐what's that?

651
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,401
When you've had
too much to drink

652
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,704
and you have to go
to the hospital to get it out.

653
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,449
Anna? Sweetheart?

654
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:32,002
You're in trouble.
But I love you.

655
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,997
You'll feel better
after getting it out.

656
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,589
Don't tell him.

657
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:44,377
‐ Anna. Anna.
I just told your dad, okay?

658
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,894
You have to remember.

659
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:49,176
Some younger kids
came with alcohol.

660
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,931
We were trying to help them‐‐
Anna.

661
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:56,023
We were trying‐‐Anna, I didn't
ask the guy to buy it for us.

662
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Anna. Anna. Anna.

663
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,964
Anna. Anna.

664
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,384
‐ When we wake up, your dad is
gonna ask us where we were.

665
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,643
Remember what we were saying?

666
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,756
What?

667
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,933
‐ You asked the old guy
to buy it for us.

668
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,852
And then we drank it.
We drank so much.

669
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,311
‐ No. No. Try again.

670
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,192
Kids had it, and we drank it
to protect them.

671
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,070
So who got it for us?
‐ You did.

672
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:46,947
‐ No. Anna. Try again.
So who got it for us?

673
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:47,947
‐ You.

674
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,331
Are you gonna
say something?

675
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,499
Dad?

676
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,997
‐ I‐I‐‐I don't even have
the words

677
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,379
for how disappointed in you
I am.

678
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,377
I didn't think you were
that kind of a kid.

679
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,919
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

680
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:08,592
‐ Dad, can you please focus?
Like, not on your date? Please?

681
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,353
‐ Aline and I are just friends.

682
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,505
‐ Oh, yeah,
you didn't kiss her?

683
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,854
Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

684
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:14,849
I don't wanna know.

685
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,230
‐ I did.
‐ Dad‐‐

686
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,306
‐ It made me feel really bad.

687
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,481
And I will do things
differently next time.

688
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,320
And young lady,
I hope you do too.

689
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,816
‐ Yes, of course.

690
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,858
Any little amount
to drink is wrong.

691
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,412
And it's a cruel lesson
that you got the stomach flu,

692
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,316
Anna, on the same night
as your bad behavior.

693
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,544
‐ So what happened, again?

694
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,245
You didn't drink
anything, Maya?

695
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,615
Just Anna did?

696
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,251
‐ We were going home.

697
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,828
Little kids gave us
their alcohol.

698
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,963
They were so little.
I was really nervous over them.

699
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,591
And she tasted it just a little

700
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,008
to see if they would get
too drunk, and‐‐

701
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,086
So it didn't have
anything to do with those boys?

702
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,381
Bad influences?

703
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,844
‐ Dad, we never saw them again.

704
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,104
But when‐‐when we did,

705
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,885
they were‐‐they were
perfect gentlemen.

706
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,059
‐ They ditched us
probably 'cause I'm butt ugly.

707
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,557
‐ No, it's my fault.
Maya, you're gorgeous.

708
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,810
My nose is, like,
so disgusting.

709
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,022
‐ My face is so big and ugly.

710
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,693
‐ You guys are both gorgeous.

711
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,397
Thanks, Curt.

712
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,453
They ditched you, huh?

713
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,698
I'm trying to think
of something to say

714
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,449
to make it better, but, uh...

715
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,287
Um‐‐

716
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,038
But, you know, we had
a little experience together.

717
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,711
Didn't we?

718
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,669
And we're better off
than we were, right?

719
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,749
Not really.

720
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,674
‐ No, I really like them.

721
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,342
‐ So that's an easy answer.

722
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,261
Give them the benefit
of the doubt.

723
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,429
And if they screw you over
again, fuck them.

724
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,269
Be the Anna and Maya
I know you are.

725
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,475
‐ Curt, how?
We're leaving today. Like...

726
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,846
Aline said we can use
the pool till 4:00.

727
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,653
Maybe they'll come back.

728
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:56,827
Okay.
We have a good time here, huh?

729
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,196
‐ Yeah.

730
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,123
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Thanks, Dad.

731
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,751
‐ We didn't even get
their screen names.

732
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,039
Yeah.

733
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,803
For the email messages?

734
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:07,995
Fuck 'em.

735
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,514
‐ It's called AIM.
‐ Oh.

736
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,756
‐ It's not email.

737
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,877
‐ Sorry.
‐ Oh, my God.

738
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,974
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

739
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,389
That's‐‐that's them.
That's them.

740
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,847
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, that's them.

741
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,386
‐ One sec. Dad, dad, dad.
One sec. Stop.

742
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,770
Stop just for a second.

743
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,702
Be chill. Be chill.

744
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,158
Hey.

745
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,157
‐ Oh, my God, hey.

746
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,039
Whoa, what are you guys,
like, doing here?

747
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,196
‐ Whoa.

748
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,914
‐ Nothing.
What are you looking for?

749
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,924
‐ Yeah, my earring dropped.

750
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,457
‐ It's in your ear.

751
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,972
‐ Freddy, we hoped
we'd see you guys again

752
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,677
in, like‐‐in In Da Club.
‐ Yeah, we went your room too,

753
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,007
but maybe we, like, heard
the number wrong or something.

754
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,893
‐ Maya. Maya.
‐ No, no.

755
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,889
I thought about it all night.
I couldn't sleep.

756
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,102
Like‐‐
‐ Same.

757
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,312
We felt like we were
supposed to be with you.

758
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,773
Make sure you were okay.

759
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,782
But, like, um, he got grounded

760
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,856
'cause his mom found out
we used the jacuzzi again.

761
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,072
‐ So stupid. Not her.

762
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,582
‐ Oh.
‐ The situation.

763
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,405
‐ Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

764
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,620
‐ We aren't actually
staying here.

765
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,460
‐ Yeah.
Uh, we just live nearby.

766
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,376
Not here. So our bad.

767
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,335
‐ Yeah,
but we've waiting out here

768
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,876
'cause maybe you'd walk by
and we say hi.

769
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,971
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

770
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,546
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

771
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,142
‐ Like, now we're leaving.

772
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,968
Fuck it all, like‐‐

773
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,354
‐ Um, can we have
your screen names, maybe?

774
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,352
‐ Anna!

775
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:50,403
‐ Sorry.
‐ Okay, yeah.

776
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,818
‐ Don't lose them.

777
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,566
‐ Oh, my God, they're gone.
JK.

778
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,069
‐ You ladies are funny.

779
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,911
‐ I don't wanna leave you,
hon, like‐‐

780
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,526
‐ Yeah, hon, me too.
I really, really don't.

781
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,293
‐ You have the gum
to remember us by.

782
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,655
You're, like, the shit.

783
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,123
‐ Can we have
something of yours?

784
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,542
‐ Okay.

785
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,601
‐ Here.
‐ Here.

786
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,478
‐ I'll treasure it, babe.

787
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,595
‐ Forever, baby.

788
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,101
‐ Enjoy it, baby. Think of me.

789
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,694
‐ Stay safe, okay?

790
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,819
‐ Bye.

791
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,015
‐ Bye, hon. Bye.

792
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,324
‐ Bye, babe.

793
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,567
‐ Bye.

794
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,815
‐ I can see it on your face.

795
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,833
You got a perfect ending.

796
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,325
Smile.
‐ Dad, stop.

797
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,326
‐ Oh, my God, Curt.

798
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,497
‐ Stop.
‐ Please, stop.

799
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,905
‐ I know, it's annoying.

800
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:51,293
But you'll look back on this
and really, like‐‐maybe.

801
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,172
You'll get that
someday, sweetie.
