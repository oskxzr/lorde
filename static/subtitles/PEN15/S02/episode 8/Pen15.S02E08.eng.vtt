WEBVTT

00:10.385 --> 00:11.845
Gonna have
some adventures

00:11.845 --> 00:14.635
in this baby, huh, you guys?

00:14.640 --> 00:16.430
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:16.433 --> 00:17.643
Mm‐hmm.

00:17.643 --> 00:20.943
‐ I can see the moon.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.438
‐ Me too.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.940
‐ It's pretty cool.

00:25.943 --> 00:29.703
I wonder if it's
different in, like, Florida.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.526
Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.593
It's gonna be fun.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.681
‐ Yeah.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.980
‐  People are out
on the streets

00:59.977 --> 01:01.977
Saying, "Hey"

01:01.979 --> 01:04.939
‐  Walking towards me
all of the day

01:04.940 --> 01:06.860
I don't know you, sir

01:06.858 --> 01:10.448
But I wish
that I could know you

01:10.445 --> 01:12.445
So I could say, "Hey, hey"

01:12.447 --> 01:14.867
You say hey back to me

01:14.866 --> 01:18.116
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

01:18.120 --> 01:21.040
‐  Back in the day,
hey, hey, hey, hey

01:21.039 --> 01:23.669
‐  Hey, hey

01:23.667 --> 01:26.417
‐ Dad, are we gonna
be there soon?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.670
‐ Curt, what time is it?
‐ Dad.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.172
‐ Can I use your camcorder?

01:37.347 --> 01:41.347
‐ Wow. Beautiful, no?

01:45.772 --> 01:50.072
Why, yes, it is, Curt.
It is beautiful.

01:59.661 --> 02:03.461
Whoo! We here.
Florida, baby.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.497
Whoo!

02:06.501 --> 02:08.801
‐ Dad, what are you doing?
You're getting further away.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.965
I'm not gonna park
the car next to other cars.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.505
That‐that's how
you get scratches.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.508
You know that, right?

02:14.509 --> 02:16.089
Doors open and ding the car.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.474
‐ Dad.
‐ Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.061
Come on, Maya.
Don't play with the buttons.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.926
‐ This is vacation.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.313
Maya, get me. Get me.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.311
‐ Okay.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.562
‐ Hi.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.523
‐ Hi.
‐ What's up?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.363
Pose.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.992
Whoa. Just recording.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.370
We miss you, mom.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.737
Yeah, but I wish
I was there with you.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.624
The only vacations we went on
as a family were‐‐

02:42.621 --> 02:45.671
‐ Were to Grammy and Grampy's
condo in Florida, I know.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.126
But now you get
some alone time too.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.585
You get a break from the kid.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.745
Is your dad's
pink earring

02:50.754 --> 02:53.134
sparkling in the Florida sun?

02:54.800 --> 02:57.050
Mom, you're on speaker.
I love you.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.932
I gotta go. We wanna swim.

02:58.929 --> 03:02.469
Whoa.
Can't wait to jump in there.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.392
Put Maya on with you,
please.

03:05.394 --> 03:06.774
‐ I've gotta go, though.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.230
I wanna talk
to both of you.

03:09.231 --> 03:10.481
‐ Hi, Kathy.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.192
Hi, Maya. Listen.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.242
Both of you need to remember
you're in a strange place.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.526
‐ We have a map.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.989
Don't interrupt me,
sweetheart.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.368
‐ Sorry, Kathy.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.155
Girls are getting
kidnapped in Florida.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.408
‐ Mom.
‐ If you see a cop,

03:21.410 --> 03:22.870
sometimes they have
fake badges

03:22.869 --> 03:25.039
and pretend to be cops
to get you in their car,

03:25.038 --> 03:27.248
so just, you know,
be careful of that.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.039
‐ That's not gonna happen.
‐ Wait, Kathy.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.342
But if we do meet someone

03:30.335 --> 03:32.245
that wants to do that to us,
should‐‐

03:32.254 --> 03:33.804
Well, you should run

03:33.797 --> 03:34.917
and use the whistle
I gave you.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.553
‐ Okay, Mom.
Okay, I wanna go swim.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.590
Love you. Bye.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.892
‐ Bye. Love you, Kathy.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.505
Love you too.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.642
‐ Okay, Maya, let's go.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.758
‐ Okay, let's go.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.934
‐ Hey, hey. No. No, no, no.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.773
You can't go in the pool
when there's thunder.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.598
‐ Are you serious, Dad?

03:48.603 --> 03:51.023
No one is letting us
start our good time.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.072
‐ Oh, my God.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.895
Hey, careful with that!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.690
C'mon, let me see that.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.494
You're not respecting it.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.198
Okay, be back for dinner
at 5:00 p. m.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.870
‐ 6:00.
‐ 5:00.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.459
You're walking around.
That's it. No bodies of water.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.205
Okay. We have to go, Dad.
We have to go.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.496
‐ We have to go.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.079
‐ Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
Hold it. Hold it.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.254
‐ Dad!

04:12.252 --> 04:14.052
‐ Take‐‐well, just a second.
Take this.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.843
No, wait a minute, take‐‐

04:17.841 --> 04:18.881
Dad!

04:18.884 --> 04:20.144
Take this.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.795
Oh, my god, Curt.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.263
Now, that's all you get
for the whole trip, okay?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.353
Thank you, Dad.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.717
‐ So spend it wisely.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.104
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ Are you sure?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.480
‐ Don't buy expensive
water and stuff.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.637
‐ Thank you. Love you.
‐ Okay?

04:29.644 --> 04:30.984
‐ We'll be careful. Love you.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.609
- We'll be economical.
- We have our map. Bye.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.106
‐ Don't get ripped off.
‐ Love you. Bye.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.777
‐ Love you, too.

04:37.652 --> 04:41.452
Oh, my god.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.528
‐ Oh, my God.
That guy's looking at me.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.498
Hi.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.537
C'mon, Anna. So cool.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.250
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.085
‐ Do I look okay?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.841
Maya, can you tell us
what we're getting?

05:04.012 --> 05:06.602
This is umbrellas.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.678
This, um, Canada Dry.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.234
And this...

05:13.605 --> 05:15.475
Ooh, whoa.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.652
Can I hold the money?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.360
It's more mine
'cause it's my dad's.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.820
‐ Anna, he gave it
to both of us, so...

05:20.821 --> 05:22.571
‐ I know, but you've had it
for a little while,

05:22.572 --> 05:24.372
so I just want a chance
to hold it.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.696
‐ Anna, and I'm gonna pay
for it, so hold on.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.831
Like, let me hold it.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.158
‐ Okay, whatever.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.332
‐ $63.29.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.751
‐ Okay.
Do we need all three umbrellas?

05:34.751 --> 05:37.301
We do, right? Anna? Anna.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.795
‐ C'mon, Maya. Hold on.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.418
Beverly, I'm sorry. Sorry.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.094
How much did you say
this one is, again?

05:43.093 --> 05:47.183
‐ Um, Canada Dry is $5.63.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.560
‐ And the Cherry Coke?

05:48.557 --> 05:52.887
‐ $6.22.
‐ Oof.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.943
Can I‐‐

06:02.362 --> 06:05.162
‐ 'Na‐‐take the biggest gulp.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.459
Wicked good artist.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.376
‐ Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.378
We need that.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.351
So pretty.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.805
Wow, I love that.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.265
‐ Excuse me, how much
would it cost for one of these?

06:31.266 --> 06:34.016
‐ Two for $46.25.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.436
$46.25.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.269
That's the exact amount
we have.

06:40.901 --> 06:44.991
‐ Kay. Adaria, here you go.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.868
Maya, we're not gonna
have any money left.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.115
‐ So pretty.
‐ Thank you.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.237
‐ I have to have it.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.623
‐ Okay.
We'd like to two, thank you.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.961
Thank you.
We're gonna go next. Okay.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.576
You sit‐‐okay.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.213
‐ Don't move.
‐ Sorry.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.499
‐ Anna, don't move.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.962
‐ I'm not.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.172
‐ I'm sitting still.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.922
‐ You do? This is amazing.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.561
Okay, done.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.555
Take a look.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.612
'Na, what?

07:25.612 --> 07:26.862
What?

07:26.863 --> 07:29.033
‐ Stop filming, Maya.
Please.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.742
You liked it before.
Sorry.

07:30.742 --> 07:31.952
‐ Please, please.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.911
Okay, okay.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.135
‐ I don't‐‐I don't look
like this, right?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.560
Right, May?

07:53.556 --> 07:55.426
‐ No, not at all. Do I?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.233
‐ Oh, my God.
Honestly, not at all.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.437
‐ I didn't know‐‐
‐ Do you swear?

07:58.436 --> 08:00.436
No, you don't.
Not at all.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.898
Hey.
How was it, you guys?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.648
‐ Good.
‐ I'm pooping.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.440
‐ Oh. Morning, Will Robinson.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.356
You know, I like the town.
It's a tourist trap.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.124
I went for a run.
Bottle of water?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.656
- Hide it. Hide it.
- $3.22.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.869
- I am.
- Okay.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.578
Don't get
bamboozled here, okay?

08:15.578 --> 08:18.368
‐ Bamboozled? No. No.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.583
Put it in the thing.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.002
‐ Put it away. Okay.
‐ It was not worth it.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.090
‐ Where?
‐ Beneath. Like, at the bottom.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.666
Oh, my God.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.350
Are you awake?

08:42.105 --> 08:43.815
Yeah. Are you?

08:43.815 --> 08:46.275
Yeah.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.236
What are you thinking about?

08:50.071 --> 08:54.411
‐ I don't know.
I guess I'm just awake.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.537
Yeah.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.245
Um...

09:02.250 --> 09:03.840
sorry it's not fun yet.

09:05.128 --> 09:08.378
No, it is.
I swear, it really is.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.945
'Na?

09:30.945 --> 09:33.065
'Na? 'Na!

09:33.073 --> 09:35.993
Yeah? What?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.542
What's‐‐

09:41.998 --> 09:43.788
Honey, it's sunny.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.542
It's a beautiful day.
It's calling our name.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.753
‐ Dad. Turn it off.
‐ Please, Curt, please.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.554
‐ All right, all right,
all right.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.635
How are you
liking everything?

09:55.637 --> 09:57.927
Mmm.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.891
‐ You happy
with the sausage patties?

09:59.891 --> 10:02.141
Did you try dipping them
in the syrup?

10:02.143 --> 10:07.023
‐ Uh, I‐I have in my life,
yeah, but, um, I haven't here.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.573
I'm gonna do that.
That's great.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.897
‐ Hi there.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.532
You don't have
a lot on your plate.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.859
Need something?

10:13.863 --> 10:15.203
‐ I'm fat.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.078
‐ Anna, tell Maya
it's not true.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.115
‐ No, I am too.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.408
I wanna stay inside.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.790
‐ Huh?
‐ I want to stay inside.

10:22.789 --> 10:26.289
‐ I‐I guess I know now why
they call 'em teenagers, right?

10:26.292 --> 10:27.542
Are the waters free?

10:27.544 --> 10:30.174
‐ No. Enjoy your day.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.671
‐ Thank you.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.263
Hey, what's with the faces,
you guys?

10:34.259 --> 10:35.759
You were dying
to go out yesterday.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.050
Don't leave your dear
old dad lonely.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.514
C'mon.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.024
Don't you wanna get those
hair braids she's rocking?

10:42.016 --> 10:43.806
‐ You happy
with the sausage patties?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.100
Mm...

10:45.103 --> 10:46.863
It's on me.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.145
‐ Am I tan yet?

10:53.153 --> 10:55.663
‐ No idea. Am I?
My face feels huge.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.695
‐ It's not. It's not. Is my‐‐

10:59.742 --> 11:02.622
‐ No. No.
‐ Yeah.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.540
She's pretty.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.964
‐ Water, water, water. $1.30.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.301
Looking sweaty. Cool down.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.047
- Are you thirsty?
- Yeah.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.219
It's a good price.
Cheapest on the block.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.135
‐ Yeah?

21:46.138 --> 21:48.218
‐ Hi, again.

21:48.224 --> 21:51.854
So you don't know
Ralph and Freddy, or you do?

21:51.852 --> 21:54.562
Or are you related?

21:54.563 --> 21:56.193
‐ What do you want me to say?

21:56.190 --> 21:59.820
That you know them.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.359
I don't.

22:03.364 --> 22:04.784
‐ Oh.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.872
Our friends want you
to buy them, um‐‐

22:07.868 --> 22:09.788
uh, never mind.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.247
‐ Alcohol?
‐ Yeah.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.038
‐ I don't care. Sure.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.343
‐ Oh, my God,
what just happened?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.418
‐ Got it!

22:21.423 --> 22:23.303
‐ Go, girl! Go, girl!

22:23.300 --> 22:26.640
‐ Got it! Got it!

22:46.365 --> 22:47.985
‐ Hi, ugly.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.457
There she is.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.881
‐ Anna! Worm with me.

23:03.757 --> 23:07.217
Where were you?
I got us alcohol.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.809
‐ The bathroom.
I feel, like, sad.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.015
‐ Oh, no.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.175
Okay, Anna needs
to catch up, you guys.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.233
‐ Ben, give Anna the rest
of your drink.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.307
‐ Yeah.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.692
‐ More is coming
'cause of them.

23:22.318 --> 23:26.778
‐ Anna. Oh, my Go‐‐whoo!

23:26.780 --> 23:29.410
Yes! Go!

23:29.408 --> 23:33.368
Oh, my God,
you're gonna be wasted.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.000
‐ I usually hate
the taste of alcohol,

23:34.997 --> 23:37.957
but I love
fermented strawberry.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.338
I could have, like, so much.

23:39.335 --> 23:40.875
‐ Oh, my God, drink mine too.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.590
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.
I just want her to have it.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.177
‐ Okay, alcoholic.

23:49.178 --> 23:52.058
‐ Thank you.
I have a big mouth. Thank you.

23:52.056 --> 23:56.016
Love you guys.
Love you so much.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.938
‐ You okay, 'Na?

23:57.937 --> 23:59.437
‐ Whoo!

23:59.438 --> 24:01.438
You're drunk!

24:01.440 --> 24:03.570
‐ You are.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.567
‐ He's back.
Your friend is back, Maya.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.110
He's kinda creepy.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.703
Ben, go talk to him
so we don't have to.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.409
‐ Oh, my God, Ben's hot.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.303
‐ Oof.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.795
‐ You got it?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.217
‐ Yeah, he got us so much.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.295
But he was just
kicked out of here

24:27.299 --> 24:29.179
'cause your friend is,
like, 32.

24:29.176 --> 24:33.346
‐ Ew. He's so old.
Good job, guys.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.267
‐ Lower, lower.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.175
‐ I love you guys.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.194
‐ Oh, my God. Anna, no.

24:39.186 --> 24:42.396
‐ Babe. No.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.318
‐ Sorry, there's a lot going on
in my life.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.487
And the guy I like didn't come.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.106
‐ It's okay.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.623
‐ The guy I like didn't come.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.445
‐ Aww, you're a sad drunk.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.790
‐ My parents hate each other.
I'm stupid.

24:56.787 --> 24:59.827
‐ You got me though.
You got me.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.962
Ay‐ya‐ya!
‐ Oh, she's a fun one.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.539
‐ I'm pissed, too,
they didn't come.

25:03.544 --> 25:04.884
They're assholes.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.708
‐ Don't say that, Maya.

25:06.714 --> 25:09.804
Maybe it's still early.
What time is it?

25:09.800 --> 25:11.180
9:00.

25:11.176 --> 25:15.306
‐ Damn, we're supposed
to be back at 8:00, Anna.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.555
No.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.517
‐ Be careful of the old guy
on the way back.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.687
I would go with you,

25:19.685 --> 25:21.395
but I don't wanna leave
those two alone.

25:21.395 --> 25:23.975
‐ Fuck you.
‐ Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.821
Jenny, Venice, Ben, love you.

25:25.816 --> 25:26.856
‐ Bye, guys. Love you.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.609
‐ Bye.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.495
‐ Get off me. I'm good.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.535
‐ Okay, okay. Get up. Get up.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.959
‐ Is this the right way?
‐ Oh, my God. Be normal.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.249
Be normal, Anna.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.219
‐ Anna. Anna, is that the guy?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.143
‐ Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
C'mon, Anna. Shh.

25:57.139 --> 26:00.979
Please, please get up, please.

26:25.125 --> 26:28.045
Shit. Shit.
It's a cop. It's a cop.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.795
Oh, my God,
but it could be a fake cop.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.972
‐ Come on, come on, come, come.

26:35.969 --> 26:38.219
Look, when we see your dad,
don't say a lot, okay?

26:38.222 --> 26:39.852
And if you, like,
need to lean on me,

26:39.848 --> 26:42.098
then just say
you hurt your ankle.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.391
‐ Mm.

26:43.393 --> 26:44.693
You're my uncle.

26:44.686 --> 26:48.146
‐ Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.568
Shh, shh.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.316
Be quiet. Your dad.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.948
Hello?

26:53.946 --> 26:56.156
Okay, c'mon.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.485
C'mon.

26:59.493 --> 27:00.493
‐ Ow.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.004
Are you okay?

27:01.995 --> 27:04.495
Did you hurt yourself?

27:07.251 --> 27:09.131
I'm ugly.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.128
‐ Huh?

27:10.129 --> 27:13.669
‐ I'm ugly.

27:13.674 --> 27:17.934
‐ Anna, no, you're not. I am.
Why would you say that?

27:17.928 --> 27:21.138
‐ No, you loo‐‐you're perfect.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.140
God made my‐‐made me, like‐‐

27:24.142 --> 27:26.232
like he was on crack.

27:26.228 --> 27:30.228
Forgot he was doing a human,
not a mountain.

27:30.232 --> 27:31.942
Mountain.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.362
My nose is like
a wedge of cheese.

27:34.361 --> 27:38.161
‐ No, I am the cheese, Anna.
I'm, like, a whole round of it.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.696
I'm a whole round of it.
Do you understand?

27:41.702 --> 27:43.752
My face is literally
as round as the moon!

27:43.745 --> 27:45.325
Do you get that?

27:45.330 --> 27:47.540
You get that
in your thick skull?

27:47.541 --> 27:49.211
I have a freaking round face,

27:49.209 --> 27:52.499
and my face is hairier
than a bat!

27:52.504 --> 27:54.424
I have a hairy, fat, round face

27:54.423 --> 27:57.513
like a freaking fat,
hairy bat moon!

27:57.509 --> 28:01.309
How would you feel?

28:01.305 --> 28:02.965
Oh, my God, where'd you go?

28:05.559 --> 28:08.189
‐ Oh, my God. Get up. Okay.
Get up. Get up. Get up.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.646
‐ Throw up.

28:10.647 --> 28:11.767
Oh, God.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.033
What?

28:13.025 --> 28:16.145
Shh. Shh. Oh, my God.

28:16.153 --> 28:20.033
Oh, my God. Lay down.
Lay down. Lay down. Lay down.

28:25.162 --> 28:28.922
Anna.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.576
Anna?

28:30.584 --> 28:32.004
Hmm.

28:32.002 --> 28:35.552
‐ You okay?
Are you feeling okay?

28:35.547 --> 28:38.177
‐ She's sick, I think. Um...

28:38.175 --> 28:41.505
Oh, okay.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.561
You don't have a fever.

28:44.556 --> 28:48.516
Anna. Are you drunk?

28:48.518 --> 28:52.268
‐ Dad...fuck you.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.322
‐ What?

28:54.316 --> 28:56.276
‐ You're not my mom, I get it.

28:56.276 --> 29:00.406
‐ Maya, what‐‐what happened?
How could you let this happen?

29:00.405 --> 29:03.275
‐ Um...um...yeah.

29:03.283 --> 29:06.373
The‐‐these younger kids, um,

29:06.370 --> 29:08.330
were, like‐‐
they had alcohol and‐‐

29:08.330 --> 29:09.670
‐ Okay, tell me.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.745
‐ They were going home
and they told us

29:11.750 --> 29:13.000
to hold it for them.
‐ Okay.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.551
‐ And then, like, Anna sipped
the tiniest bit

29:15.545 --> 29:17.835
just to, like, see if they were
gonna be okay on it.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.009
‐ Yes.
‐ Um, and we were, like‐‐

29:20.008 --> 29:22.468
we were just, like,
really scared coming home.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.719
And then, like,
you weren't here,

29:23.720 --> 29:25.720
and so we were scared
and, like, we just‐‐

29:25.722 --> 29:27.432
‐ Just‐‐I'm gonna call 911.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.982
I'm scared.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.306
Hello. Um, yeah. Hi.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.190
This is Curtis Kone.
I'm at the Tropicana Hotel.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.518
And, um...

29:35.524 --> 29:40.614
My daughter is, um, drunk.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.202
She's‐‐she's 13.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.239
Yeah, at the Hotel Tropicana,
yes.

29:46.243 --> 29:48.583
‐ Don't press charges.

29:48.578 --> 29:51.458
‐ Anna, how‐‐
Maya, how much did Anna‐‐

29:51.456 --> 29:53.666
Anna, how much did you drink?

29:53.667 --> 29:55.337
‐ Fuck you.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.125
‐ Um, a couple, um, sips.

29:57.129 --> 30:01.049
Okay, just‐‐just, um,
a couple of sips.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.429
Oh, okay.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.597
Right. All right.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.305
Uh...

30:07.305 --> 30:10.385
maybe it's mixed in with
food poisoning, I don't know.

30:10.392 --> 30:13.152
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

30:15.272 --> 30:18.572
You can't get alcohol poisoning
from a couple of sips.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.857
‐ Wh‐what's that?

30:20.861 --> 30:22.401
When you've had
too much to drink

30:22.404 --> 30:25.704
and you have to go
to the hospital to get it out.

30:25.699 --> 30:28.449
Anna? Sweetheart?

30:28.452 --> 30:32.002
You're in trouble.
But I love you.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.997
You'll feel better
after getting it out.

30:33.999 --> 30:37.589
Don't tell him.

30:40.297 --> 30:44.377
‐ Anna. Anna.
I just told your dad, okay?

30:44.384 --> 30:45.894
You have to remember.

30:45.886 --> 30:49.176
Some younger kids
came with alcohol.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.931
We were trying to help them‐‐
Anna.

30:51.933 --> 30:56.023
We were trying‐‐Anna, I didn't
ask the guy to buy it for us.

31:15.040 --> 31:19.040
Anna. Anna. Anna.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.964
Anna. Anna.

31:22.464 --> 31:25.384
‐ When we wake up, your dad is
gonna ask us where we were.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.643
Remember what we were saying?

31:27.636 --> 31:29.756
What?

31:29.763 --> 31:31.933
‐ You asked the old guy
to buy it for us.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.852
And then we drank it.
We drank so much.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.311
‐ No. No. Try again.

31:37.312 --> 31:40.192
Kids had it, and we drank it
to protect them.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.070
So who got it for us?
‐ You did.

31:42.067 --> 31:46.947
‐ No. Anna. Try again.
So who got it for us?

31:46.947 --> 31:47.947
‐ You.

31:51.701 --> 31:54.331
Are you gonna
say something?

31:54.329 --> 31:55.499
Dad?

31:55.497 --> 31:57.997
‐ I‐I‐‐I don't even have
the words

31:57.999 --> 32:00.379
for how disappointed in you
I am.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.377
I didn't think you were
that kind of a kid.

32:02.379 --> 32:03.919
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

32:03.922 --> 32:08.592
‐ Dad, can you please focus?
Like, not on your date? Please?

32:08.593 --> 32:10.353
‐ Aline and I are just friends.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.505
‐ Oh, yeah,
you didn't kiss her?

32:12.514 --> 32:13.854
Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

32:13.849 --> 32:14.849
I don't wanna know.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.230
‐ I did.
‐ Dad‐‐

32:16.226 --> 32:18.306
‐ It made me feel really bad.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.481
And I will do things
differently next time.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.320
And young lady,
I hope you do too.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.816
‐ Yes, of course.

32:24.818 --> 32:26.858
Any little amount
to drink is wrong.

32:26.862 --> 32:29.412
And it's a cruel lesson
that you got the stomach flu,

32:29.406 --> 32:31.316
Anna, on the same night
as your bad behavior.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.544
‐ So what happened, again?

32:33.535 --> 32:35.245
You didn't drink
anything, Maya?

32:35.245 --> 32:36.615
Just Anna did?

32:36.621 --> 32:38.251
‐ We were going home.

32:38.248 --> 32:39.828
Little kids gave us
their alcohol.

32:39.833 --> 32:42.963
They were so little.
I was really nervous over them.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.591
And she tasted it just a little

32:44.588 --> 32:46.008
to see if they would get
too drunk, and‐‐

32:46.006 --> 32:48.086
So it didn't have
anything to do with those boys?

32:48.091 --> 32:49.381
Bad influences?

32:49.384 --> 32:50.844
‐ Dad, we never saw them again.

32:50.844 --> 32:52.104
But when‐‐when we did,

32:52.095 --> 32:53.885
they were‐‐they were
perfect gentlemen.

32:53.889 --> 32:56.059
‐ They ditched us
probably 'cause I'm butt ugly.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.557
‐ No, it's my fault.
Maya, you're gorgeous.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.810
My nose is, like,
so disgusting.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.022
‐ My face is so big and ugly.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.693
‐ You guys are both gorgeous.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.397
Thanks, Curt.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.453
They ditched you, huh?

33:11.448 --> 33:12.698
I'm trying to think
of something to say

33:12.699 --> 33:14.449
to make it better, but, uh...

33:15.827 --> 33:18.287
Um‐‐

33:18.288 --> 33:21.038
But, you know, we had
a little experience together.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.711
Didn't we?

33:22.709 --> 33:24.669
And we're better off
than we were, right?

33:24.669 --> 33:25.749
Not really.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.674
‐ No, I really like them.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.342
‐ So that's an easy answer.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.261
Give them the benefit
of the doubt.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.429
And if they screw you over
again, fuck them.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.269
Be the Anna and Maya
I know you are.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.475
‐ Curt, how?
We're leaving today. Like...

33:39.476 --> 33:41.846
Aline said we can use
the pool till 4:00.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.653
Maybe they'll come back.

33:52.447 --> 33:56.827
Okay.
We have a good time here, huh?

33:56.826 --> 33:58.196
‐ Yeah.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.123
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Thanks, Dad.

34:00.121 --> 34:02.751
‐ We didn't even get
their screen names.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.039
Yeah.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.803
For the email messages?

34:06.795 --> 34:07.995
Fuck 'em.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.514
‐ It's called AIM.
‐ Oh.

34:09.506 --> 34:10.756
‐ It's not email.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.877
‐ Sorry.
‐ Oh, my God.

34:12.884 --> 34:13.974
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.389
That's‐‐that's them.
That's them.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.847
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, that's them.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.386
‐ One sec. Dad, dad, dad.
One sec. Stop.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.770
Stop just for a second.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.702
Be chill. Be chill.

34:34.698 --> 34:36.158
Hey.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.157
‐ Oh, my God, hey.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.039
Whoa, what are you guys,
like, doing here?

34:40.036 --> 34:41.196
‐ Whoa.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.914
‐ Nothing.
What are you looking for?

34:42.914 --> 34:45.924
‐ Yeah, my earring dropped.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.457
‐ It's in your ear.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.972
‐ Freddy, we hoped
we'd see you guys again

34:53.967 --> 34:55.677
in, like‐‐in In Da Club.
‐ Yeah, we went your room too,

34:55.677 --> 34:58.007
but maybe we, like, heard
the number wrong or something.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.893
‐ Maya. Maya.
‐ No, no.

34:59.889 --> 35:02.889
I thought about it all night.
I couldn't sleep.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.102
Like‐‐
‐ Same.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.312
We felt like we were
supposed to be with you.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.773
Make sure you were okay.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.782
But, like, um, he got grounded

35:11.776 --> 35:13.856
'cause his mom found out
we used the jacuzzi again.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.072
‐ So stupid. Not her.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.582
‐ Oh.
‐ The situation.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.405
‐ Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:20.410 --> 35:21.620
‐ We aren't actually
staying here.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.460
‐ Yeah.
Uh, we just live nearby.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.376
Not here. So our bad.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.335
‐ Yeah,
but we've waiting out here

35:29.336 --> 35:32.876
'cause maybe you'd walk by
and we say hi.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.971
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.546
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.142
‐ Like, now we're leaving.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.968
Fuck it all, like‐‐

35:42.974 --> 35:45.354
‐ Um, can we have
your screen names, maybe?

35:45.352 --> 35:46.352
‐ Anna!

35:46.353 --> 35:50.403
‐ Sorry.
‐ Okay, yeah.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.818
‐ Don't lose them.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.566
‐ Oh, my God, they're gone.
JK.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.069
‐ You ladies are funny.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.911
‐ I don't wanna leave you,
hon, like‐‐

35:57.906 --> 36:00.526
‐ Yeah, hon, me too.
I really, really don't.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.293
‐ You have the gum
to remember us by.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.655
You're, like, the shit.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.123
‐ Can we have
something of yours?

36:07.832 --> 36:09.542
‐ Okay.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.601
‐ Here.
‐ Here.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.478
‐ I'll treasure it, babe.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.595
‐ Forever, baby.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.101
‐ Enjoy it, baby. Think of me.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.694
‐ Stay safe, okay?

36:30.689 --> 36:31.819
‐ Bye.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.015
‐ Bye, hon. Bye.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.324
‐ Bye, babe.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.567
‐ Bye.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.815
‐ I can see it on your face.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.833
You got a perfect ending.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.325
Smile.
‐ Dad, stop.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.326
‐ Oh, my God, Curt.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.497
‐ Stop.
‐ Please, stop.

36:45.495 --> 36:46.905
‐ I know, it's annoying.

36:46.913 --> 36:51.293
But you'll look back on this
and really, like‐‐maybe.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.172
You'll get that
someday, sweetie.
