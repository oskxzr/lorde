WEBVTT

00:33.700 --> 00:35.330
‐ Oh, God.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.947
You can't put that there.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.464
‐ Oh, where can I put it, then?

00:38.455 --> 00:39.825
I've got waiters
coming in and out.

00:39.831 --> 00:42.171
Just somewhere not in the way.

00:50.050 --> 00:54.140
One, two, a‐one, two, one, two.

01:32.134 --> 01:37.474
I, I am hiding

01:37.472 --> 01:44.102
The you I show to you
is just a lie

01:44.104 --> 01:47.194
You take what you want,
you get what you take

01:47.190 --> 01:50.570
Lie
‐  High, high, high

01:50.569 --> 01:53.409
‐ Maya!
Are you ready?

01:53.405 --> 01:54.905
Come on, let's go!

01:54.906 --> 01:56.276
‐ Wait, Mom,
you're making onigiri?

01:56.283 --> 01:58.043
‐ Yeah.
‐ No, I want a turkey sandwich.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.405
‐ Oh, go get dressed.

01:59.411 --> 02:00.621
Go get dressed.
You'll catch cold.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.080
‐ Okay, but can you make
a turkey sandwich?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.830
‐ I will.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.172
Mom!

02:05.167 --> 02:07.957
Can you help me find
my HitClip?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.591
I can't find it!
Mom, come on!

02:09.588 --> 02:12.048
Ah.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.929
Okay!
Coming.

02:13.925 --> 02:17.425
I last saw it
in the living room.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.809
I have it!

02:18.805 --> 02:19.805
- Give it back!
-  I have it

02:19.806 --> 02:21.266
I love this song

02:21.266 --> 02:23.136
‐ Maya, give it back!
‐  Za‐la‐la‐la‐la‐‐

02:23.143 --> 02:24.813
‐ Stop! Shuji!
‐ Shuji, stop!

02:24.811 --> 02:25.901
‐ Just 'cause we're
half‐siblings doesn't mean

02:25.896 --> 02:27.186
you get to keep half my stuff!

02:27.189 --> 02:28.819
‐ Don't say that!
We're brother‐sister, you‐‐

02:28.815 --> 02:30.185
‐ Shuji, stop it!
‐ No, we're not, you idiot.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.532
Half, half.
‐ Ow!

02:31.526 --> 02:34.106
Mom, just tell him to stop!
‐ Just‐‐just stop.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.912
Give him that "Shit Grip" back.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.736
Huh?

02:37.741 --> 02:39.661
‐ Did you just call it "shit"?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.290
Mom, that's not
what it's called.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.496
It's called a HitClip.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.497
Say it again, say it again.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.538
‐ HitGrip.
‐ No!

02:46.541 --> 02:48.381
HitClip!
‐ HitGrip!

02:48.377 --> 02:49.877
‐ Say "Oreo McFlurry."

02:49.878 --> 02:51.048
‐ Oh, Maya, no.
‐ Say it!

02:51.046 --> 02:52.916
‐ Come on, do it.
You got it.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.593
‐ Oleo MacFurry.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.546
Enough!
Okay, go get ready‐‐

02:57.552 --> 02:59.012
Go!

02:59.012 --> 03:00.762
Shuji!

03:00.764 --> 03:02.524
- Go get dressed.
- You bitch!

03:02.516 --> 03:04.806
- Breakfast ready.
- Come on.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.606
‐ Yuki!
‐ Yes, Fred?

03:10.607 --> 03:13.147
You think I need
to wear a coat today?

03:13.151 --> 03:15.861
‐ I don't know.
It's in the 60s.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.782
So not a cardigan.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.081
You think I need
to wear a coat?

03:20.075 --> 03:22.695
‐ Cardigan or coat,
whatever you like.

03:22.703 --> 03:26.293
Come on, everybody,
breakfast is ready!

03:26.289 --> 03:28.039
Hurry up!

03:30.043 --> 03:32.633
Oh, honey,
this looks beautiful.

03:32.629 --> 03:36.589
Ugh, I am so hungry.
This is great.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.221
Uh‐‐oh, hey,
do we have any hot sauce?

03:39.219 --> 03:42.469
Yeah.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.102
Ugh, I'm sorry, it's gone.

03:44.099 --> 03:48.059
So I'll get it this afternoon.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.901
‐ Shut up.
‐ Get off of me.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.316
‐ Stop.
Just give it to me.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.775
‐ No.

03:53.775 --> 03:57.065
Get away, you annoying freak.
‐ Mom!

03:57.070 --> 03:59.610
‐ Maya, enough.
Shut up.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.414
‐ Oh, my God, Mom, you just
told your daughter to shut up.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.659
What's wrong with you?
‐ Maya, stop it.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.332
‐ That's crazy.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.581
What a big bite.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.504
Ay, ay, ay, ay, yah.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.302
Oh, it's‐‐that's Kathy.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.006
‐ I didn't even eat.
‐ You were late, so come on.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.257
‐ I got to go, too.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.088
‐ Don't forget to bring‐‐
take everything.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.513
I'm seeing Frank and his trio.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.483
Oh, honey,
can you call Richard?

04:26.475 --> 04:28.725
He's gonna ask
about the tour dates.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.057
Can you just give him a call?
‐ Okay.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.061
‐ Thank you.
‐ Bye.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.612
‐ All right.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.686
‐ Oh!

04:34.691 --> 04:38.491
Maya, Shuji!
Your lunches!

04:41.656 --> 04:42.776
‐ Bye.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.697
Bitch.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.185
‐ No parking
if you're not handicapped.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.321
‐ Bitch.
‐ You don't have a sign.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.899
‐ Bitch, bitch.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.382
I'm sorry.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.824
Mm‐hmm.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.810
‐ No.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.850
Mm.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.480
Yuki...

10:16.116 --> 10:17.116
‐ Mm.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.485
‐ Oh, I‐‐
I got to go.

11:53.588 --> 11:54.758
Ah.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.181
Hello, Doctor?

12:02.180 --> 12:04.770
Yeah, this is Yuki.

12:04.766 --> 12:08.766
I can't make it today, uh,
can I reschedule, please?

12:10.271 --> 12:13.821
Oh, okay.
Good‐‐goodbye, Doctor.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.450
‐ Mm.
Ah...

12:20.448 --> 12:22.028
‐ Ah, mm.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.486
‐ Ah.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.080
Eh?

13:13.459 --> 13:14.459
‐ Ah.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.554
‐ Okay.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.411
Mm.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.109
‐ Mm.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.299
‐ You knowing English and
working as an interpreter

15:23.297 --> 15:25.337
inspired me to learn English.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.051
It's what helped me
get this job.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.261
‐ Wow, that's very good.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.262
Yeah.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.723
‐ Arigato.
‐ Ooh‐‐

15:32.723 --> 15:34.433
‐ Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.893
It's okay.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.234
It's okay.
It's only my boobs.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.480
Your boobs?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.696
‐ Stevie Wonder?

17:03.522 --> 17:05.572
No.
‐ Yes.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.439
Ah!

18:26.439 --> 18:27.899
‐ Eh?

18:37.325 --> 18:38.775
Ah.

20:27.977 --> 20:31.267
If you see me walkin'
down the street

20:31.272 --> 20:36.362
And I start to cry
each time we meet

20:36.360 --> 20:41.160
Walk on by

20:41.157 --> 20:44.827
Walk on by

20:44.827 --> 20:49.077
Make believe that you don't
see the tears

20:49.081 --> 20:52.961
Just let me grieve
in private

20:52.960 --> 20:55.670
'Cause each time I see you

20:55.671 --> 21:00.261
I break down and cry

21:00.259 --> 21:02.799
Walk on by

21:02.803 --> 21:05.263
Don't stop

21:05.264 --> 21:07.734
Walk on by

21:07.725 --> 21:10.185
Don't stop

21:10.186 --> 21:16.776
Walk on by

21:16.776 --> 21:20.106
I just can't
get over losin' you

21:20.112 --> 21:25.122
And so if I seem
broken and blue

21:25.117 --> 21:29.957
Walk on by

21:29.955 --> 21:33.535
Walk on by

21:33.542 --> 21:37.672
Foolish pride,
that's all that I have left

21:37.671 --> 21:40.381
So let me hide

21:40.382 --> 21:44.222
The tears and the sadness
you gave me

21:44.220 --> 21:47.560
When you said goodbye...

24:22.544 --> 24:25.514
‐ Hey. I didn't know when you
were gonna come home,

24:25.506 --> 24:27.796
so I made
my world‐famous daddy chili.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.800
‐ Were the kids okay?
‐ Yes, yeah, they loved it.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.553
They're in their rooms.
They're fine.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.144
Oh, and I got
some more hot sauce

24:34.139 --> 24:35.889
'cause I didn't see any
in the fridge

24:35.891 --> 24:38.141
and I figured you had a woozy
of a day at the‐‐

24:38.143 --> 24:41.063
at the bank or,
well, wherever you‐‐

24:41.063 --> 24:42.693
I don't know where you were.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.820
‐ I had a long day.
‐ Yeah, well...

24:45.818 --> 24:47.568
‐ But let me‐‐
‐ Oh, no, come on, please.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.109
Let me do this.
You sit right here.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.414
‐ Oh, okay.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.789
Thank you.
‐ All right.

25:01.792 --> 25:06.302
I added a few more
interesting spices here.

25:06.296 --> 25:09.126
‐ Ah, that's‐‐that's enough.
‐ Ah, it's never enough.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.593
There you go.
‐ Thank you, thank you.

25:26.817 --> 25:30.277
Shuji, can you pause the game?

25:31.613 --> 25:33.953
‐ Yeah.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.329
‐ Look.

25:35.325 --> 25:38.945
This reminded me of you.

25:40.622 --> 25:45.422
I love you.
You're my number‐one son.

25:45.419 --> 25:50.009
‐ I'm your only son, Mom.
‐ I know, but...

25:53.427 --> 25:57.807
Anyone would be so lucky
to have you.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.176
‐ Okay, okay, thanks, Mom.
I love you, too.

26:00.184 --> 26:02.274
‐ Okay, okay.
‐ Yes.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.649
Thank you
for the dope painting.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.855
‐ All right.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.726
‐ I like it.
‐ Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?

26:08.734 --> 26:10.654
‐ Mm‐hmm.

26:10.652 --> 26:13.532
‐ Mm.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.410
Okay. Back to game.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.669
‐  Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy

26:31.673 --> 26:34.303
Silly, silly, silly, silly

26:36.970 --> 26:39.930
‐ Oh, my funny girl.
Go to sleep.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.102
‐ I don't want to.
‐ I love you.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.482
‐ Do you love me
more than Shuji?

26:45.479 --> 26:47.229
‐ Mm, equal.

26:47.231 --> 26:50.281
But you are
my number‐one daughter,

26:50.275 --> 26:53.195
and I'm so glad
you're my daughter.

26:53.195 --> 26:56.695
‐ That doesn't count.
‐ Yes, it does.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.238
It's important.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.995
‐ Okay, then can I have
a present like Shuji got one?

27:02.996 --> 27:06.286
‐ Okay, when you turn 18,

27:06.291 --> 27:10.501
I'll give you a present
that I got from Stevie Wonder.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.304
‐ Who's that?

27:12.297 --> 27:13.757
‐ Oh, you don't know?

27:13.757 --> 27:15.127
‐ No.
‐ It's okay.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.354
Now go to sleep, okay?
‐ I'm not tired.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.305
‐ Yes, you are.
I'll sing you a song.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.635
‐  Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy

27:21.640 --> 27:22.770
‐ No, uh, stop.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.346
‐  Daddy, Daddy,
Daddy, Daddy

27:24.351 --> 27:26.401
Chili, chili, chili, chili,
go to sleep, go to sleep

27:26.395 --> 27:29.015
Everybody sleep, sleep,
everybody sleep, sleep

27:29.022 --> 27:31.692
‐ Okay, okay, enough, enough.
‐ I don't want to.

27:31.692 --> 27:34.242
‐ Go to sleep.
‐ I don't want to go to bed.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.696
Okay.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.388
Fred?

28:01.221 --> 28:03.641
Fred?
‐ Mm, mm‐hmm?

28:05.517 --> 28:07.187
‐ Listen.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.814
Are you all right?

28:10.814 --> 28:14.944
‐ I want to tell you a story
that I never told you before.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.823
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Many years ago

28:17.821 --> 28:22.201
I was working on a film called
"Seven Nights in Japan."

28:22.200 --> 28:26.460
It was a British/Japanese
co‐production.

28:26.455 --> 28:31.335
And we were all staying
in a small remote village.

28:31.335 --> 28:34.875
And I was the only one
who spoke the two languages.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.260
And the very first morning,

28:38.258 --> 28:42.758
I brought the British crew
to the Japanese dining room.

28:42.763 --> 28:46.353
The whole Japanese crew
were eating breakfast,

28:46.350 --> 28:48.600
and they're all cracking
raw egg

28:48.602 --> 28:50.692
and putting it over rice.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.267
The British crew,
they all went like,

28:53.273 --> 28:56.323
"Ew, we're not gonna
eat that."

28:56.318 --> 28:59.148
So they asked me
for milk and sugar.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.574
So this time
the Brits pour sugar

29:02.574 --> 29:04.914
and milk over hot rice.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.580
And when they were
eating this,

29:06.578 --> 29:09.078
the Japanese crew
all went, "Ew."

29:09.081 --> 29:12.671
And I was always in the middle
of the two cultures,

29:12.668 --> 29:14.418
stuck there.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.209
And I feel
like I've been like that

29:17.214 --> 29:19.384
with you and with my family.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.223
Sometimes I never know
what's right by you

29:22.219 --> 29:24.429
and what's right by the kids.

29:24.429 --> 29:27.059
I'm being too Japanese

29:27.057 --> 29:30.227
or trying to be too American.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.147
I feel like I'm always stuck

29:32.145 --> 29:34.685
in the middle
of the two cultures.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.284
‐ You...

29:41.279 --> 29:43.869
you never talk about this.

29:46.076 --> 29:49.496
‐ But I'm happy right now.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.286
I'm happy with this life.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.010
‐ You were gone
a long time today.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.468
I missed you.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.684
‐ I missed you, too.
