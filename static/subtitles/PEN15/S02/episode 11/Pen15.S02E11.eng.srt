1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,330
‐ Oh, God.

2
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,947
You can't put that there.

3
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,464
‐ Oh, where can I put it, then?

4
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,825
I've got waiters
coming in and out.

5
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,171
Just somewhere not in the way.

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,140
One, two, a‐one, two, one, two.

7
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:37,474
I, I am hiding

8
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:44,102
The you I show to you
is just a lie

9
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,194
You take what you want,
you get what you take

10
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,570
Lie 
‐  High, high, high

11
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,409
‐ Maya!
Are you ready?

12
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,905
Come on, let's go!

13
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,276
‐ Wait, Mom,
you're making onigiri?

14
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,043
‐ Yeah.
‐ No, I want a turkey sandwich.

15
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,405
‐ Oh, go get dressed.

16
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,621
Go get dressed.
You'll catch cold.

17
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,080
‐ Okay, but can you make
a turkey sandwich?

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,830
‐ I will.

19
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,172
Mom!

20
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,957
Can you help me find
my HitClip?

21
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,591
I can't find it!
Mom, come on!

22
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,048
Ah.

23
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,929
Okay!
Coming.

24
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,425
I last saw it
in the living room.

25
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,809
I have it!

26
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,805
- Give it back!
-  I have it

27
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,266
I love this song

28
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,136
‐ Maya, give it back!
‐  Za‐la‐la‐la‐la‐‐

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,813
‐ Stop! Shuji!
‐ Shuji, stop!

30
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,901
‐ Just 'cause we're
half‐siblings doesn't mean

31
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,186
you get to keep half my stuff!

32
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,819
‐ Don't say that!
We're brother‐sister, you‐‐

33
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,185
‐ Shuji, stop it!
‐ No, we're not, you idiot.

34
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,532
Half, half.
‐ Ow!

35
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,106
Mom, just tell him to stop!
‐ Just‐‐just stop.

36
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,912
Give him that "Shit Grip" back.

37
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,736
Huh?

38
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,661
‐ Did you just call it "shit"?

39
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,290
Mom, that's not
what it's called.

40
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,496
It's called a HitClip.

41
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,497
Say it again, say it again.

42
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,538
‐ HitGrip.
‐ No!

43
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,381
HitClip!
‐ HitGrip!

44
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,877
‐ Say "Oreo McFlurry."

45
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,048
‐ Oh, Maya, no.
‐ Say it!

46
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,916
‐ Come on, do it.
You got it.

47
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,593
‐ Oleo MacFurry.

48
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,546
Enough!
Okay, go get ready‐‐

49
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,012
Go!

50
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,762
Shuji!

51
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,524
- Go get dressed.
- You bitch!

52
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,806
- Breakfast ready.
- Come on.

53
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,606
‐ Yuki!
‐ Yes, Fred?

54
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,147
You think I need
to wear a coat today?

55
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,861
‐ I don't know.
It's in the 60s.

56
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,782
So not a cardigan.

57
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,081
You think I need
to wear a coat?

58
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,695
‐ Cardigan or coat,
whatever you like.

59
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,293
Come on, everybody,
breakfast is ready!

60
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,039
Hurry up!

61
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,633
Oh, honey,
this looks beautiful.

62
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,589
Ugh, I am so hungry.
This is great.

63
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,221
Uh‐‐oh, hey,
do we have any hot sauce?

64
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,469
Yeah.

65
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,102
Ugh, I'm sorry, it's gone.

66
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,059
So I'll get it this afternoon.

67
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,901
‐ Shut up.
‐ Get off of me.

68
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,316
‐ Stop.
Just give it to me.

69
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,775
‐ No.

70
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,065
Get away, you annoying freak.
‐ Mom!

71
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,610
‐ Maya, enough.
Shut up.

72
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,414
‐ Oh, my God, Mom, you just
told your daughter to shut up.

73
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,659
What's wrong with you?
‐ Maya, stop it.

74
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,332
‐ That's crazy.

75
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,581
What a big bite.

76
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,504
Ay, ay, ay, ay, yah.

77
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,302
Oh, it's‐‐that's Kathy.

78
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,006
‐ I didn't even eat.
‐ You were late, so come on.

79
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,257
‐ I got to go, too.

80
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,088
‐ Don't forget to bring‐‐
take everything.

81
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,513
I'm seeing Frank and his trio.

82
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,483
Oh, honey,
can you call Richard?

83
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,725
He's gonna ask
about the tour dates.

84
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,057
Can you just give him a call?
‐ Okay.

85
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,061
‐ Thank you.
‐ Bye.

86
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,612
‐ All right.

87
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,686
‐ Oh!

88
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,491
Maya, Shuji!
Your lunches!

89
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,776
‐ Bye.

90
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,697
Bitch.

91
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,185
‐ No parking
if you're not handicapped.

92
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,321
‐ Bitch.
‐ You don't have a sign.

93
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,899
‐ Bitch, bitch.

94
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,382
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,824
Mm‐hmm.

96
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,810
‐ No.

97
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,850
Mm.

98
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,480
Yuki...

99
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,116
‐ Mm.

100
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,485
‐ Oh, I‐‐
I got to go.

101
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,758
Ah.

102
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,181
Hello, Doctor?

103
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,770
Yeah, this is Yuki.

104
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,766
I can't make it today, uh,
can I reschedule, please?

105
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,821
Oh, okay.
Good‐‐goodbye, Doctor.

106
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,450
‐ Mm.
Ah...

107
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,028
‐ Ah, mm.

108
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,486
‐ Ah.

109
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,080
Eh?

110
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,459
‐ Ah.

111
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,554
‐ Okay.

112
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,411
Mm.

113
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,109
‐ Mm.

114
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,299
‐ You knowing English and
working as an interpreter

115
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,337
inspired me to learn English.

116
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,051
It's what helped me
get this job.

117
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,261
‐ Wow, that's very good.

118
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,262
Yeah.

119
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,723
‐ Arigato.
‐ Ooh‐‐

120
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,433
‐ Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

121
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,893
It's okay.

122
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,234
It's okay.
It's only my boobs.

123
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,480
Your boobs?

124
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,696
‐ Stevie Wonder?

125
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,572
No.
‐ Yes.

126
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,439
Ah!

127
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,899
‐ Eh?

128
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,775
Ah.

129
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,267
If you see me walkin'
down the street

130
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:36,362
And I start to cry
each time we meet

131
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,160
Walk on by

132
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,827
Walk on by

133
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:49,077
Make believe that you don't
see the tears

134
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,961
Just let me grieve
in private

135
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,670
'Cause each time I see you

136
00:20:55,671 --> 00:21:00,261
I break down and cry

137
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,799
Walk on by

138
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,263
Don't stop

139
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,734
Walk on by

140
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,185
Don't stop

141
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:16,776
Walk on by

142
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,106
I just can't
get over losin' you

143
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:25,122
And so if I seem
broken and blue

144
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,957
Walk on by

145
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,535
Walk on by

146
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,672
Foolish pride,
that's all that I have left

147
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,381
So let me hide

148
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,222
The tears and the sadness
you gave me

149
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,560
When you said goodbye...

150
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,514
‐ Hey. I didn't know when you
were gonna come home,

151
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,796
so I made
my world‐famous daddy chili.

152
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,800
‐ Were the kids okay?
‐ Yes, yeah, they loved it.

153
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,553
They're in their rooms.
They're fine.

154
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,144
Oh, and I got
some more hot sauce

155
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,889
'cause I didn't see any
in the fridge

156
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,141
and I figured you had a woozy
of a day at the‐‐

157
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,063
at the bank or,
well, wherever you‐‐

158
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,693
I don't know where you were.

159
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,820
‐ I had a long day.
‐ Yeah, well...

160
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,568
‐ But let me‐‐
‐ Oh, no, come on, please.

161
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,109
Let me do this.
You sit right here.

162
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,414
‐ Oh, okay.

163
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,789
Thank you.
‐ All right.

164
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:06,302
I added a few more
interesting spices here.

165
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,126
‐ Ah, that's‐‐that's enough.
‐ Ah, it's never enough.

166
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,593
There you go.
‐ Thank you, thank you.

167
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,277
Shuji, can you pause the game?

168
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,953
‐ Yeah.

169
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,329
‐ Look.

170
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,945
This reminded me of you.

171
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:45,422
I love you.
You're my number‐one son.

172
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,009
‐ I'm your only son, Mom.
‐ I know, but...

173
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:57,807
Anyone would be so lucky
to have you.

174
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,176
‐ Okay, okay, thanks, Mom.
I love you, too.

175
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,274
‐ Okay, okay.
‐ Yes.

176
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,649
Thank you
for the dope painting.

177
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,855
‐ All right.

178
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,726
‐ I like it.
‐ Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?

179
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,654
‐ Mm‐hmm.

180
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,532
‐ Mm.

181
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,410
Okay. Back to game.

182
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,669
‐  Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy

183
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,303
Silly, silly, silly, silly

184
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,930
‐ Oh, my funny girl.
Go to sleep.

185
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,102
‐ I don't want to.
‐ I love you.

186
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,482
‐ Do you love me
more than Shuji?

187
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,229
‐ Mm, equal.

188
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:50,281
But you are
my number‐one daughter,

189
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,195
and I'm so glad
you're my daughter.

190
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,695
‐ That doesn't count.
‐ Yes, it does.

191
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,238
It's important.

192
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,995
‐ Okay, then can I have
a present like Shuji got one?

193
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,286
‐ Okay, when you turn 18,

194
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,501
I'll give you a present
that I got from Stevie Wonder.

195
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,304
‐ Who's that?

196
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,757
‐ Oh, you don't know?

197
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,127
‐ No.
‐ It's okay.

198
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,354
Now go to sleep, okay?
‐ I'm not tired.

199
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,305
‐ Yes, you are.
I'll sing you a song.

200
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,635
‐  Mommy, Mommy,
Mommy, Mommy

201
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,770
‐ No, uh, stop.

202
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,346
‐  Daddy, Daddy,
Daddy, Daddy

203
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,401
Chili, chili, chili, chili,
go to sleep, go to sleep

204
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,015
Everybody sleep, sleep,
everybody sleep, sleep

205
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,692
‐ Okay, okay, enough, enough.
‐ I don't want to.

206
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,242
‐ Go to sleep.
‐ I don't want to go to bed.

207
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,696
Okay.

208
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,388
Fred?

209
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,641
Fred?
‐ Mm, mm‐hmm?

210
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,187
‐ Listen.

211
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,814
Are you all right?

212
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,944
‐ I want to tell you a story
that I never told you before.

213
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,823
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Many years ago

214
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:22,201
I was working on a film called
"Seven Nights in Japan."

215
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,460
It was a British/Japanese
co‐production.

216
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:31,335
And we were all staying
in a small remote village.

217
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,875
And I was the only one
who spoke the two languages.

218
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,260
And the very first morning,

219
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:42,758
I brought the British crew
to the Japanese dining room.

220
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:46,353
The whole Japanese crew
were eating breakfast,

221
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,600
and they're all cracking
raw egg

222
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,692
and putting it over rice.

223
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,267
The British crew,
they all went like,

224
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,323
"Ew, we're not gonna
eat that."

225
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,148
So they asked me
for milk and sugar.

226
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,574
So this time
the Brits pour sugar

227
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,914
and milk over hot rice.

228
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,580
And when they were
eating this,

229
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,078
the Japanese crew
all went, "Ew."

230
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,671
And I was always in the middle
of the two cultures,

231
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,418
stuck there.

232
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,209
And I feel
like I've been like that

233
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,384
with you and with my family.

234
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:22,223
Sometimes I never know
what's right by you

235
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,429
and what's right by the kids.

236
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,059
I'm being too Japanese

237
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:30,227
or trying to be too American.

238
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,147
I feel like I'm always stuck

239
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,685
in the middle
of the two cultures.

240
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,284
‐ You...

241
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,869
you never talk about this.

242
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,496
‐ But I'm happy right now.

243
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,286
I'm happy with this life.

244
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,010
‐ You were gone
a long time today.

245
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,468
I missed you.

246
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,684
‐ I missed you, too.
