of time together.</i>

00:14.738 --> 00:17.368
<i>It's just been moments here and there.</i>

00:31.981 --> 00:33.571
<i>You know, if I'm alone with him,</i>

00:33.568 --> 00:34.898
<i>I can tell him I'm not a slut,</i>

00:34.903 --> 00:36.243
<i>and I'm sorry that
people know about us.</i>

00:36.239 --> 00:38.079
<i>I just gotta get him alone.</i>

00:51.812 --> 00:53.772
<i>I mean, obviously, he has trouble</i>

00:53.774 --> 00:55.824
<i>expressing his emotions,
so if I'm alone with him,</i>

00:55.820 --> 00:57.620
<i>he can really open up.</i>

00:57.615 --> 01:00.285
<i>He doesn't like people
knowing his business.</i>

01:23.959 --> 01:28.889
‐ buh, buh, buh, buh,
buh, buh, buh, buh...

01:28.886 --> 01:31.426
<i>♪ Buh buh buh bubby dub dub dub dubby ♪</i>

<i>♪ buh buh buh bubby dub dub dub dubby ♪</i>

02:11.972 --> 02:13.852
<i>If I was around, he'd notice me,</i>

02:13.851 --> 02:15.731
<i>and I think the next stop
would be getting him</i>

02:15.730 --> 02:17.190
<i>to ask me to be his girlfriend,</i>

02:17.191 --> 02:18.991
<i>and then I get my first kiss.</i>

02:39.401 --> 02:41.031
<i>And if I got my first kiss,</i>

02:41.030 --> 02:42.700
<i>then he probably would ask me out.</i>

02:42.700 --> 02:44.660
<i>I'd be his gf. Ha ha.</i>

02:44.663 --> 02:48.673
<i>Oh, my god. Maybe we'd
go to the same college.</i>

02:48.671 --> 02:51.761
<i>- We just need time alone.</i>
- Hey, tj, come out.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.350
<i>But what if he forgets about me?</i>

02:53.346 --> 02:56.476
'Cause we haven't spent
a lot of time together.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.277
It's just been moments here and there.

02:59.275 --> 03:00.645
Mai.

03:00.653 --> 03:02.073
‐ oh.

03:02.072 --> 03:03.412
Hey.

03:05.621 --> 03:07.791
Na...

03:07.792 --> 03:10.012
I think I wanna join wrestling.

03:16.475 --> 03:17.475
What?

03:17.477 --> 03:18.807
‐ what?

03:37.810 --> 03:38.980
‐ why do you keep looking over there?

03:38.979 --> 03:40.569
‐ I'm not.

03:42.069 --> 03:44.739
‐ you just‐‐why‐‐you only wanna join
wrestling 'cause Brandt's here.

03:44.741 --> 03:47.081
‐ no, I‐‐stop saying his name so loud.

03:47.079 --> 03:48.619
He's literally right there.

03:48.624 --> 03:50.044
‐ I just said it‐‐like, not at all.

03:50.043 --> 03:51.513
‐ I‐‐okay. Listen to me.

03:51.505 --> 03:54.215
I didn't even know Brandt was in there.

03:54.218 --> 03:55.598
‐ okay. ‐ I promise.

03:55.596 --> 03:56.716
‐ okay.

03:56.723 --> 03:58.313
You were staring right at him, but...

03:58.309 --> 04:00.769
‐ yeah, 'cause I'm surprised
that I found him there.

04:00.773 --> 04:03.443
I mean, like, honestly, I have
always wanted to wrestle.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.834
‐ mai... ‐ what?

04:05.825 --> 04:09.035
‐ girls wrote "desperate
slut" in my chorus folder.

04:12.337 --> 04:13.797
‐ listen to me.

04:13.799 --> 04:16.099
I hate girls right now, okay?

04:16.095 --> 04:18.975
I'm over them.

04:18.976 --> 04:21.896
I just like guys, you know?

04:21.898 --> 04:24.488
'Cause guys don't gossip,

04:24.486 --> 04:27.366
they don't talk about stuff
like that, they're not mean.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.667
I just‐‐I just feel
like if we go in there,

04:30.666 --> 04:32.496
we can just try it out.

04:32.503 --> 04:35.893
And if you hate it, then we
don't ever have to go back.

04:35.885 --> 04:37.925
Okay?

04:37.930 --> 04:40.940
Just you, me...

04:40.936 --> 04:43.396
And ten guys.

04:43.399 --> 04:45.239
That's it.

04:45.236 --> 04:47.446
‐ no.

04:47.449 --> 04:49.909
No, mai. No.

04:49.913 --> 04:51.373
‐ fine! Fine.

04:51.373 --> 04:53.293
But I have an inner voice inside of me

04:53.294 --> 04:54.844
that sounds a lot like my voice,

04:54.839 --> 04:56.469
and it's telling me to
go in there and wrestle.

04:56.467 --> 04:58.717
And I‐‐I can't ignore
it, so I have to go,

04:58.722 --> 05:00.182
and I'd like you to join

05:00.183 --> 05:01.983
or at least watch and be a good friend.

05:01.978 --> 05:03.308
<i>Stay low, Sam.</i>

05:07.322 --> 05:08.622
Lock your hands.

05:10.078 --> 05:11.958
Slam him!

05:11.957 --> 05:13.997
Hey, m‐‐mr. Brown.

05:14.002 --> 05:16.512
I'd like to join wrestling, please.

05:16.508 --> 05:18.388
Mm‐hmm.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.726
Like, join the wrestling
team and stuff.

05:21.726 --> 05:23.346
Your calves get any bigger,

05:23.354 --> 05:24.734
you're gonna fall through the floor.

05:24.732 --> 05:25.902
Thanks, coach.

05:25.901 --> 05:27.781
‐ that's not something we do here.

05:27.780 --> 05:29.780
Why, 'cause I'm a girl?

05:29.784 --> 05:33.254
And I'm, like, stronger than
everyone here, probably.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.629
Uh, yeah. You could get seriously hurt.

05:35.629 --> 05:39.339
‐ well, um, I think it'd be
kind of messed up and illegal

05:39.344 --> 05:41.144
if you didn't let me. ‐ levels, levels.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.140
‐ and I could probably report it.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.812
‐ okay. Fine.

05:43.812 --> 05:45.482
You can shadow.

05:45.481 --> 05:46.941
Go stand over there and watch.

05:46.943 --> 05:49.283
‐ okay. Thanks, coach.

05:51.243 --> 05:54.833
When you come in here, I
want you ready to wrestle.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.554
‐ coach is making me shadow.

05:57.548 --> 05:59.468
‐ dude, switch with me. ‐ sure.

06:04.812 --> 06:06.572
‐ whenever Brandt touches his balls,

06:06.566 --> 06:08.106
it means he wants a hand job.

06:08.110 --> 06:09.490
‐ bro, shut up.

06:09.488 --> 06:11.368
- Focus, focus, focus.
- Shut up.

06:11.367 --> 06:12.947
So stupid.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.879
‐ reach in and grab
all your rage inside

06:16.878 --> 06:18.298
and let it out.

06:18.297 --> 06:19.967
This is the place to do it,

06:19.968 --> 06:23.308
not on your mom, not on your date.

06:23.307 --> 06:25.517
Handle it like a man.

06:25.521 --> 06:28.651
Destroy something privately,
or, better yet, on a team.

06:38.672 --> 06:40.172
Nice!

06:45.561 --> 06:47.231
Mr. - drive it! Drive it!

06:47.230 --> 06:49.110
Drive it! Drive it! Drive it!

06:49.109 --> 06:51.109
Nice, zablowski.

06:51.113 --> 06:53.743
- Good job.
- ‐

06:53.744 --> 06:56.794
‐ that was dope. ‐ thanks.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.511
Sam cock‐block‐‐ so annoying.

06:59.505 --> 07:02.005
Mr. brown, I'm, like, ready to wrestle.

07:02.010 --> 07:03.890
I've learned a lot from shadowing.

07:03.889 --> 07:06.769
‐ fine. Tj, partner up with Maya.

07:06.770 --> 07:08.570
She says she's ready to wrestle.

07:08.565 --> 07:11.445
‐ coach, I don't want to.

07:11.445 --> 07:13.865
‐ come on, let's go.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.867
‐ okay.

07:21.883 --> 07:24.143
Now? Okay.

07:24.137 --> 07:26.347
Stupid.

07:33.907 --> 07:35.867
I wasn't ready. Like, what the hell?

07:35.869 --> 07:37.249
Coach, can we stop?

07:37.247 --> 07:39.207
I feel weird.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.379
‐ fine, if he doesn't wanna wrestle,

07:40.378 --> 07:42.718
I'll wrestle anybody else, honestly.

07:42.716 --> 07:44.796
Anybody. Just raise your hand.

07:44.804 --> 07:46.434
Like, I'm ready to frickin' go.

07:48.269 --> 07:50.769
Brandt, whatever‐‐ if you want to.

07:56.619 --> 07:57.709
<i>Making her way to the ring,</i>

07:57.705 --> 08:00.625
<i>Trish stratus!</i>

08:00.627 --> 08:03.217
‐ why don't you just,
like, talk to him, then?

08:03.215 --> 08:04.585
‐ 'cause I don't wanna be like,

08:04.594 --> 08:06.264
"hey, I'm terra newback.

08:06.263 --> 08:07.733
"Let me just talk to
you for a long time

08:07.725 --> 08:08.975
while you're bored as hell, Brandt."

08:08.977 --> 08:11.687
Like... I'm not freakin' desperate.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.911
I just want him to know I'm
hanging around and stuff.

08:14.906 --> 08:17.746
‐ Maya, I don't wanna hear
about Brandt anymore.

08:17.745 --> 08:19.865
‐ okay, well, that's fine
'cause I'm not talking to you.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.214
I'm talking to Andy. ‐ who's that?

08:22.212 --> 08:23.632
You serious?

08:23.632 --> 08:26.092
You've never heard of Trish stratus?

08:26.094 --> 08:27.564
‐ Trish stratus.

08:27.556 --> 08:29.136
‐ her muscles are gross.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.022
‐ yeah. No, she's slutty.

08:31.021 --> 08:32.781
‐ yeah. ‐ yo, Trish is hot.

08:32.775 --> 08:34.775
She's got my mad respect.

08:36.073 --> 08:38.623
‐ hmm. Okay.

08:40.122 --> 08:43.092
Oh, shit! ‐ okay, I can do that...
Easily.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.467
‐ no, you can't, dummy. ‐ yes, I can!

08:45.466 --> 08:47.466
Are you frickin' serious? Look at me.

08:47.470 --> 08:52.110
‐ Maya, no offense but, like,
this b could take you.

08:52.105 --> 08:53.315
‐ Doubt that.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.315
‐ okay, that's what tj mulligan thought

08:55.319 --> 08:56.529
before I freakin' kicked his ass.

08:56.531 --> 08:57.951
- Did you see that?
- Oh, really?

08:57.950 --> 08:59.240
Oh, what way am I gonna go, bitch?

08:59.244 --> 09:01.294
Or, what, bitch? Come at me, bitch.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.590
‐ your dad can't eat anything.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.125
‐ guys, move. You're blocking the TV.

09:04.129 --> 09:06.049
- ‐ he wants to destroy your ass.
- Oh, yeah?

09:06.049 --> 09:07.599
Your dad eats soggy potatoes.

09:07.595 --> 09:09.425
‐ and it makes him fart
on your face, Anna!

09:09.431 --> 09:10.931
You're going down.

09:10.934 --> 09:12.154
Put your money where your mouth is.

09:12.145 --> 09:14.145
I'm putting my butt on your face.

09:14.149 --> 09:16.189
You're cheating. You cannot do that.

09:16.194 --> 09:17.574
‐ hey, yo, go, get her, Maya.

09:17.573 --> 09:19.833
- Stop it.
- You're gonna die,

09:19.827 --> 09:21.867
and I'm gonna be alive.

09:21.873 --> 09:24.133
You're so frickin' weak, Maya.

09:24.127 --> 09:26.507
No! Who's weak now, bitch?

09:26.507 --> 09:28.007
I won.

09:32.686 --> 09:36.436
Mom. The anna‐sthetizer
wants to put you to sleep.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.493
Aah!

09:37.487 --> 09:39.027
Oh, sorry.

09:39.032 --> 09:41.332
But I just‐‐it's like that,
we were just wrestling,

09:41.328 --> 09:43.538
and it was like, "I'm
the anna‐ihilator."

09:43.541 --> 09:45.841
Anna.

09:45.837 --> 09:48.377
I have a migraine from
doing energy work all day.

09:48.384 --> 09:49.974
‐ well, I've been wrestling all day.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.430
Like, don't make me flip you.

09:52.433 --> 09:54.653
‐ could you take that
gross pillow to your dad?

09:54.647 --> 09:56.227
He left it on my side of the house.

09:56.233 --> 09:58.453
‐ yeah, that's fine, just
bring it to his room.

09:58.445 --> 10:00.405
And quietly, please. ‐ okay.

10:00.408 --> 10:01.988
‐ I can't take it.

10:05.376 --> 10:07.506
Dad? ‐

10:10.052 --> 10:12.392
dad? Mm‐hmm.

10:12.390 --> 10:15.730
‐ um, do we have channel 151?

10:15.731 --> 10:18.071
'Cause I want my <i>Monday nights raw.</i>

10:18.068 --> 10:19.198
- ‐ what?
<i>- Raw.</i>

10:19.195 --> 10:21.065
I want my <i>Monday nights raw.</i>

10:21.074 --> 10:24.624
I‐‐I‐‐I think we get,
like, to channel one...

10:24.623 --> 10:26.963
Hey, what's that pillow doing in here?

10:26.961 --> 10:29.261
‐ mom just said to bring it to you

10:29.257 --> 10:30.967
because you left it on
her side of the house.

10:30.969 --> 10:34.389
‐ I told her already; She
can take it to the dump.

10:34.392 --> 10:35.942
But you know your mother.

10:35.937 --> 10:38.477
I mean, she does whatever she
wants, whenever she wants.

10:38.484 --> 10:42.494
Don't leave the pillow.
I don't want it.

10:44.663 --> 10:45.673
‐ okay.

10:45.665 --> 10:47.995
I just never pictured

10:48.003 --> 10:52.263
your mom and I's marriage going
quite this way, you know.

10:52.261 --> 10:54.181
I've never been more in
love with anybody but her

10:54.182 --> 10:55.642
my whole life.

10:55.644 --> 10:57.024
‐ oh, yeah?

10:57.021 --> 10:58.821
Yet you can still end up

10:58.817 --> 11:00.607
sort of hating people anyway.

11:02.406 --> 11:05.196
You know, if I'm the one that
ends up having to move out‐‐

11:05.204 --> 11:08.004
even if I can only
afford an apartment‐‐

11:08.001 --> 11:09.921
I'm not gonna resent it.

11:12.051 --> 11:14.141
I just want you and
your mom to be happy.

11:17.103 --> 11:19.323
<i>Life can pummel you down, sweetie.</i>

11:21.361 --> 11:24.241
<i>I hope you learn how to pummel back.</i>

11:24.242 --> 11:28.462
‐ take me now. The anna‐ihilator!

11:37.435 --> 11:39.685
Get up... Get up!

11:41.401 --> 11:43.361
Ooh! Ah!

11:43.363 --> 11:45.123
You want some of this?

11:46.244 --> 11:47.584
'Sup?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.842
You're hot and strong.

11:50.837 --> 11:53.757
You got my mad respect.

12:09.875 --> 12:11.125
So my mom took me to kinko's...

12:11.127 --> 12:12.587
Latest installment of <i>weasels.</i>

12:12.589 --> 12:14.429
Which one do you think is better?

12:14.425 --> 12:16.595
I think glossy really
makes it pop, you know?

12:16.597 --> 12:18.097
‐ cool.

12:20.437 --> 12:22.017
‐ hello? Hey, dude.

12:22.024 --> 12:23.994
I was up until, like, 10:00 doing this.

12:23.987 --> 12:26.527
Glossy or matte? ‐ no, either's great.

12:26.534 --> 12:28.834
Okay? Yo, hey.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.580
Ha.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.713
What's up, zablowski?

12:31.711 --> 12:33.211
Hey.

12:33.213 --> 12:35.723
I'll see you later.
Yo, Brandt, wait up!

12:40.729 --> 12:41.899
‐ glossy it is, then.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.083
Mr. brown.

12:51.082 --> 12:52.792
‐ Mr. brown.

12:52.794 --> 12:54.264
‐ I just thought practice yesterday

12:54.255 --> 12:55.625
was really inspiring. ‐ yeah.

12:55.633 --> 12:57.183
‐ your team is well‐oiled,

12:57.178 --> 12:59.768
and I was just honing in my skills

12:59.767 --> 13:01.437
just about all night last night.

13:01.436 --> 13:04.646
And... Do you wanna see them?
You don't have to.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.991
But I'll just show you.

13:06.989 --> 13:09.039
‐ Anna! ‐ and then you take it down

13:09.035 --> 13:10.615
to brown town. ‐ stop.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.633
‐ well, Maya, I guess you have someone

13:13.628 --> 13:16.008
to fart around with at
practice, so that's something.

13:16.007 --> 13:18.297
‐ well, um, I would love that,

13:18.303 --> 13:20.183
except I already wrestled her a bunch.

13:20.182 --> 13:22.482
I don't really feel like that's
challenging enough for me.

13:22.478 --> 13:24.398
I was just thinking I could maybe

13:24.398 --> 13:27.148
take on Brandt at the mock
meet on Friday or whatever.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.494
‐ well, I already beat her
a bunch of times. Well‐‐

13:29.492 --> 13:32.502
‐ Brandt's the... Best
wrestler in school.

13:32.498 --> 13:34.248
Plus, you're different weight classes.

13:34.252 --> 13:35.462
Oh, that's okay.

13:35.462 --> 13:37.342
Maya and I can just partner up.

13:37.341 --> 13:39.931
‐ Um...

13:39.930 --> 13:41.810
Just out of curiosity;

13:41.809 --> 13:44.019
how much weight do I have to gain

13:44.021 --> 13:46.071
to be in Brandt's class?

13:46.067 --> 13:48.987
‐ you'd have to gain at least
6 to 12 pounds in a week,

13:48.990 --> 13:51.080
which is unhealthy at your
age and could mess you up.

13:51.077 --> 13:54.287
So please don't try it.

13:55.837 --> 13:56.957
‐ we won't.

13:56.964 --> 13:58.974
We won't. ‐ we won't.

14:02.601 --> 14:04.861
You're doing it for me,

14:04.855 --> 14:06.525
but you're doing it for yourself too.

14:06.525 --> 14:10.025
‐ clear, Maya, go! Clear, Maya, go!

14:10.032 --> 14:11.582
Yeah, mai. You're bulking.

14:11.577 --> 14:14.457
And you can't stop.

14:14.457 --> 14:16.877
‐

14:36.084 --> 14:38.464
‐ this is what it takes.

14:41.094 --> 14:42.934
It's better with a little bit extra...

15:00.090 --> 15:02.090
- ‐ no, little bitch.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.690
‐ ha!

15:06.812 --> 15:07.982
- ‐ sick.

15:12.322 --> 15:15.752
You guys, I'm slamming
down the Mac and cheese.

15:15.747 --> 15:18.457
Student can I have a bite of yours?

15:18.460 --> 15:20.050
Um, here's the thing.

15:20.047 --> 15:23.297
If you put peanut butter on the
hard‐boiled egg, that's the trick.

15:23.303 --> 15:25.813
‐ what‐‐what trick?
How is that a trick?

15:25.808 --> 15:28.398
‐ that is a trick. You get "yolked."

15:28.396 --> 15:30.736
That's what, um, Trish stratus does.

15:30.735 --> 15:33.485
She's hot. ‐ yeah, she is hot.

15:33.490 --> 15:35.450
‐ and muscle weighs more than fat.

15:35.452 --> 15:36.962
‐ Muscle weighs more than fat.

15:36.955 --> 15:38.245
‐ that's what people don't realize.

15:38.249 --> 15:41.379
‐ anyway, bro. Coach
brown got that new mat.

15:41.380 --> 15:43.130
I'm gonna wrestle yo' ass.

15:43.134 --> 15:46.184
So if you're gaining pounds‐‐lbs‐‐

15:46.182 --> 15:48.232
that's not a bad thing.

15:48.228 --> 15:50.268
‐ anyway, I'm gonna go hit the gym.
That was so funny

15:50.273 --> 15:51.823
when you did that the other day.

15:51.819 --> 15:53.399
You gonna eat all your peaches?

15:56.745 --> 15:58.205
Oh, you don't say "bye" now?

15:58.206 --> 16:01.796
Oh, my god, the protein's
going to her fat‐ass head.

16:01.797 --> 16:03.677
I'm just kidding.

16:06.682 --> 16:09.692
Take a picture. It'll
last longer, you guys.

16:12.025 --> 16:13.945
Girls are so annoying, honestly.

16:13.946 --> 16:15.026
Hammer fist!

16:18.037 --> 16:19.747
Nailed him.

17:07.386 --> 17:09.386
It's like I'm stalking you.

17:11.143 --> 17:13.653
Just kidding.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.419
Are you mad at me?

17:27.844 --> 17:30.104
‐ why'd you join wrestling?

17:32.562 --> 17:34.612
‐ 'cause I love ww.

17:34.608 --> 17:36.358
‐

17:36.360 --> 17:38.570
‐ I have for years, seriously.

17:43.667 --> 17:46.547
I'm, like, sorry people
know about our three‐way.

17:46.548 --> 17:48.638
‐ yeah.

17:56.067 --> 17:58.357
‐ are you pissed?

17:59.532 --> 18:01.082
‐ yeah.

18:04.959 --> 18:08.759
‐ seriously, I'll do anything
I can to make it up to you.

18:11.973 --> 18:13.893
Anything.

18:15.940 --> 18:17.530
‐ yeah? Like what?

18:22.077 --> 18:23.787
What?

18:33.767 --> 18:36.017
If you take out the yolk of the egg...

18:36.021 --> 18:37.571
You fill it with peanut butter,

18:37.567 --> 18:39.527
it's truly like Reese's pieces.

18:39.529 --> 18:40.989
How can you say "no"?

18:40.990 --> 18:42.490
It tastes like my dog's ass.

18:42.492 --> 18:45.002
Anna! You can't tell the difference.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.378
I was gonna lift a tenner.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.745
Be back soon.

18:47.754 --> 18:49.884
Anna. Okay.

18:49.883 --> 18:52.643
<i>Come on, stop‐‐ Anna: I don't know why</i>

18:52.638 --> 18:54.138
- you keep doing this.
- Stop talking.

18:54.141 --> 18:55.441
You want me to get jacked or not?

18:55.435 --> 18:56.555
‐ literally, I was this close

18:56.563 --> 18:57.863
to getting my first kiss with Brandt.

18:57.857 --> 18:59.147
‐ how was I supposed to know that?

18:59.151 --> 19:00.321
I didn't know that.
That's amazing, though.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.700
Congratulations. ‐ no. Thank you.

19:01.698 --> 19:03.658
It's fine, it's great. But
it doesn't keep happening

19:03.660 --> 19:04.950
because you keep interrupting.

19:04.954 --> 19:06.374
You keep walking in on us. Like...

19:06.373 --> 19:08.343
‐ okay, well, I think that
you should learn to use

19:08.336 --> 19:09.956
a lock on a door if you don't
want people to walk in.

19:09.964 --> 19:11.934
‐ well, honestly, I don't
wanna creep him out.

19:11.927 --> 19:14.887
So I'm just closing the door,
and I'm not locking it,

19:14.891 --> 19:16.811
'cause I'm not crazy.

19:20.945 --> 19:22.485
I know it's not personal,

19:22.489 --> 19:24.659
but every time I'm alone
with him, you walk in.

19:24.661 --> 19:27.001
And, honestly, like, Brandt and I‐‐

19:26.998 --> 19:29.088
he doesn't really know
it yet, but, like,

19:29.086 --> 19:30.796
we want time alone together.

19:30.798 --> 19:32.258
'Cause if we don't have
time alone together,

19:32.259 --> 19:34.139
then we're not gonna be
able to get to the point

19:34.137 --> 19:35.677
- where I have my first kiss.
- Okay.

19:35.683 --> 19:37.903
It's just like, you're
like, "Brandt..."

19:37.895 --> 19:39.725
‐ shh.

19:39.732 --> 19:41.112
‐ no, you're always like, "Brandt..."

19:41.110 --> 19:43.620
‐ shh!

19:43.615 --> 19:44.945
‐ it's just like, you're
like, "Brandt, Brandt,

19:44.951 --> 19:46.371
"Brandt, Brandt, Brandt... ‐ stop.
Okay, okay, okay.

19:46.370 --> 19:47.500
- ‐ "Brandt, Brandt, Brandt."
- Stop!

19:47.497 --> 19:48.537
‐ and I'm like, "I
can't do it anymore."

19:48.542 --> 19:49.922
‐ stop! ‐ Brandt!

19:49.919 --> 19:51.839
- ‐ stop it, Anna!
- What?

19:51.840 --> 19:53.180
‐ you're saying his name so lou‐‐

19:53.175 --> 19:55.175
like, you're crazy, honestly.

19:59.313 --> 20:01.283
- ‐ is that your hair?
- No.

20:01.275 --> 20:03.355
- ‐ is that Brandt's locker?
- No.

20:03.362 --> 20:05.872
- ‐ Maya.
- Stop saying his name.

20:07.412 --> 20:10.792
‐ so, you and Maya in here, alone, huh?

20:10.794 --> 20:13.934
So that‐‐that was like...

20:13.926 --> 20:16.176
‐ she keeps following me around, man.

20:16.180 --> 20:18.270
‐ well, you hooked up with
both her and kone, right?

20:18.267 --> 20:19.727
Barely.

20:19.729 --> 20:22.569
I mean, I don't wanna get
near their big‐ass bushes.

20:22.568 --> 20:24.818
Their pussies smell like fish, dawg.

20:24.822 --> 20:27.292
I mean, these fingers are clean.

20:27.285 --> 20:29.075
Can't get that stank on me.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.343
‐ big, smelly bush.

20:33.339 --> 20:35.129
Oh, shit.

20:35.134 --> 20:38.354
Anna and Maya are bsbs‐‐
big, smelly bushes.

20:38.349 --> 20:39.349
Bro.

20:39.351 --> 20:41.111
‐ tuna‐kone.

20:44.027 --> 20:46.067
‐ yo, zablowski, you're funny, man.

20:52.545 --> 20:54.755
Flyweight.

20:54.757 --> 20:56.337
Middleweight. Middleweight.

20:56.343 --> 20:57.643
Middleweight.

21:02.439 --> 21:05.109
Jesus Christ, kone. Middleweight.

21:05.111 --> 21:06.491
What did you do?

21:08.117 --> 21:09.997
‐ Come on.

21:13.044 --> 21:16.514
‐ another middleweight. ‐ really?

21:16.509 --> 21:18.679
Does that mean I get to wrestle Brandt?

21:18.680 --> 21:21.480
‐ you made weight, but the
pairs are set already.

21:21.477 --> 21:22.977
First round is you versus blondie.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.690
Whoever wins gets to wrestle

21:24.692 --> 21:27.112
the winner of, uh, Brandt and Sam.

21:36.173 --> 21:39.183
Who do you think's gonna win?

21:39.179 --> 21:42.599
‐ I don't even know‐‐may‐‐
maybe‐‐maybe Sam.

21:42.603 --> 21:43.693
Drive it! ‐ maybe.

21:45.233 --> 21:47.323
Use your legs, Sam. Use your legs.

21:48.865 --> 21:49.865
Nice, zablowski.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.885
That was good.

22:00.889 --> 22:02.019
That was great.

22:10.324 --> 22:11.954
Get off.

22:16.629 --> 22:17.799
Stop! No.

22:17.798 --> 22:19.798
No.

22:21.848 --> 22:24.058
Let me win, Anna.

22:24.060 --> 22:25.940
No.

22:25.939 --> 22:27.989
‐ I need to get to Brandt. Stop.

22:27.985 --> 22:29.985
‐ no.

22:34.832 --> 22:36.752
Oh‐‐

22:36.753 --> 22:39.053
I got you. Lookit...

22:39.049 --> 22:42.059
You stay. You stay!

22:42.055 --> 22:43.425
She's out.

22:49.152 --> 22:52.202
‐ good match, bsb.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.463
‐ where's Brandt?

22:58.462 --> 23:00.222
‐ zablowski beat Brandt.

23:00.216 --> 23:02.426
‐ you ready for this, bowl cut?

23:03.472 --> 23:04.682
‐ don't call me that.

23:08.357 --> 23:10.397
Fold him like a ham sandwich.

23:12.783 --> 23:14.203
Is that all you got, bowl cut?

23:14.202 --> 23:15.452
Stop calling me that!

23:15.454 --> 23:16.464
I'm not calling you that.

23:16.456 --> 23:17.996
I'm calling you "bowl cut."

23:18.002 --> 23:19.462
Stop it!

23:19.462 --> 23:22.592
- Freakin' asshole!
- Language.

23:22.594 --> 23:24.974
Is that all you got?

23:24.974 --> 23:26.064
Get off.

23:26.059 --> 23:27.689
You're ruining everything right now.

23:27.688 --> 23:29.358
I shouldn't even be wrestling you.

23:29.357 --> 23:31.647
Well, at least I didn't
have a three‐way

23:31.654 --> 23:32.994
in the closet with Brandt.

23:32.990 --> 23:34.700
‐ yeah? You're just jealous

23:34.702 --> 23:36.752
no one would go to the
frickin' closet with you.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.050
Whoo‐whoo!

23:42.258 --> 23:43.758
Whatever, bsb.

23:43.762 --> 23:45.142
What?

23:45.139 --> 23:47.019
At least I don't have a big, hairy bush

23:47.018 --> 23:49.228
that smells like fish.

23:49.230 --> 23:50.230
What?

23:53.322 --> 23:55.872
‐ I didn't say that. Brandt
and the guys said that.

23:59.502 --> 24:01.842
Come on, fight, let's go.
It's‐‐it's not a big deal.

24:01.839 --> 24:03.179
It's just a‐‐it's just a joke.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.385
Come on, let's go. ‐ no, stop!

24:07.851 --> 24:09.771
‐ it's just a joke.

24:18.163 --> 24:20.383
Match?

24:37.410 --> 24:39.620
Here she is, star of the party.

24:39.623 --> 24:41.463
There's my little athlete. ‐ ow.

24:41.460 --> 24:44.420
‐ you win some, you lose some.
‐ ow, stop it.

24:44.424 --> 24:46.344
‐ oh, no. I'm so sorry.

24:46.344 --> 24:47.814
Did I hurt you? ‐ no.

24:47.806 --> 24:49.056
‐ mai, sorry.

24:49.058 --> 24:51.268
I just thought that's
what our buddies do.

24:51.271 --> 24:53.571
You ok‐‐you okay?

24:53.568 --> 24:55.948
‐ they're, um‐‐ ‐ what?

24:55.947 --> 25:00.917
‐ they're calling us "big,
smelly bush" ‐‐bsb.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.496
‐ wait. What?

25:02.503 --> 25:03.843
Us?

25:06.426 --> 25:08.056
Oh.

25:09.224 --> 25:10.774
Oh, like, what is‐‐what is that?

25:10.769 --> 25:13.269
Like‐‐ ‐ it's our pussies, na.

25:13.273 --> 25:15.783
Our pussies.

25:15.779 --> 25:17.989
That's what the guys
have been calling us.

25:17.991 --> 25:21.251
They've been saying that our vaginas
are hairy and smell like fish.

25:21.248 --> 25:23.668
‐ what? The guys?

25:23.670 --> 25:26.720
Yeah. ‐ no, but they're my friends.

25:26.717 --> 25:28.047
‐ yeah, well, they aren't anymore.

25:29.389 --> 25:32.349
‐ you can't trust anyone! Ow!

25:34.107 --> 25:37.197
‐ Anyone but you.

25:40.327 --> 25:41.997
Our pussies!

25:43.710 --> 25:45.250
It's okay.

25:48.051 --> 25:49.601
Weasel‐shark.

25:49.597 --> 25:53.097
Half‐weasel, half‐shark will
kill you and your family.

25:53.103 --> 25:55.193
‐ yo, zablowski.

25:55.190 --> 25:56.610
Yo, what up?

25:56.611 --> 25:58.031
Yo, Sam.

25:58.030 --> 26:00.580
What happened with
maya‐‐ you get a boner?

26:00.577 --> 26:01.827
I said "bsb" to her,

26:01.829 --> 26:03.629
and I probably shouldn't
have said that.

26:03.625 --> 26:04.915
Hey, Sam, you coming?

26:04.918 --> 26:06.838
Yeah, I'm coming. Hold up.

26:06.839 --> 26:08.589
Ooh, ooh! Oh!

26:10.555 --> 26:13.385
‐ wait. Did he just... Leave?

26:13.393 --> 26:15.863
I thought we were gonna hang out.

26:15.857 --> 26:17.527
‐ let's just go.

26:17.527 --> 26:19.527
Wrestling's kind of gay.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.963
<i>One, two, three.</i>

26:29.217 --> 26:31.757
Oh, my god. Are you looking?

26:33.266 --> 26:34.846
Yeah.

26:36.524 --> 26:38.284
I don't know. It's kind of weird.

26:40.322 --> 26:43.962
‐ I can't tell if it's,
like, big, but...

26:43.955 --> 26:45.745
<i>Can you smell anything?</i>

26:48.046 --> 26:50.676
‐ Yeah.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.467
Do you?

26:54.392 --> 26:57.982
‐ I think I smell something,
but it might not be that.

26:57.983 --> 27:01.363
I don't know. 'Cause my
mom's cooking, so...

27:02.951 --> 27:06.171
‐ I'm gonna try mixing
it with something.

27:06.166 --> 27:09.256
‐ okay, yeah. Maybe I have something.

27:16.144 --> 27:17.814
Ow!

27:17.814 --> 27:19.034
‐ are you okay, Maya?

27:19.025 --> 27:20.355
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

27:20.360 --> 27:22.320
<i>I think I burned it.</i>

27:22.323 --> 27:26.123
‐ be careful with it. Maybe
it doesn't like that.

27:26.122 --> 27:29.132
‐

27:37.061 --> 27:39.821
‐ I only have lip gloss.

27:39.816 --> 27:43.616
‐ it feels like a little... Animal.

27:46.204 --> 27:48.084
Hmm.

27:50.547 --> 27:54.097
Meow. Meow!

27:54.095 --> 27:55.885
Meow!

27:55.890 --> 27:58.520
I need a little catnip.

28:00.608 --> 28:03.658
Fly!

28:05.200 --> 28:06.950
Are you still there?

28:06.954 --> 28:09.714
- ‐ mm‐hmm.
<i>- I'm gonna go.</i>

28:09.710 --> 28:11.420
‐ love you, bye.

28:11.421 --> 28:12.801
<i>Bye.</i>

28:15.470 --> 28:17.140
‐

28:37.766 --> 28:41.356
<i>Meow! Meow!</i>

28:43.903 --> 28:45.783
<i>Fly!</i>
