00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:14,736
<i>We haven't spent a lot
of time together.</i>

2
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:17,368
<i>It's just been moments here and there.</i>

3
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:33,571
<i>You know, if I'm alone with him,</i>

4
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:34,898
<i>I can tell him I'm not a slut,</i>

5
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:36,243
<i>and I'm sorry that
people know about us.</i>

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,079
<i>I just gotta get him alone.</i>

7
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:53,772
<i>I mean, obviously, he has trouble</i>

8
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:55,824
<i>expressing his emotions,
so if I'm alone with him,</i>

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,620
<i>he can really open up.</i>

10
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:00,285
<i>He doesn't like people
knowing his business.</i>

11
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,889
‐ buh, buh, buh, buh,
buh, buh, buh, buh...

12
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:31,426
<i>♪ Buh buh buh bubby dub dub dub dubby ♪</i>

13
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:33,442
<i>♪ buh buh buh bubby dub dub dub dubby ♪</i>

14
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,852
<i>If I was around, he'd notice me,</i>

15
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,731
<i>and I think the next stop
would be getting him</i>

16
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,190
<i>to ask me to be his girlfriend,</i>

17
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:18,991
<i>and then I get my first kiss.</i>

18
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:41,031
<i>And if I got my first kiss,</i>

19
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,700
<i>then he probably would ask me out.</i>

20
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,660
<i>I'd be his gf. Ha ha.</i>

21
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:48,673
<i>Oh, my god. Maybe we'd
go to the same college.</i>

22
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:51,761
<i>- We just need time alone.</i>
- Hey, tj, come out.

23
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,350
<i>But what if he forgets about me?</i>

24
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:56,476
'Cause we haven't spent
a lot of time together.

25
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,277
It's just been moments here and there.

26
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,645
Mai.

27
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:02,073
‐ oh.

28
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:03,412
Hey.

29
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:07,791
Na...

30
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,012
I think I wanna join wrestling.

31
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:17,475
What?

32
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:18,807
‐ what?

33
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,980
‐ why do you keep looking over there?

34
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,569
‐ I'm not.

35
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,739
‐ you just‐‐why‐‐you only wanna join
wrestling 'cause Brandt's here.

36
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,081
‐ no, I‐‐stop saying his name so loud.

37
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,619
He's literally right there.

38
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,044
‐ I just said it‐‐like, not at all.

39
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,513
‐ I‐‐okay. Listen to me.

40
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:54,215
I didn't even know Brandt was in there.

41
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:55,598
‐ okay. ‐ I promise.

42
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:56,716
‐ okay.

43
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:58,313
You were staring right at him, but...

44
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:00,769
‐ yeah, 'cause I'm surprised
that I found him there.

45
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,443
I mean, like, honestly, I have
always wanted to wrestle.

46
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,834
‐ mai... ‐ what?

47
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:09,035
‐ girls wrote "desperate
slut" in my chorus folder.

48
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:13,797
‐ listen to me.

49
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,099
I hate girls right now, okay?

50
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:18,975
I'm over them.

51
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:21,896
I just like guys, you know?

52
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:24,488
'Cause guys don't gossip,

53
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:27,366
they don't talk about stuff
like that, they're not mean.

54
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,667
I just‐‐I just feel
like if we go in there,

55
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,496
we can just try it out.

56
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:35,893
And if you hate it, then we
don't ever have to go back.

57
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,925
Okay?

58
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,940
Just you, me...

59
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:43,396
And ten guys.

60
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,239
That's it.

61
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,446
‐ no.

62
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,909
No, mai. No.

63
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,373
‐ fine! Fine.

64
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,293
But I have an inner voice inside of me

65
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,844
that sounds a lot like my voice,

66
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,469
and it's telling me to
go in there and wrestle.

67
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,717
And I‐‐I can't ignore
it, so I have to go,

68
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:00,182
and I'd like you to join

69
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,983
or at least watch and be a good friend.

70
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:03,308
<i>Stay low, Sam.</i>

71
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:08,622
Lock your hands.

72
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:11,958
Slam him!

73
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:13,997
Hey, m‐‐mr. Brown.

74
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:16,512
I'd like to join wrestling, please.

75
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:18,388
Mm‐hmm.

76
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:21,726
Like, join the wrestling
team and stuff.

77
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,346
Your calves get any bigger,

78
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:24,734
you're gonna fall through the floor.

79
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:25,902
Thanks, coach.

80
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,781
‐ that's not something we do here.

81
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,780
Why, 'cause I'm a girl?

82
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:33,254
And I'm, like, stronger than
everyone here, probably.

83
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,629
Uh, yeah. You could get seriously hurt.

84
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:39,339
‐ well, um, I think it'd be
kind of messed up and illegal

85
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:41,144
if you didn't let me. ‐ levels, levels.

86
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
‐ and I could probably report it.

87
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,812
‐ okay. Fine.

88
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:45,482
You can shadow.

89
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,941
Go stand over there and watch.

90
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:49,283
‐ okay. Thanks, coach.

91
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:54,833
When you come in here, I
want you ready to wrestle.

92
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,554
‐ coach is making me shadow.

93
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,468
‐ dude, switch with me. ‐ sure.

94
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:06,572
‐ whenever Brandt touches his balls,

95
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,106
it means he wants a hand job.

96
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,490
‐ bro, shut up.

97
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:11,368
- Focus, focus, focus.
- Shut up.

98
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,947
So stupid.

99
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,879
‐ reach in and grab
all your rage inside

100
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,298
and let it out.

101
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:19,967
This is the place to do it,

102
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:23,308
not on your mom, not on your date.

103
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,517
Handle it like a man.

104
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:28,651
Destroy something privately,
or, better yet, on a team.

105
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:40,172
Nice!

106
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,231
Mr. - drive it! Drive it!

107
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,110
Drive it! Drive it! Drive it!

108
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,109
Nice, zablowski.

109
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:53,743
- Good job.
- ‐

110
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,794
‐ that was dope. ‐ thanks.

111
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,511
Sam cock‐block‐‐ so annoying.

112
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:02,005
Mr. brown, I'm, like, ready to wrestle.

113
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,890
I've learned a lot from shadowing.

114
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,769
‐ fine. Tj, partner up with Maya.

115
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,570
She says she's ready to wrestle.

116
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:11,445
‐ coach, I don't want to.

117
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:13,865
‐ come on, let's go.

118
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,867
‐ okay.

119
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:24,143
Now? Okay.

120
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:26,347
Stupid.

121
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:35,867
I wasn't ready. Like, what the hell?

122
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,249
Coach, can we stop?

123
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,207
I feel weird.

124
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,379
‐ fine, if he doesn't wanna wrestle,

125
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:42,718
I'll wrestle anybody else, honestly.

126
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:44,796
Anybody. Just raise your hand.

127
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,434
Like, I'm ready to frickin' go.

128
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,769
Brandt, whatever‐‐ if you want to.

129
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:57,709
<i>Making her way to the ring,</i>

130
00:07:57,705 --> 00:08:00,625
<i>Trish stratus!</i>

131
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,217
‐ why don't you just,
like, talk to him, then?

132
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:04,585
‐ 'cause I don't wanna be like,

133
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,264
"hey, I'm terra newback.

134
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:07,733
"Let me just talk to
you for a long time

135
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:08,975
while you're bored as hell, Brandt."

136
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:11,687
Like... I'm not freakin' desperate.

137
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,911
I just want him to know I'm
hanging around and stuff.

138
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:17,746
‐ Maya, I don't wanna hear
about Brandt anymore.

139
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:19,865
‐ okay, well, that's fine
'cause I'm not talking to you.

140
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,214
I'm talking to Andy. ‐ who's that?

141
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:23,632
You serious?

142
00:08:23,632 --> 00:08:26,092
You've never heard of Trish stratus?

143
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:27,564
‐ Trish stratus.

144
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,136
‐ her muscles are gross.

145
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,022
‐ yeah. No, she's slutty.

146
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:32,781
‐ yeah. ‐ yo, Trish is hot.

147
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,775
She's got my mad respect.

148
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:38,623
‐ hmm. Okay.

149
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:43,092
Oh, shit! ‐ okay, I can do that...
Easily.

150
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,467
‐ no, you can't, dummy. ‐ yes, I can!

151
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,466
Are you frickin' serious? Look at me.

152
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,110
‐ Maya, no offense but, like,
this b could take you.

153
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,315
‐ Doubt that.

154
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:55,315
‐ okay, that's what tj mulligan thought

155
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:56,529
before I freakin' kicked his ass.

156
00:08:56,531 --> 00:08:57,951
- Did you see that?
- Oh, really?

157
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,240
Oh, what way am I gonna go, bitch?

158
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:01,294
Or, what, bitch? Come at me, bitch.

159
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,590
‐ your dad can't eat anything.

160
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,125
‐ guys, move. You're blocking the TV.

161
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,049
- ‐ he wants to destroy your ass.
- Oh, yeah?

162
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,599
Your dad eats soggy potatoes.

163
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,425
‐ and it makes him fart
on your face, Anna!

164
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:10,931
You're going down.

165
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,154
Put your money where your mouth is.

166
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:14,145
I'm putting my butt on your face.

167
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,189
You're cheating. You cannot do that.

168
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:17,574
‐ hey, yo, go, get her, Maya.

169
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,833
- Stop it.
- You're gonna die,

170
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,867
and I'm gonna be alive.

171
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:24,133
You're so frickin' weak, Maya.

172
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:26,507
No! Who's weak now, bitch?

173
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,007
I won.

174
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:36,436
Mom. The anna‐sthetizer
wants to put you to sleep.

175
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,493
Aah!

176
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:39,027
Oh, sorry.

177
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:41,332
But I just‐‐it's like that,
we were just wrestling,

178
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:43,538
and it was like, "I'm
the anna‐ihilator."

179
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,841
Anna.

180
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,377
I have a migraine from
doing energy work all day.

181
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:49,974
‐ well, I've been wrestling all day.

182
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,430
Like, don't make me flip you.

183
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,653
‐ could you take that
gross pillow to your dad?

184
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:56,227
He left it on my side of the house.

185
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,453
‐ yeah, that's fine, just
bring it to his room.

186
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:00,405
And quietly, please. ‐ okay.

187
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:01,988
‐ I can't take it.

188
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:07,506
Dad? ‐

189
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:12,392
dad? Mm‐hmm.

190
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,730
‐ um, do we have channel 151?

191
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,071
'Cause I want my <i>Monday nights raw.</i>

192
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:19,198
- ‐ what?
<i>- Raw.</i>

193
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:21,065
I want my <i>Monday nights raw.</i>

194
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:24,624
I‐‐I‐‐I think we get,
like, to channel one...

195
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:26,963
Hey, what's that pillow doing in here?

196
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,261
‐ mom just said to bring it to you

197
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:30,967
because you left it on
her side of the house.

198
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:34,389
‐ I told her already; She
can take it to the dump.

199
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:35,942
But you know your mother.

200
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:38,477
I mean, she does whatever she
wants, whenever she wants.

201
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:42,494
Don't leave the pillow.
I don't want it.

202
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:45,673
‐ okay.

203
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:47,995
I just never pictured

204
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:52,263
your mom and I's marriage going
quite this way, you know.

205
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,181
I've never been more in
love with anybody but her

206
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:55,642
my whole life.

207
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:57,024
‐ oh, yeah?

208
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:58,821
Yet you can still end up

209
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,607
sort of hating people anyway.

210
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:05,196
You know, if I'm the one that
ends up having to move out‐‐

211
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:08,004
even if I can only
afford an apartment‐‐

212
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,921
I'm not gonna resent it.

213
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,141
I just want you and
your mom to be happy.

214
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:19,323
<i>Life can pummel you down, sweetie.</i>

215
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,241
<i>I hope you learn how to pummel back.</i>

216
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:28,462
‐ take me now. The anna‐ihilator!

217
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,685
Get up... Get up!

218
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,361
Ooh! Ah!

219
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:45,123
You want some of this?

220
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:47,584
'Sup?

221
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,842
You're hot and strong.

222
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:53,757
You got my mad respect.

223
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,125
So my mom took me to kinko's...

224
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:12,587
Latest installment of <i>weasels.</i>

225
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,429
Which one do you think is better?

226
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:16,595
I think glossy really
makes it pop, you know?

227
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:18,097
‐ cool.

228
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:22,017
‐ hello? Hey, dude.

229
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:23,994
I was up until, like, 10:00 doing this.

230
00:12:23,987 --> 00:12:26,527
Glossy or matte? ‐ no, either's great.

231
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:28,834
Okay? Yo, hey.

232
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,580
Ha.

233
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,713
What's up, zablowski?

234
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,211
Hey.

235
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:35,723
I'll see you later.
Yo, Brandt, wait up!

236
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:41,899
‐ glossy it is, then.

237
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,083
Mr. brown.

238
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,792
‐ Mr. brown.

239
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:54,264
‐ I just thought practice yesterday

240
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:55,625
was really inspiring. ‐ yeah.

241
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:57,183
‐ your team is well‐oiled,

242
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:59,768
and I was just honing in my skills

243
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,437
just about all night last night.

244
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:04,646
And... Do you wanna see them?
You don't have to.

245
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,991
But I'll just show you.

246
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:09,039
‐ Anna! ‐ and then you take it down

247
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,615
to brown town. ‐ stop.

248
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,633
‐ well, Maya, I guess you have someone

249
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,008
to fart around with at
practice, so that's something.

250
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,297
‐ well, um, I would love that,

251
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:20,183
except I already wrestled her a bunch.

252
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:22,482
I don't really feel like that's
challenging enough for me.

253
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:24,398
I was just thinking I could maybe

254
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:27,148
take on Brandt at the mock
meet on Friday or whatever.

255
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:29,494
‐ well, I already beat her
a bunch of times. Well‐‐

256
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:32,502
‐ Brandt's the... Best
wrestler in school.

257
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:34,248
Plus, you're different weight classes.

258
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:35,462
Oh, that's okay.

259
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:37,342
Maya and I can just partner up.

260
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:39,931
‐ Um...

261
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,810
Just out of curiosity;

262
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,019
how much weight do I have to gain

263
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:46,071
to be in Brandt's class?

264
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,987
‐ you'd have to gain at least
6 to 12 pounds in a week,

265
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,080
which is unhealthy at your
age and could mess you up.

266
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:54,287
So please don't try it.

267
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:56,957
‐ we won't.

268
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:58,974
We won't. ‐ we won't.

269
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,861
You're doing it for me,

270
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,525
but you're doing it for yourself too.

271
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:10,025
‐ clear, Maya, go! Clear, Maya, go!

272
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:11,582
Yeah, mai. You're bulking.

273
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:14,457
And you can't stop.

274
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:16,877
‐

275
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,464
‐ this is what it takes.

276
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:42,934
It's better with a little bit extra...

277
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,090
- ‐ no, little bitch.

278
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,690
‐ ha!

279
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:07,982
- ‐ sick.

280
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:15,752
You guys, I'm slamming
down the Mac and cheese.

281
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:18,457
Student can I have a bite of yours?

282
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,050
Um, here's the thing.

283
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:23,297
If you put peanut butter on the
hard‐boiled egg, that's the trick.

284
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:25,813
‐ what‐‐what trick?
How is that a trick?

285
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,398
‐ that is a trick. You get "yolked."

286
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:30,736
That's what, um, Trish stratus does.

287
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:33,485
She's hot. ‐ yeah, she is hot.

288
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,450
‐ and muscle weighs more than fat.

289
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:36,962
‐ Muscle weighs more than fat.

290
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,245
‐ that's what people don't realize.

291
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:41,379
‐ anyway, bro. Coach
brown got that new mat.

292
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,130
I'm gonna wrestle yo' ass.

293
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:46,184
So if you're gaining pounds‐‐lbs‐‐

294
00:15:46,182 --> 00:15:48,232
that's not a bad thing.

295
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:50,268
‐ anyway, I'm gonna go hit the gym.
That was so funny

296
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:51,823
when you did that the other day.

297
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:53,399
You gonna eat all your peaches?

298
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,205
Oh, you don't say "bye" now?

299
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:01,796
Oh, my god, the protein's
going to her fat‐ass head.

300
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,677
I'm just kidding.

301
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:09,692
Take a picture. It'll
last longer, you guys.

302
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,945
Girls are so annoying, honestly.

303
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,026
Hammer fist!

304
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:19,747
Nailed him.

305
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:09,386
It's like I'm stalking you.

306
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:13,653
Just kidding.

307
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,419
Are you mad at me?

308
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:30,104
‐ why'd you join wrestling?

309
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:34,612
‐ 'cause I love ww.

310
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,358
‐

311
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,570
‐ I have for years, seriously.

312
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:46,547
I'm, like, sorry people
know about our three‐way.

313
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:48,638
‐ yeah.

314
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,357
‐ are you pissed?

315
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:01,082
‐ yeah.

316
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,759
‐ seriously, I'll do anything
I can to make it up to you.

317
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:13,893
Anything.

318
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,530
‐ yeah? Like what?

319
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:23,787
What?

320
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,017
If you take out the yolk of the egg...

321
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:37,571
You fill it with peanut butter,

322
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,527
it's truly like Reese's pieces.

323
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:40,989
How can you say "no"?

324
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,490
It tastes like my dog's ass.

325
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:45,002
Anna! You can't tell the difference.

326
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,378
I was gonna lift a tenner.

327
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,745
Be back soon.

328
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:49,884
Anna. Okay.

329
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,643
<i>Come on, stop‐‐ Anna: I don't know why</i>

330
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,138
- you keep doing this.
- Stop talking.

331
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:55,441
You want me to get jacked or not?

332
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,555
‐ literally, I was this close

333
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:57,863
to getting my first kiss with Brandt.

334
00:18:57,857 --> 00:18:59,147
‐ how was I supposed to know that?

335
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:00,321
I didn't know that.
That's amazing, though.

336
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,700
Congratulations. ‐ no. Thank you.

337
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:03,658
It's fine, it's great. But
it doesn't keep happening

338
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,950
because you keep interrupting.

339
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:06,374
You keep walking in on us. Like...

340
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:08,343
‐ okay, well, I think that
you should learn to use

341
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:09,956
a lock on a door if you don't
want people to walk in.

342
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:11,934
‐ well, honestly, I don't
wanna creep him out.

343
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:14,887
So I'm just closing the door,
and I'm not locking it,

344
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:16,811
'cause I'm not crazy.

345
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,485
I know it's not personal,

346
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:24,659
but every time I'm alone
with him, you walk in.

347
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,001
And, honestly, like, Brandt and I‐‐

348
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,088
he doesn't really know
it yet, but, like,

349
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,796
we want time alone together.

350
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:32,258
'Cause if we don't have
time alone together,

351
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:34,139
then we're not gonna be
able to get to the point

352
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,677
- where I have my first kiss.
- Okay.

353
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:37,903
It's just like, you're
like, "Brandt..."

354
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:39,725
‐ shh.

355
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:41,112
‐ no, you're always like, "Brandt..."

356
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,620
‐ shh!

357
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,945
‐ it's just like, you're
like, "Brandt, Brandt,

358
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,371
"Brandt, Brandt, Brandt... ‐ stop.
Okay, okay, okay.

359
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,500
- ‐ "Brandt, Brandt, Brandt."
- Stop!

360
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:48,537
‐ and I'm like, "I
can't do it anymore."

361
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,922
‐ stop! ‐ Brandt!

362
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,839
- ‐ stop it, Anna!
- What?

363
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,180
‐ you're saying his name so lou‐‐

364
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:55,175
like, you're crazy, honestly.

365
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:01,283
- ‐ is that your hair?
- No.

366
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:03,355
- ‐ is that Brandt's locker?
- No.

367
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:05,872
- ‐ Maya.
- Stop saying his name.

368
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:10,792
‐ so, you and Maya in here, alone, huh?

369
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,934
So that‐‐that was like...

370
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:16,176
‐ she keeps following me around, man.

371
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,270
‐ well, you hooked up with
both her and kone, right?

372
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,727
Barely.

373
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:22,569
I mean, I don't wanna get
near their big‐ass bushes.

374
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:24,818
Their pussies smell like fish, dawg.

375
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:27,292
I mean, these fingers are clean.

376
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,075
Can't get that stank on me.

377
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,343
‐ big, smelly bush.

378
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,129
Oh, shit.

379
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,354
Anna and Maya are bsbs‐‐
big, smelly bushes.

380
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:39,349
Bro.

381
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,111
‐ tuna‐kone.

382
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:46,067
‐ yo, zablowski, you're funny, man.

383
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:54,755
Flyweight.

384
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:56,337
Middleweight. Middleweight.

385
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:57,643
Middleweight.

386
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:05,109
Jesus Christ, kone. Middleweight.

387
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:06,491
What did you do?

388
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:09,997
‐ Come on.

389
00:21:13,044 --> 00:21:16,514
‐ another middleweight. ‐ really?

390
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,679
Does that mean I get to wrestle Brandt?

391
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,480
‐ you made weight, but the
pairs are set already.

392
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:22,977
First round is you versus blondie.

393
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,690
Whoever wins gets to wrestle

394
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:27,112
the winner of, uh, Brandt and Sam.

395
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:39,183
Who do you think's gonna win?

396
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,599
‐ I don't even know‐‐may‐‐
maybe‐‐maybe Sam.

397
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:43,693
Drive it! ‐ maybe.

398
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,323
Use your legs, Sam. Use your legs.

399
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:49,865
Nice, zablowski.

400
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,885
That was good.

401
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:02,019
That was great.

402
00:22:10,324 --> 00:22:11,954
Get off.

403
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:17,799
Stop! No.

404
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:19,798
No.

405
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:24,058
Let me win, Anna.

406
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,940
No.

407
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:27,989
‐ I need to get to Brandt. Stop.

408
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:29,985
‐ no.

409
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:36,752
Oh‐‐

410
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:39,053
I got you. Lookit...

411
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,059
You stay. You stay!

412
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:43,425
She's out.

413
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:52,202
‐ good match, bsb.

414
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,463
‐ where's Brandt?

415
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,222
‐ zablowski beat Brandt.

416
00:23:00,216 --> 00:23:02,426
‐ you ready for this, bowl cut?

417
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:04,682
‐ don't call me that.

418
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:10,397
Fold him like a ham sandwich.

419
00:23:12,783 --> 00:23:14,203
Is that all you got, bowl cut?

420
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:15,452
Stop calling me that!

421
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:16,464
I'm not calling you that.

422
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:17,996
I'm calling you "bowl cut."

423
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,462
Stop it!

424
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:22,592
- Freakin' asshole!
- Language.

425
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:24,974
Is that all you got?

426
00:23:24,974 --> 00:23:26,064
Get off.

427
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:27,689
You're ruining everything right now.

428
00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:29,358
I shouldn't even be wrestling you.

429
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:31,647
Well, at least I didn't
have a three‐way

430
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:32,994
in the closet with Brandt.

431
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,700
‐ yeah? You're just jealous

432
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:36,752
no one would go to the
frickin' closet with you.

433
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,050
Whoo‐whoo!

434
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:43,758
Whatever, bsb.

435
00:23:43,762 --> 00:23:45,142
What?

436
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:47,019
At least I don't have a big, hairy bush

437
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:49,228
that smells like fish.

438
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,230
What?

439
00:23:53,322 --> 00:23:55,872
‐ I didn't say that. Brandt
and the guys said that.

440
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:01,842
Come on, fight, let's go.
It's‐‐it's not a big deal.

441
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,179
It's just a‐‐it's just a joke.

442
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,385
Come on, let's go. ‐ no, stop!

443
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,771
‐ it's just a joke.

444
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:20,383
Match?

445
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,620
Here she is, star of the party.

446
00:24:39,623 --> 00:24:41,463
There's my little athlete. ‐ ow.

447
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,420
‐ you win some, you lose some.
‐ ow, stop it.

448
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,344
‐ oh, no. I'm so sorry.

449
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,814
Did I hurt you? ‐ no.

450
00:24:47,806 --> 00:24:49,056
‐ mai, sorry.

451
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:51,268
I just thought that's
what our buddies do.

452
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:53,571
You ok‐‐you okay?

453
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:55,948
‐ they're, um‐‐ ‐ what?

454
00:24:55,947 --> 00:25:00,917
‐ they're calling us "big,
smelly bush" ‐‐bsb.

455
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,496
‐ wait. What?

456
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:03,843
Us?

457
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:08,056
Oh.

458
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:10,774
Oh, like, what is‐‐what is that?

459
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:13,269
Like‐‐ ‐ it's our pussies, na.

460
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:15,783
Our pussies.

461
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:17,989
That's what the guys
have been calling us.

462
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:21,251
They've been saying that our vaginas
are hairy and smell like fish.

463
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:23,668
‐ what? The guys?

464
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,720
Yeah. ‐ no, but they're my friends.

465
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:28,047
‐ yeah, well, they aren't anymore.

466
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:32,349
‐ you can't trust anyone! Ow!

467
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:37,197
‐ Anyone but you.

468
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:41,997
Our pussies!

469
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,250
It's okay.

470
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:49,601
Weasel‐shark.

471
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:53,097
Half‐weasel, half‐shark will
kill you and your family.

472
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:55,193
‐ yo, zablowski.

473
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,610
Yo, what up?

474
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,031
Yo, Sam.

475
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,580
What happened with
maya‐‐ you get a boner?

476
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:01,827
I said "bsb" to her,

477
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,629
and I probably shouldn't
have said that.

478
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:04,915
Hey, Sam, you coming?

479
00:26:04,918 --> 00:26:06,838
Yeah, I'm coming. Hold up.

480
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,589
Ooh, ooh! Oh!

481
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:13,385
‐ wait. Did he just... Leave?

482
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:15,863
I thought we were gonna hang out.

483
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,527
‐ let's just go.

484
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:19,527
Wrestling's kind of gay.

485
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,963
<i>One, two, three.</i>

486
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:31,757
Oh, my god. Are you looking?

487
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:34,846
Yeah.

488
00:26:36,524 --> 00:26:38,284
I don't know. It's kind of weird.

489
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:43,962
‐ I can't tell if it's,
like, big, but...

490
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:45,745
<i>Can you smell anything?</i>

491
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:50,676
‐ Yeah.

492
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,467
Do you?

493
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:57,982
‐ I think I smell something,
but it might not be that.

494
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:01,363
I don't know. 'Cause my
mom's cooking, so...

495
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:06,171
‐ I'm gonna try mixing
it with something.

496
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,256
‐ okay, yeah. Maybe I have something.

497
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:17,814
Ow!

498
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:19,034
‐ are you okay, Maya?

499
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:20,355
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

500
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,320
<i>I think I burned it.</i>

501
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:26,123
‐ be careful with it. Maybe
it doesn't like that.

502
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:29,132
‐

503
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:39,821
‐ I only have lip gloss.

504
00:27:39,816 --> 00:27:43,616
‐ it feels like a little... Animal.

505
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:48,084
Hmm.

506
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:54,097
Meow. Meow!

507
00:27:54,095 --> 00:27:55,885
Meow!

508
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,520
I need a little catnip.

509
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:03,658
Fly!

510
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,950
Are you still there?

511
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:09,714
- ‐ mm‐hmm.
<i>- I'm gonna go.</i>

512
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,420
‐ love you, bye.

513
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:12,801
<i>Bye.</i>

514
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,140
‐

515
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:41,356
<i>Meow! Meow!</i>

516
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:45,783
<i>Fly!</i>
