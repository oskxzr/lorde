1
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,958
Oh, is‐‐is your mom not home?

2
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,249
Nah, she's never home.

3
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,133
You guys wanna go in first?

4
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,796
Cool.

5
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,181
‐ Is it okay to just‐‐

6
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,847
Put Daddy...

7
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,900
I'm gonna take my jacket off.

8
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,728
‐ What?
‐ I'm gonna take my jacket off.

9
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,903
‐ Okay.

10
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,777
So what should we do?

11
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,989
‐ Whatever.

12
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,622
Okay.

13
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,368
‐ Do you have
any snacks, babe?

14
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:48,254
Yeah, they're in the freezer
over there.

15
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,421
‐ Over...

16
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,089
Over there. Through the door.

17
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,549
‐ Look here, um‐‐
‐ What chord was that?

18
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,801
- Which one?
- See you.

19
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,643
Just kidding.

20
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,928
JK.

21
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,435
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Totally.

22
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,056
‐ Oh, my God.
Is this what I look like?

23
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,523
‐ You look amazing.

24
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,903
I am so hungry, though. Like‐‐

25
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,979
‐ Oh, my God.

26
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,033
Wait, look at this freezer.

27
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,237
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

28
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,358
‐ I'm so‐‐

29
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,824
Wait, are those marshmallows?

30
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,284
- Okay.
- Here.

31
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,794
Oh, my God.

32
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,326
I'm so hungry.

33
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:27,957
You don't want
to go home, right?

34
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,958
Like, you're not worried
at all?

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,590
‐ Mm‐mm. I'm not worried.

36
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,047
Unless you want to‐‐

37
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,627
Do you want to go home
or do you want to stay?

38
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,013
‐ I want to hang out
with our boyfriends.

39
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,600
‐ Okay, yeah.
I don't want to go home.

40
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,676
‐ You're, like, gonna get
your first kiss.

41
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,142
‐ No, I'm not, stop.

42
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,522
Oh, stop!

43
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,348
I don't know.

44
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,863
Is my breath okay?

45
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,436
‐ No, it smells amazing.
How's mine?

46
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,485
I'm sorry, it's not good.
‐ Oh, Maya.

47
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,368
‐ Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
‐ No.

48
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,615
Here we go.

49
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,752
This song's awesome, man.

50
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,616
Heck yeah.

51
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,214
Let me do it.

52
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,879
Cool. Cool. Cool.

53
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,716
‐ Don't touch my butt.
‐ I didn't.

54
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,891
‐ Wait, would you play
that chord again?

55
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,467
This one right here?

56
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,102
‐ Yeah.

57
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,518
Very good. Cool. Cool.

58
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,271
‐ Could you cut out
the drumming?

59
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,654
We're trying to hit this.
You're throwing me off.

60
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,491
‐ I think that your drumming
sounds good.

61
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:43,067
Yeah, it's just not
matchin' up with our rhythm.

62
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,374
‐ Steve, her dad's
a professional drummer.

63
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,038
So...
‐ Oh, stop.

64
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,497
‐ He is, though.
You shouldn't be humble.

65
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,247
‐ I'm not.
‐ Excellent! Get up.

66
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,538
Okay, I'm sorry.

67
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,751
Get up, get up, go!

68
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,722
One, two, three.

69
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,925
Cool, cool, cool.

70
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,507
Excellent! Cool.

71
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,722
Sorry.

72
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,732
- Are you being bad?
- Sorry.

73
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,806
‐ You want to check out
my watch?

74
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,943
‐ Yeah.

75
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:22,989
- Ooh!
- Stop.

76
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,199
‐ You look good. Sorry.

77
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,453
I'm cold.

78
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,873
Thanks, Steve.

79
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,172
‐ Yeah.
‐ What kind is it?

80
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,997
‐ Eh, some kind of army.
It's got the army paint on it.

81
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,640
What are you doing?

82
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,693
I'm just‐‐'cause I'm cold.

83
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,727
We're both cold.

84
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,233
Okay.

85
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,598
‐ You want to go
to my room?

86
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,555
‐ Okay.

87
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,378
‐ Sorry, can we just do
over the shirt?

88
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,508
‐ Huh?
‐ Can we just do over it?

89
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,144
Do you like it
without my braces?

90
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,216
‐ I like it.
Less cuts.

91
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,606
‐ Who's that?

92
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,317
That's Gillian Anderson.

93
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,397
‐ No, below that.

94
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,453
- Oh.
- Is that, like,

95
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,105
your ex‐girlfriend or whatever?

96
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,284
- I'm not mad.
- No, no.

97
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,701
That's my friend.

98
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,501
I don't think about her.

99
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,785
Did you bring your meds?

100
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,459
‐ Um, no, they don't
really work for me.

101
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,670
Sorry. Is that okay?

102
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,222
‐ I guess.

103
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,727
‐ Is this your first time?

104
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,445
‐ Yeah. Is it yours?

105
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,487
‐ No. I've done it a lot.

106
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,830
Like, a couple times.
‐ Yeah.

107
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,826
‐ Yeah.

108
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,963
‐ You mean, a BJ right?

109
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,627
You've had
your first kiss before.

110
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,760
‐ Y‐‐uh. Yeah, obviously.

111
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,599
Like, I've had
a bunch of first kisses.

112
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,388
‐ Cool.

113
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,109
‐ I'm ready.

114
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,908
‐ Oh, sorry.
‐ That's all right.

115
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,105
Let me just‐‐
‐ Keep going.

116
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,164
‐ Okay.

117
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,453
‐ Wait, wait, wait, wait.

118
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,544
‐ Come on.

119
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,170
No.

120
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,957
You think Maya's
a good drummer, right?

121
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,165
‐ I mean, I guess.

122
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,342
‐ Well, You didn't have
her back back there,

123
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,683
and you didn't have, like,
her dad's back,

124
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,178
'cause you only had
Derrick's back.

125
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,970
And it's, like,
who's back do you have?

126
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,064
‐ I love you.

127
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,400
‐ Don't change the subject.

128
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,691
‐ Say it back.

129
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,152
Say it.

130
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,735
‐ I love you too.

131
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,259
Come on, let's take it off.

132
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,378
‐ Get it‐‐
‐ Ahh.

133
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,184
Actually, get this.

134
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,177
Okay.

135
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,271
Do you want to‐‐you could‐‐

136
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,858
‐ Whoa.

137
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,752
What's wrong with your balls?

138
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,286
‐ What do you mean?

139
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,880
‐ Why don't you have
two balls?

140
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,246
‐ What?

141
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,512
Oh, there are two,
it's just they're inside.

142
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,795
It's not like there's a‐‐

143
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,638
‐ Oh, so it's like
the line is‐‐

144
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,925
‐ The line? What line?

145
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,729
‐ The line‐‐it's like
it has its own carrying case.

146
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,265
‐ Yeah. I guess.

147
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,809
Do you want to stop
talking about it?

148
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,152
‐ Yeah. Sorry.

149
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,437
Yeah.

150
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,570
- Okay.
- So I'm gonna start now.

151
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,664
Uh...

152
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,839
‐ What's wrong?

153
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,339
‐ I finished.

154
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,301
‐ I didn't cum.
‐ Oh.

155
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,222
‐ Yeah, that's not‐‐
‐ Yeah?

156
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,221
‐ That's an important part,
right?

157
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,602
‐ Okay, I'm gonna do it.

158
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,598
Okay.

159
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,572
‐ Ah, ah! Teeth, teeth!

160
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,410
‐ Ah, sorry.
‐ Yeah, they're‐‐

161
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,115
They're just kind of, like,
dragging.

162
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,235
‐ Okay.

163
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,919
‐ Like that?
‐ Mm.

164
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,259
Like that?

165
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,872
Mm‐hmm.

166
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:15,843
Mm.

167
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:27,888
Thanks.

168
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,774
Do you want to kiss?

169
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,493
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

170
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,985
Oh.

171
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,607
‐ But, I'm gonna be‐‐

172
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,004
Maya?

173
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,090
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

174
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,245
I'm still‐‐
‐ Maya?

175
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:05,886
- Ew. Ew, ew, ew, ew.
- Are you okay?

176
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:06,927
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

177
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:07,929
‐ Did you just get
your first kiss?

178
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,350
Mine was so disgusting.

179
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,518
Like, I got mine with Brendan,
you know I hated it.

180
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,687
And now, like, Steve is, like‐‐
We have it perfectly down.

181
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,767
So kissing's just like that.

182
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,943
Maya, are you okay?

183
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,033
‐ I just gave him
a blow job.

184
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,124
‐ You got your kiss
and you got a blow job.

185
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,327
‐ I didn't do‐‐I just‐‐

186
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,922
‐ Oh.
‐ I just, like‐‐

187
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,089
‐ Amazing.

188
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,667
‐ Yeah. Is it?

189
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,632
Yeah.

190
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,763
But, what was it like?
Did you like it?

191
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,639
Did he like it?
‐ Um, I don't know.

192
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:51,386
I, like, think he did,
'cause he just, like‐‐

193
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,810
it was, like, weird,
and then he, like, came.

194
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,230
‐ Oh, my God,
are you serious?

195
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,309
‐ Yeah.

196
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,364
‐ Wow. So cool.

197
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,779
‐ I know.

198
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,067
And you were, like‐‐

199
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,990
You were, like,
"Wow, yeah. You're amazing."

200
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,829
‐ I don't think I want
to do a blow job again, though.

201
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,656
‐ Oh, yeah. Yeah.

202
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,411
‐ I probably am not gonna ever.

203
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,712
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

204
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,955
'Cause it was, like, gross

205
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,457
'cause of the, like‐‐
like, the‐‐

206
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,418
‐ Can we just, like, go home?
‐ Oh, yeah.

207
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,878
- Yeah, we can go home.
- Okay.

208
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,208
‐ Steve, can you drive us home?
‐ Shh!

209
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,932
‐ Let's‐‐let's call Shuji.

210
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,756
Let's call Shuji.
‐ Okay.

211
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,801
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

212
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,974
‐ Okay!

213
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,312
‐ Steve?

214
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,515
Steve! Steven?

215
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,535
Is everything okay?

216
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Yeah.

217
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,001
‐ It's fine.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

218
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,168
‐ All right.

219
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,801
‐ That's him.
‐ Who's that?

220
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,601
‐ It's my brother.

221
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,064
Hi, Shuji.

222
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,059
I don't want to know
what happened.

223
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,851
Okay, I'm sorry.

224
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,404
You guys take the bike, okay?

225
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,317
- Okay.
- Thank you.

226
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,686
Um, let's just‐‐yeah.

227
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,192
- I got it.
- Okay.

228
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,784
Here, I got you. I got it.

229
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
‐ I love you.

230
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,874
‐ Love you too.

231
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,789
‐ Do you have that?
‐ Yeah.

232
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,457
‐ Go.
‐ Peace.

233
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,949
Just do Saturday,

234
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,713
then you can just come
and get her.

235
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,495
And then she can sleep in
Friday and‐‐

236
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,999
no.

237
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,591
No!

238
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,166
I'll just leave her stuff out
by the front door.

239
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,302
Otherwise, you pick her up
Saturday.

240
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,890
Like, let her sleep in, though.

241
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,925
You know, till 2:00.

242
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,100
Hi, hon.
‐ Hey.

243
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,689
Or you pick her up from school

244
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,265
and then you get her stuff,
and then you go.

245
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,481
Um. Okay.

246
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,571
Whatever.

247
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,397
Um, how was Maya's?

248
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,703
You didn't sleep over?

249
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,367
I was just talking to your dad

250
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,747
about you going over
to his this weekend.

251
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,495
Anna's home.

252
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,916
Okay. He wants to talk to you.

253
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,431
‐ Hey, Dad.

254
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,216
‐ How's it going, goof?

255
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,429
You still mad at us?

256
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:04,641
‐ Um, I just, like,
have some bad news actually,

257
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,904
'cause, um,

258
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:11,566
a golden retriever
killed Daddy.

259
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,647
And it's my fault.

260
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,783
Don't say it's your fault.

261
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,279
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

262
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,450
What‐‐what happened?

263
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,448
Did the dog steal him?

264
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,910
Um, I kind of put it
on the dog's head.

265
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,544
And that's why it's my fault.

266
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,790
- Sorry.
- Well.

267
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,253
Just, you know,
maybe don't do that again.

268
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,554
All right?
You gotta learn from it.

269
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,888
But the dog was wrong, too,
right?

270
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,305
‐ Yeah, the dog was wrong too.

271
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,305
Yeah.

272
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,886
‐ And also, like...

273
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,603
I love Steve.

274
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,653
‐ Aw.
‐ Really?

275
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,016
‐ Um, mom.
‐ What?

276
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,484
But I also don't know
about him.

277
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,904
‐ Well, what'd your mom say?

278
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,283
‐ Um.
‐ Here.

279
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,489
Put her on speaker phone.

280
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,280
Kathy?

281
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,453
She loves him.

282
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,371
‐ I didn't know.
She didn't tell me.

283
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,160
‐ But I don't know
'cause he doesn't, like,

284
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,003
always listen to my feelings,

285
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,038
and I don't know
about his best friend.

286
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,923
He just doesn't take me
seriously.

287
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,511
‐ Well, I don't like that.

288
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,336
But I also want to marry him.

289
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,138
It's not funny.

290
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,887
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ Don't laugh, Dad.

291
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,138
‐ I'm not laughing.

292
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,390
Just fix it.

293
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,521
‐ Oh, sweetie.

294
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,148
We can't fix everything,
you know that.

295
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,606
But we can listen, okay?

296
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,399
‐ Okay.

297
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,622
Dad?

298
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,076
What are you doing?
‐ Vacuuming.

299
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,038
Oh, hey, I got the plastic
off the oven.

300
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,209
‐ Proud of you, Dad.

301
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,165
Derrick!

302
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,825
Yeah, my snake's been acting
real sweet lately.

303
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,173
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

304
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,418
‐ This is private.
‐ She's always taking

305
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,629
her tongue out...
‐ Tell him.

306
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,879
- Tell him.
- And licking me.

307
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
I know she's just smelling,
but‐‐

308
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,011
‐ When are you gonna tell him?

309
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,177
- Um, wait.
- Huh?

310
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:46,386
‐ Okay, it's been 21 minutes
of us talking on the phone.

311
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,888
I feel like that's
our longest yet, babe.

312
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,021
Derrick:
Yeah. Oh, hold up.

313
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,478
I gotta grab‐‐I gotta go grab

314
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,938
the snake something...
‐ Oh, okay‐‐

315
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,228
Then I gotta
tell you something.

316
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,731
‐ Okay.
Okay, what? He's on hold.

317
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,073
‐ Okay, so you're gonna say,

318
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,738
"If you still want
to go out with me,

319
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,066
I can't give you another BJ."

320
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,531
‐ I want to go out
with him.

321
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,411
I just don't want
to give him a BJ again.

322
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,407
‐ And medicine 'cause
my doctor prescribed it.

323
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,369
‐ Shh!
Anna, I already told him

324
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,370
that part yesterday.

325
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,871
‐ Okay!
‐ Okay.

326
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,083
Wait, nah. Open your mouth.

327
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,094
‐ What?
‐ Your tooth.

328
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,496
‐ What?
What's wrong with my tooth?

329
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,014
‐ Oh, my God!

330
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,215
What happened?
‐ No, I just got my braces off!

331
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,836
‐ It looks crazy.

332
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,054
No!

333
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,064
Anna.

334
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,385
No, no, no.

335
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,180
This is why I got braces!
Are you kidding me?

336
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,404
‐ I mean, honestly,
I like you better that way.

337
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,805
‐ With a snaggle?

338
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,653
I'm gonna have to get
my braces back on.

339
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,398
You still there?

340
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,860
‐ Hi, yeah.

341
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,900
Turn on the radio
to HOT 106.7.

342
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,073
‐ What‐‐okay, um.

343
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,492
Anna. Anna!

344
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,700
He just said put the radio on.
Put it on‐‐on 106.7.

345
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,792
‐ Did he get you
concert tickets?

346
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,906
‐ I don't know!

347
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,962
‐ Did he get us
concert tickets?

348
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,958
Got it.

349
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,053
‐ Okay, it's on, it's on.

350
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,416
I freaking love this song.

351
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,673
- You listening?
- Yeah.

352
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,094
I'm listening.

353
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,182
Good.

354
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,136
Every time you hear this song,

355
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,177
think about how
I'm breaking up with you.

356
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,141
'Cause that's
what I'm doing right now.

357
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:17,313
Man it's a hot one

358
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:21,443
Like seven inches
from the midday sun

359
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:26,412
Well, I hear you whisper
and the words melt everyone

360
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,615
But you stay so cool

361
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:35,118
And if you said
this life ain't good enough

362
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:39,082
I would give my world
to lift you up

363
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,714
I could change my life

364
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:45,132
To better suit your mood

365
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,101
'Cause you're so smooth

366
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:56,099
And it's just like the ocean
under the moon

367
00:23:56,101 --> 00:24:00,481
It's the same as the emotion
that I get from you

368
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:04,611
You the kind of loving
that can be so smooth, yeah

369
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,150
Give me your heart,
make it real

370
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,324
Or else forget about it

371
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,413
It's just like the ocean
under the moon

372
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:16,709
And it's the same as the
emotion that I get from you

373
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,915
You got the kind of loving
that...

374
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,036
What's wrong with her?

375
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,213
Give me your heart...
‐ Mai.

376
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,261
‐  Make it real
or else forget‐‐

377
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,255
‐ What's wrong with you?
They want to know.

378
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,394
‐ Nothing.

379
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:33,056
It's just my high school
boyfriend said,

380
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,635
"Every time you hear this song,
I want you to think

381
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,931
"about me breaking up with you

382
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,944
'cause that's what
I'm doing right now."

383
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,516
So now, I keep listening
to this song

384
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,861
over and over again

385
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,525
and keep thinking
about how he broke up with me.

386
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,485
So it's just a cycle
of listening to this song

387
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,565
until I can get
the him breaking up with me

388
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,410
out of my head,
so I just gotta keep listening

389
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,196
to this song till it's done.

390
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,580
‐ You know
what this guy sounds like?

391
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,158
He sounds like a straight‐up...

392
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,254
Lo‐ser.

393
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,290
Look at me.

394
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,087
Hello there!

395
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,720
‐ It's, like, not even
how you do it.

396
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,177
‐ Lo...ser!

397
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,807
Loser!

398
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,635
Yeah, you're‐‐she's much
better at it than me.

399
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,101
‐ I'm not.

400
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,601
So this guy is your boyfriend's
best friend?

401
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,402
‐ Yeah. Why?

402
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,819
You know the saying, right?

403
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,237
"You are what you eat."

404
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,945
And Steve is eating
Derrick's asshole, so to speak.

405
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,486
So if you just‐‐
if you draw the connection‐‐

406
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,871
So you're saying
they're both shitty?

407
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,248
‐ I mean, kind of.

408
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,075
Okay, genius,
thank you so much.

409
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,370
You don't know him.

410
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,794
Steve isn't Derrick, like‐‐

411
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,462
‐ Well, picked real winners.

412
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,665
Maya. Maya!

413
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,764
Do you want to, like,
egg this fucker's house

414
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,013
after school?

415
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,686
‐ Okay.

416
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,859
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah.

417
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:12,278
‐ Okay?
‐ Yeah.

418
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,569
Let's do it. Yeah.

419
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,703
Yeah!

420
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,119
What's up, player?

421
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,657
- So you're not coming?
- That was trash.

422
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,910
I mean, he only did
the most jacked up thing

423
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,543
to my best friend.

424
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,829
Like, he's your friend.

425
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,803
And he's screwing over
my friend.

426
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,125
I mean, they just don't jive.

427
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,420
She didn't respect his music.

428
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,974
I don't know.
‐ Oh, my God.

429
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:38,137
That is not an excuse.
He's a psycho.

430
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,178
‐ It wasn't cool.
‐ Yeah, it wasn't.

431
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,182
‐ What else do you want
me to say?

432
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,643
‐ Well, you're‐‐
it wasn't cool.

433
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,694
It was dishonorable
what he did.

434
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,767
But it'd be dishonorable
for a best friend to‐‐

435
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,653
‐ Okay, so you're not coming?

436
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,275
‐ I'm not gonna egg
my best friend's house, Anna.

437
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,992
‐ Okay, you chose sides.

438
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,453
‐ "I'm not in this world
to live up

439
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,333
"to your expectations,
and you're not in this world

440
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,500
to live up to mine."

441
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,168
‐ Not everything is a saying.

442
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,416
Like, it's kind of a cop out.

443
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,588
And you chose sides,
and it's not mine,

444
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,968
so I'm not choosing yours.

445
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
I don't want to go out
with you anymore.

446
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,941
‐ Anna...

447
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,164
You've made your choice.
I respect it.

448
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,510
And I went to the bathroom

449
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,005
and I was‐‐and as I was walking
into the stall,

450
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,338
it was just like a needle.

451
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,262
Nah, he's not coming?

452
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,471
‐ No.

453
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,471
‐ What happened?

454
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,774
‐ Um, we just broke up.

455
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,308
‐ What?

456
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,613
Oh, my God.

457
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,066
- Are you okay?
- Sorry, Anna. That sucks.

458
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,276
Sorry, that's sucks.

459
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,646
What happened?

460
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,033
‐ Nothing.

461
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,871
Let's go egg this bitch.

462
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:22,867
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay?

463
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:23,948
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay.

464
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,122
‐ Let's just, like‐‐
‐ Do it.

465
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,001
‐ All right.
‐ Let's go!

466
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,078
‐ Let's go!
‐ All right.

467
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,082
Yeah!

468
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,550
Okay, stop!

469
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,796
‐ Do it.
‐ Okay, okay!

470
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,337
Shh!

471
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,681
Come on, come on, come on.

472
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,755
Okay.

473
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,891
Wait, what is this?

474
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:43,968
‐ Ew, oh, my God.
‐ Is this baby squid?

475
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,182
Are you kidding me, Maya?

476
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,892
Ew!
‐ It was all my mom had.

477
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,442
- That's what smells.
- What?

478
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,435
- It's stinky!
- But why?

479
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,057
‐ It's fine.
‐ It's jiggling.

480
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,364
‐ Wait, what?
‐ Don't touch me with that.

481
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,727
‐ Oh, shit.

482
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,983
Oh, my God,
I touched its tentacle.

483
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,324
Oh, no! No!

484
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,490
Dude, actually this is bad.

485
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,658
Look at all the ink.
Dude, do it.

486
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,066
‐ Ew!
‐ Shut up,

487
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,624
‐ That's gonna get
all over Derrick's window.

488
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,828
- You do it.
- You do it!

489
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,157
- You do it.
- Just throw it!

490
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,293
‐ Go, go!

491
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,003
Oh, my God.

492
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,130
- Oh!
- Yeah, eat squid!

493
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,222
- Okay.
- Ew, ew!

494
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,004
Run!

495
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,382
- Stop.
- Hey, scatter everyone.

496
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,129
Scatter! Go, go, go!

497
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,221
Oh, shit, my backpack!

498
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,546
- Go, go, go!
- Hey!

499
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,641
Yeah, wait up!

500
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,095
- Hey!
- Bitch!

501
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,675
- Fuck you!
- Hey!

502
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,891
Oh, my God.

503
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,687
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh. Can I sit here?

504
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,308
Oh, my God.

505
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,944
Oh, my God! Go, go, go!

506
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,743
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit!

507
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,531
‐ Shh! Shh!
‐ Is she still there?

508
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,334
‐ Fuck you!
‐ Shut up!

509
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,834
- Fuck you!
- Shh.

510
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,551
Bitch.

511
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:42,415
‐ How long should we wait?
‐ I don't know.

512
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,724
How long should we wait?

513
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,297
‐ I don't know,
that's why I asked you.

514
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,722
‐ Okay.

515
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,311
Sorry, I'm just thinking
about Steve.

516
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,637
He's just, like, not at all
who I thought he was.

517
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,983
And, like‐‐

518
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,898
‐ Dude, you deserve
way better than that scrub.

519
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,189
Trust me.

520
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,570
‐ I don't feel like that
right now.

521
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,292
‐ You have a little bit
of grass in your hair.

522
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,655
‐ Thank you.
‐ Anytime.

523
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,801
‐ Sometimes Steve did that.
He would take‐‐

524
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,165
‐ You want to see
something cool?

525
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,255
‐ Yeah.
‐ All right, check this out.

526
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,756
‐ You have grass
on your butt.

527
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:30,933
Ready?

528
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,252
Oh, my God. Look at your knees.

529
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,591
Shit.

530
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,875
My mom's gonna kill me.

531
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,668
This looks so stupid.

532
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:09,093
- Where did everyone go?
- I don't know.

533
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,264
I hope they didn't get caught.

534
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,473
Yeah.

535
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,233
How long do you think
we should stay back here?

536
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,096
‐ At least, like,
30 minutes or so.

537
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,444
30 minutes?

538
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,068
- Something like that.
- No.

539
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,396
‐ I don't know.
‐ That's too long.

540
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,584
What?

541
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,656
What?

542
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,834
‐ You know you're pretty,
right?

543
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,210
‐ No, I'm not, stupid.
Don't say that.

544
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,894
I'm butt ugly. It's fine.

545
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,545
No, you're not.

546
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,894
You're not butt ugly at all.

547
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,937
‐ Are you joking?

548
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,902
Not today.

549
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,397
Can I see your Discman?

550
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,032
‐ Why?

551
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:14,121
‐ I don't know.
I just want to try something.

552
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,827
‐ Okay, just be careful
with it.

553
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,037
Okay. Need help?

554
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,750
So whenever you hear
this song...

555
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,256
I want you to think of this.

556
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,513
If it's okay.

557
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,556
‐ All right. Okay.

558
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,519
It's okay.
‐ It's okay?

559
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,769
‐ Yeah.
‐ All right.

560
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:50,361
And if you said
this life ain't good enough

561
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:54,412
I would give my world
to lift you up

562
00:33:54,407 --> 00:34:00,117
I could change my live
to better suit your mood

563
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,291
Because you're so smooth

564
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:11,384
And it's just like the ocean
under the moon

565
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:15,803
It's the same as the emotion
that I get from you

566
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:20,104
You got the kind of loving
that can be so smooth, yeah

567
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,520
Give me your heart,
make it real

568
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,349
Or else forget about it

569
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,841
So cute.

570
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,206
Look at my cheeks,
they're so fat.

571
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,552
- Look at your face.
- You're like...

572
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:59,005
Oh, no, you're so little.

573
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,144
You were so cute.

574
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,391
‐ You're so cute.

575
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,023
‐ Oh, my God, look.
There I am.

576
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,480
- So stupid.
- Oh, little baby Maya.

577
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,185
Oh, my God.

578
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,401
I wonder what we'll be like
in the future.

579
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,902
‐ I know.

580
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,244
All I know is, I want my hair
to be, like, super, super long.

581
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,741
‐ Yeah?
‐ Like, to my ass.

582
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:21,754
‐ You will.

583
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,075
Yeah.

584
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,461
I can't believe
it's gonna be, like,

585
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,078
eighth grade, and then high
school, and then college.

586
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,254
And, like...

587
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,673
‐ Yeah, it's crazy.

588
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,052
‐ Do you think that
there's ever a time

589
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,589
that we won't be friends?

590
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,305
‐ Nah.
Why would you say that?

591
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:45,346
‐ No, I'm just saying,
'cause things happen, like‐‐

592
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,852
‐ Like what things?

593
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:54,901
‐ Like, what if after college,
you get a little bit depressed,

594
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,533
and I'm a little irresponsible,

595
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,870
and we're both
just so super dependent

596
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,616
on each other,
and I can't take it anymore.

597
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,749
And we don't laugh
like we used to?

598
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,918
‐ Or, like, the things
that we didn't think

599
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,839
would bother us
about each other.

600
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,257
Or our parents.

601
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,046
Or the way we see the world
starts to eat at us,

602
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:21,891
and we just get, like,
really cynical.

603
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,058
And really just, like,
wake up one day

604
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,927
and we're not friends.

605
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,113
Or...

606
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,163
‐ We share a dorm...
‐ Mm‐hmm.

607
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,406
‐ After school.
‐ Yes.

608
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,488
‐ Okay?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

609
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,662
‐ And I cook you
all of your lunches.

610
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,201
‐ Oh, yeah.
And I cook breakfast,

611
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,504
- dinners, and snacks.
- Yeah.

612
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,867
'Cause you're the only one
who knows how I like

613
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,383
my onions to be cooked.

614
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,705
‐ I knew you were gonna
say onions.

615
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,170
Sautéed.

616
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,839
‐ Sautéed! That's it.

617
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,720
‐ I know.
‐ Literally.

618
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,217
And, like, after work,
when we're older,

619
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,599
we're probably gonna, like,
walk together, like, every day.

620
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,926
‐ Yeah, and we're gonna
have a double wedding.

621
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,391
‐ Yeah.

622
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,641
And then we'll probably get
divorced at the same time.

623
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,773
‐ 'Cause they got in the way
of us.

624
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,059
‐ Yeah, and then
we'll probably have kids,

625
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,613
like, a couple years apart,

626
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,856
so that you can help me
raise mine.

627
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,648
'Cause I'm gonna have
issues with it.

628
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,361
‐ And we can live
on the same property, right?

629
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,821
‐ Yeah.

630
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,741
And then when you get sick,

631
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,531
I'm gonna take you
to the doctor every day

632
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,044
because it's a block away,
okay?

633
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,157
I'm gonna take you.

634
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,502
I will.

635
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,843
‐ We're just gonna protect
each other from everything.

636
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,299
‐ You promise?

637
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,220
‐ And then there are
gonna be clouds

638
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,888
that are, like,
a little lower in the sky,

639
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,677
like, just around our house.
‐ Yeah.

640
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,520
‐ And they're gonna be
really, really soft

641
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,765
so we can just, like,
hang out in them

642
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,348
and do, like, whatever,
you know?

643
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,352
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

644
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,193
‐ And then, like,
I'm gonna, like,

645
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,149
have the angels come down
every Friday,

646
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,439
and they're gonna be, like,

647
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,862
"Hey, do you guys, like,
want anything?"

648
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,110
And we're gonna be, like, "No."

649
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,572
'Cause we have each other.

650
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,495
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God, look!

651
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,960
That's when we met.
