01:21.748 --> 01:23.958
Oh, is‐‐is your mom not home?

01:23.959 --> 01:26.249
Nah, she's never home.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.133
You guys wanna go in first?

01:29.506 --> 01:31.796
Cool.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.181
‐ Is it okay to just‐‐

02:20.307 --> 02:21.847
Put Daddy...

02:26.480 --> 02:27.900
I'm gonna take my jacket off.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.728
‐ What?
‐ I'm gonna take my jacket off.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.903
‐ Okay.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.777
So what should we do?

02:37.449 --> 02:38.989
‐ Whatever.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.622
Okay.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.368
‐ Do you have
any snacks, babe?

02:45.374 --> 02:48.254
Yeah, they're in the freezer
over there.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.421
‐ Over...

02:49.419 --> 02:52.089
Over there. Through the door.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.549
‐ Look here, um‐‐
‐ What chord was that?

02:56.551 --> 02:57.801
- Which one?
- See you.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.643
Just kidding.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.928
JK.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.435
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Totally.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.056
‐ Oh, my God.
Is this what I look like?

03:08.063 --> 03:09.523
‐ You look amazing.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.903
I am so hungry, though. Like‐‐

03:10.899 --> 03:11.979
‐ Oh, my God.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.033
Wait, look at this freezer.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.237
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

03:16.238 --> 03:17.358
‐ I'm so‐‐

03:17.364 --> 03:18.824
Wait, are those marshmallows?

03:18.824 --> 03:21.284
- Okay.
- Here.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.794
Oh, my God.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.326
I'm so hungry.

03:26.957 --> 03:27.957
You don't want
to go home, right?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.958
Like, you're not worried
at all?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.590
‐ Mm‐mm. I'm not worried.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.047
Unless you want to‐‐

03:34.047 --> 03:36.627
Do you want to go home
or do you want to stay?

03:36.633 --> 03:39.013
‐ I want to hang out
with our boyfriends.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.600
‐ Okay, yeah.
I don't want to go home.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.676
‐ You're, like, gonna get
your first kiss.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.142
‐ No, I'm not, stop.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.522
Oh, stop!

03:46.518 --> 03:48.348
I don't know.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.863
Is my breath okay?

03:50.856 --> 03:52.436
‐ No, it smells amazing.
How's mine?

03:56.445 --> 03:58.485
I'm sorry, it's not good.
‐ Oh, Maya.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.368
‐ Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
‐ No.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.615
Here we go.

04:05.662 --> 04:06.752
This song's awesome, man.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.616
Heck yeah.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.214
Let me do it.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.879
Cool. Cool. Cool.

04:16.506 --> 04:17.716
‐ Don't touch my butt.
‐ I didn't.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.891
‐ Wait, would you play
that chord again?

04:21.887 --> 04:23.467
This one right here?

04:23.472 --> 04:25.102
‐ Yeah.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.518
Very good. Cool. Cool.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.271
‐ Could you cut out
the drumming?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.654
We're trying to hit this.
You're throwing me off.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.491
‐ I think that your drumming
sounds good.

04:38.487 --> 04:43.067
Yeah, it's just not
matchin' up with our rhythm.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.374
‐ Steve, her dad's
a professional drummer.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.038
So...
‐ Oh, stop.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.497
‐ He is, though.
You shouldn't be humble.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.247
‐ I'm not.
‐ Excellent! Get up.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.538
Okay, I'm sorry.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.751
Get up, get up, go!

04:55.962 --> 04:58.722
One, two, three.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.925
Cool, cool, cool.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.507
Excellent! Cool.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.722
Sorry.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.732
- Are you being bad?
- Sorry.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.806
‐ You want to check out
my watch?

05:12.813 --> 05:13.943
‐ Yeah.

05:18.109 --> 05:22.989
- Ooh!
- Stop.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.199
‐ You look good. Sorry.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.453
I'm cold.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.873
Thanks, Steve.

05:30.872 --> 05:34.172
‐ Yeah.
‐ What kind is it?

05:34.167 --> 05:37.997
‐ Eh, some kind of army.
It's got the army paint on it.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.640
What are you doing?

05:51.643 --> 05:53.693
I'm just‐‐'cause I'm cold.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.727
We're both cold.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.233
Okay.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.598
‐ You want to go
to my room?

06:32.475 --> 06:33.555
‐ Okay.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.378
‐ Sorry, can we just do
over the shirt?

07:41.378 --> 07:43.508
‐ Huh?
‐ Can we just do over it?

07:47.634 --> 07:50.144
Do you like it
without my braces?

07:50.136 --> 07:53.216
‐ I like it.
Less cuts.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.606
‐ Who's that?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.317
That's Gillian Anderson.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.397
‐ No, below that.

08:06.403 --> 08:07.453
- Oh.
- Is that, like,

08:07.445 --> 08:09.105
your ex‐girlfriend or whatever?

08:09.114 --> 08:10.284
- I'm not mad.
- No, no.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.701
That's my friend.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.501
I don't think about her.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.785
Did you bring your meds?

08:18.289 --> 08:22.459
‐ Um, no, they don't
really work for me.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.670
Sorry. Is that okay?

08:25.672 --> 08:27.222
‐ I guess.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.727
‐ Is this your first time?

08:47.235 --> 08:50.445
‐ Yeah. Is it yours?

08:50.447 --> 08:52.487
‐ No. I've done it a lot.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.830
Like, a couple times.
‐ Yeah.

08:54.826 --> 08:55.826
‐ Yeah.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.963
‐ You mean, a BJ right?

09:04.627 --> 09:07.627
You've had
your first kiss before.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.760
‐ Y‐‐uh. Yeah, obviously.

09:10.759 --> 09:14.599
Like, I've had
a bunch of first kisses.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.388
‐ Cool.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.109
‐ I'm ready.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.908
‐ Oh, sorry.
‐ That's all right.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.105
Let me just‐‐
‐ Keep going.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.164
‐ Okay.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.453
‐ Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.544
‐ Come on.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.170
No.

09:45.627 --> 09:46.957
You think Maya's
a good drummer, right?

09:49.005 --> 09:50.165
‐ I mean, I guess.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.342
‐ Well, You didn't have
her back back there,

09:53.343 --> 09:55.683
and you didn't have, like,
her dad's back,

09:55.678 --> 09:57.178
'cause you only had
Derrick's back.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.970
And it's, like,
who's back do you have?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.064
‐ I love you.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.400
‐ Don't change the subject.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.691
‐ Say it back.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.152
Say it.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.735
‐ I love you too.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.259
Come on, let's take it off.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.378
‐ Get it‐‐
‐ Ahh.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.184
Actually, get this.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.177
Okay.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.271
Do you want to‐‐you could‐‐

10:53.778 --> 10:54.858
‐ Whoa.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.752
What's wrong with your balls?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.286
‐ What do you mean?

11:05.290 --> 11:07.880
‐ Why don't you have
two balls?

11:07.876 --> 11:09.246
‐ What?

11:09.252 --> 11:12.512
Oh, there are two,
it's just they're inside.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.795
It's not like there's a‐‐

11:13.798 --> 11:17.638
‐ Oh, so it's like
the line is‐‐

11:17.635 --> 11:19.925
‐ The line? What line?

11:19.929 --> 11:23.729
‐ The line‐‐it's like
it has its own carrying case.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.265
‐ Yeah. I guess.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.809
Do you want to stop
talking about it?

11:27.812 --> 11:29.152
‐ Yeah. Sorry.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.437
Yeah.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.570
- Okay.
- So I'm gonna start now.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.664
Uh...

11:52.629 --> 11:54.839
‐ What's wrong?

11:54.839 --> 11:56.339
‐ I finished.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.301
‐ I didn't cum.
‐ Oh.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.222
‐ Yeah, that's not‐‐
‐ Yeah?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.221
‐ That's an important part,
right?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.602
‐ Okay, I'm gonna do it.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.598
Okay.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.572
‐ Ah, ah! Teeth, teeth!

12:17.570 --> 12:19.410
‐ Ah, sorry.
‐ Yeah, they're‐‐

12:19.405 --> 12:21.115
They're just kind of, like,
dragging.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.235
‐ Okay.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.919
‐ Like that?
‐ Mm.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.259
Like that?

13:06.202 --> 13:09.872
Mm‐hmm.

13:10.873 --> 13:15.843
Mm.

13:26.848 --> 13:27.888
Thanks.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.774
Do you want to kiss?

13:36.983 --> 13:39.493
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.985
Oh.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.607
‐ But, I'm gonna be‐‐

13:52.874 --> 13:54.004
Maya?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.090
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.245
I'm still‐‐
‐ Maya?

14:01.716 --> 14:05.886
- Ew. Ew, ew, ew, ew.
- Are you okay?

14:05.887 --> 14:06.927
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

14:06.929 --> 14:07.929
‐ Did you just get
your first kiss?

14:07.930 --> 14:09.350
Mine was so disgusting.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.518
Like, I got mine with Brendan,
you know I hated it.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.687
And now, like, Steve is, like‐‐
We have it perfectly down.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.767
So kissing's just like that.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.943
Maya, are you okay?

14:20.943 --> 14:23.033
‐ I just gave him
a blow job.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.124
‐ You got your kiss
and you got a blow job.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.327
‐ I didn't do‐‐I just‐‐

14:34.332 --> 14:35.922
‐ Oh.
‐ I just, like‐‐

14:37.919 --> 14:39.089
‐ Amazing.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.667
‐ Yeah. Is it?

14:41.672 --> 14:43.632
Yeah.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.763
But, what was it like?
Did you like it?

14:44.759 --> 14:46.639
Did he like it?
‐ Um, I don't know.

14:46.636 --> 14:51.386
I, like, think he did,
'cause he just, like‐‐

14:51.390 --> 14:53.810
it was, like, weird,
and then he, like, came.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.230
‐ Oh, my God,
are you serious?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.309
‐ Yeah.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.364
‐ Wow. So cool.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.779
‐ I know.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.067
And you were, like‐‐

15:04.070 --> 15:06.990
You were, like,
"Wow, yeah. You're amazing."

15:06.989 --> 15:09.829
‐ I don't think I want
to do a blow job again, though.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.656
‐ Oh, yeah. Yeah.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.411
‐ I probably am not gonna ever.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.712
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.955
'Cause it was, like, gross

15:15.957 --> 15:17.457
'cause of the, like‐‐
like, the‐‐

15:17.458 --> 15:19.418
‐ Can we just, like, go home?
‐ Oh, yeah.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.878
- Yeah, we can go home.
- Okay.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.208
‐ Steve, can you drive us home?
‐ Shh!

15:24.132 --> 15:26.932
‐ Let's‐‐let's call Shuji.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.756
Let's call Shuji.
‐ Okay.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.801
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

15:29.804 --> 15:30.974
‐ Okay!

15:30.972 --> 15:32.312
‐ Steve?

15:33.975 --> 15:37.515
Steve! Steven?

16:37.955 --> 16:39.535
Is everything okay?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.540
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Yeah.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.001
‐ It's fine.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.168
‐ All right.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.801
‐ That's him.
‐ Who's that?

16:50.801 --> 16:52.601
‐ It's my brother.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.064
Hi, Shuji.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.059
I don't want to know
what happened.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.851
Okay, I'm sorry.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.404
You guys take the bike, okay?

17:03.397 --> 17:05.317
- Okay.
- Thank you.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.686
Um, let's just‐‐yeah.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.192
- I got it.
- Okay.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.784
Here, I got you. I got it.

17:10.780 --> 17:11.780
‐ I love you.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.874
‐ Love you too.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.789
‐ Do you have that?
‐ Yeah.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.457
‐ Go.
‐ Peace.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.949
Just do Saturday,

17:58.953 --> 18:00.713
then you can just come
and get her.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.495
And then she can sleep in
Friday and‐‐

18:03.499 --> 18:04.999
no.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.591
No!

18:06.586 --> 18:10.166
I'll just leave her stuff out
by the front door.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.302
Otherwise, you pick her up
Saturday.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.890
Like, let her sleep in, though.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.925
You know, till 2:00.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.100
Hi, hon.
‐ Hey.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.689
Or you pick her up from school

18:22.685 --> 18:25.265
and then you get her stuff,
and then you go.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.481
Um. Okay.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.571
Whatever.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.397
Um, how was Maya's?

18:32.403 --> 18:33.703
You didn't sleep over?

18:36.907 --> 18:38.367
I was just talking to your dad

18:38.367 --> 18:41.747
about you going over
to his this weekend.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.495
Anna's home.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.916
Okay. He wants to talk to you.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.431
‐ Hey, Dad.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.216
‐ How's it going, goof?

18:57.219 --> 18:58.429
You still mad at us?

19:00.431 --> 19:04.641
‐ Um, I just, like,
have some bad news actually,

19:04.644 --> 19:06.904
'cause, um,

19:06.896 --> 19:11.566
a golden retriever
killed Daddy.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.647
And it's my fault.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.783
Don't say it's your fault.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.279
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.450
What‐‐what happened?

19:17.448 --> 19:19.448
Did the dog steal him?

19:19.450 --> 19:24.910
Um, I kind of put it
on the dog's head.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.544
And that's why it's my fault.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.790
- Sorry.
- Well.

19:28.793 --> 19:32.253
Just, you know,
maybe don't do that again.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.554
All right?
You gotta learn from it.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.888
But the dog was wrong, too,
right?

19:37.885 --> 19:41.305
‐ Yeah, the dog was wrong too.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.305
Yeah.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.886
‐ And also, like...

19:45.893 --> 19:47.603
I love Steve.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.653
‐ Aw.
‐ Really?

19:48.646 --> 19:52.016
‐ Um, mom.
‐ What?

19:52.024 --> 19:53.484
But I also don't know
about him.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.904
‐ Well, what'd your mom say?

19:55.903 --> 19:57.283
‐ Um.
‐ Here.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.489
Put her on speaker phone.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.280
Kathy?

20:01.283 --> 20:02.453
She loves him.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.371
‐ I didn't know.
She didn't tell me.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.160
‐ But I don't know
'cause he doesn't, like,

20:06.163 --> 20:08.003
always listen to my feelings,

20:07.998 --> 20:11.038
and I don't know
about his best friend.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.923
He just doesn't take me
seriously.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.511
‐ Well, I don't like that.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.336
But I also want to marry him.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.138
It's not funny.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.887
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ Don't laugh, Dad.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.138
‐ I'm not laughing.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.390
Just fix it.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.521
‐ Oh, sweetie.

20:27.518 --> 20:30.148
We can't fix everything,
you know that.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.606
But we can listen, okay?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.399
‐ Okay.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.622
Dad?

20:42.616 --> 20:46.076
What are you doing?
‐ Vacuuming.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.038
Oh, hey, I got the plastic
off the oven.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.209
‐ Proud of you, Dad.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.165
Derrick!

21:31.165 --> 21:32.825
Yeah, my snake's been acting
real sweet lately.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.173
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

21:34.168 --> 21:35.418
‐ This is private.
‐ She's always taking

21:35.419 --> 21:36.629
her tongue out...
‐ Tell him.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.879
- Tell him.
- And licking me.

21:37.880 --> 21:38.880
I know she's just smelling,
but‐‐

21:38.881 --> 21:40.011
‐ When are you gonna tell him?

21:40.007 --> 21:42.177
- Um, wait.
- Huh?

21:42.176 --> 21:46.386
‐ Okay, it's been 21 minutes
of us talking on the phone.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.888
I feel like that's
our longest yet, babe.

21:48.891 --> 21:51.021
Derrick:
Yeah. Oh, hold up.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.478
I gotta grab‐‐I gotta go grab

21:52.478 --> 21:53.938
the snake something...
‐ Oh, okay‐‐

21:53.938 --> 21:55.228
Then I gotta
tell you something.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.731
‐ Okay.
Okay, what? He's on hold.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.073
‐ Okay, so you're gonna say,

21:59.068 --> 22:00.738
"If you still want
to go out with me,

22:00.736 --> 22:02.066
I can't give you another BJ."

22:02.071 --> 22:03.531
‐ I want to go out
with him.

22:03.531 --> 22:05.411
I just don't want
to give him a BJ again.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.407
‐ And medicine 'cause
my doctor prescribed it.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.369
‐ Shh!
Anna, I already told him

22:09.370 --> 22:10.370
that part yesterday.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.871
‐ Okay!
‐ Okay.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.083
Wait, nah. Open your mouth.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.094
‐ What?
‐ Your tooth.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.496
‐ What?
What's wrong with my tooth?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.014
‐ Oh, my God!

22:20.005 --> 22:22.215
What happened?
‐ No, I just got my braces off!

22:22.216 --> 22:24.836
‐ It looks crazy.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.054
No!

22:27.054 --> 22:28.064
Anna.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.385
No, no, no.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.180
This is why I got braces!
Are you kidding me?

22:32.184 --> 22:34.404
‐ I mean, honestly,
I like you better that way.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.805
‐ With a snaggle?

22:35.813 --> 22:37.653
I'm gonna have to get
my braces back on.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.398
You still there?

22:39.400 --> 22:40.860
‐ Hi, yeah.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.900
Turn on the radio
to HOT 106.7.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.073
‐ What‐‐okay, um.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.492
Anna. Anna!

22:46.490 --> 22:49.700
He just said put the radio on.
Put it on‐‐on 106.7.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.792
‐ Did he get you
concert tickets?

22:50.786 --> 22:51.906
‐ I don't know!

22:51.912 --> 22:53.962
‐ Did he get us
concert tickets?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.958
Got it.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.053
‐ Okay, it's on, it's on.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.416
I freaking love this song.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.673
- You listening?
- Yeah.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.094
I'm listening.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.182
Good.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.136
Every time you hear this song,

23:08.137 --> 23:11.177
think about how
I'm breaking up with you.

23:11.181 --> 23:14.141
'Cause that's
what I'm doing right now.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.313
Man it's a hot one

23:17.313 --> 23:21.443
Like seven inches
from the midday sun

23:21.442 --> 23:26.412
Well, I hear you whisper
and the words melt everyone

23:26.405 --> 23:30.615
But you stay so cool

23:30.618 --> 23:35.118
And if you said
this life ain't good enough

23:35.122 --> 23:39.082
I would give my world
to lift you up

23:39.084 --> 23:41.714
I could change my life

23:41.712 --> 23:45.132
To better suit your mood

23:47.051 --> 23:50.101
'Cause you're so smooth

23:51.889 --> 23:56.099
And it's just like the ocean
under the moon

23:56.101 --> 24:00.481
It's the same as the emotion
that I get from you

24:00.481 --> 24:04.611
You the kind of loving
that can be so smooth, yeah

24:04.610 --> 24:07.150
Give me your heart,
make it real

24:07.154 --> 24:09.324
Or else forget about it

24:09.323 --> 24:12.413
It's just like the ocean
under the moon

24:12.409 --> 24:16.709
And it's the same as the
emotion that I get from you

24:16.705 --> 24:18.915
You got the kind of loving
that...

24:18.916 --> 24:21.036
What's wrong with her?

24:21.043 --> 24:22.213
Give me your heart...
‐ Mai.

24:22.211 --> 24:25.261
‐  Make it real
or else forget‐‐

24:25.255 --> 24:27.255
‐ What's wrong with you?
They want to know.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.394
‐ Nothing.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.056
It's just my high school
boyfriend said,

24:33.055 --> 24:35.635
"Every time you hear this song,
I want you to think

24:35.641 --> 24:36.931
"about me breaking up with you

24:36.934 --> 24:38.944
'cause that's what
I'm doing right now."

24:38.936 --> 24:40.516
So now, I keep listening
to this song

24:40.521 --> 24:41.861
over and over again

24:41.855 --> 24:44.525
and keep thinking
about how he broke up with me.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.485
So it's just a cycle
of listening to this song

24:46.485 --> 24:48.565
until I can get
the him breaking up with me

24:48.570 --> 24:50.410
out of my head,
so I just gotta keep listening

24:50.406 --> 24:52.196
to this song till it's done.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.580
‐ You know
what this guy sounds like?

24:56.578 --> 24:59.158
He sounds like a straight‐up...

24:59.164 --> 25:01.254
Lo‐ser.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.290
Look at me.

25:05.087 --> 25:06.087
Hello there!

25:08.090 --> 25:09.720
‐ It's, like, not even
how you do it.

25:09.717 --> 25:12.177
‐ Lo...ser!

25:12.177 --> 25:14.807
Loser!

25:14.805 --> 25:17.635
Yeah, you're‐‐she's much
better at it than me.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.101
‐ I'm not.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.601
So this guy is your boyfriend's
best friend?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.402
‐ Yeah. Why?

25:25.399 --> 25:26.819
You know the saying, right?

25:26.817 --> 25:28.237
"You are what you eat."

25:28.235 --> 25:30.945
And Steve is eating
Derrick's asshole, so to speak.

25:30.946 --> 25:34.486
So if you just‐‐
if you draw the connection‐‐

25:34.491 --> 25:35.871
So you're saying
they're both shitty?

25:35.868 --> 25:38.248
‐ I mean, kind of.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.075
Okay, genius,
thank you so much.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.370
You don't know him.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.794
Steve isn't Derrick, like‐‐

25:43.792 --> 25:45.462
‐ Well, picked real winners.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.665
Maya. Maya!

25:54.344 --> 25:55.764
Do you want to, like,
egg this fucker's house

25:55.763 --> 25:57.013
after school?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.686
‐ Okay.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.859
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah.

26:07.858 --> 26:12.278
‐ Okay?
‐ Yeah.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.569
Let's do it. Yeah.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.703
Yeah!

26:15.699 --> 26:17.119
What's up, player?

26:17.117 --> 26:18.657
- So you're not coming?
- That was trash.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.910
I mean, he only did
the most jacked up thing

26:20.913 --> 26:22.543
to my best friend.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.829
Like, he's your friend.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.803
And he's screwing over
my friend.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.125
I mean, they just don't jive.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.420
She didn't respect his music.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.974
I don't know.
‐ Oh, my God.

26:33.967 --> 26:38.137
That is not an excuse.
He's a psycho.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.178
‐ It wasn't cool.
‐ Yeah, it wasn't.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.182
‐ What else do you want
me to say?

26:41.183 --> 26:43.643
‐ Well, you're‐‐
it wasn't cool.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.694
It was dishonorable
what he did.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.767
But it'd be dishonorable
for a best friend to‐‐

26:47.773 --> 26:49.653
‐ Okay, so you're not coming?

26:51.735 --> 26:54.275
‐ I'm not gonna egg
my best friend's house, Anna.

26:58.242 --> 26:59.992
‐ Okay, you chose sides.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.453
‐ "I'm not in this world
to live up

27:01.453 --> 27:03.333
"to your expectations,
and you're not in this world

27:03.330 --> 27:04.500
to live up to mine."

27:04.498 --> 27:06.168
‐ Not everything is a saying.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.416
Like, it's kind of a cop out.

27:08.418 --> 27:11.588
And you chose sides,
and it's not mine,

27:11.588 --> 27:13.968
so I'm not choosing yours.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.560
I don't want to go out
with you anymore.

27:30.691 --> 27:31.941
‐ Anna...

27:35.404 --> 27:38.164
You've made your choice.
I respect it.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.510
And I went to the bathroom

27:53.505 --> 27:56.005
and I was‐‐and as I was walking
into the stall,

27:56.008 --> 27:57.338
it was just like a needle.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.262
Nah, he's not coming?

27:59.261 --> 28:01.471
‐ No.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.471
‐ What happened?

28:04.224 --> 28:06.774
‐ Um, we just broke up.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.308
‐ What?

28:09.313 --> 28:10.613
Oh, my God.

28:10.606 --> 28:13.066
- Are you okay?
- Sorry, Anna. That sucks.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.276
Sorry, that's sucks.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.646
What happened?

28:17.613 --> 28:19.033
‐ Nothing.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.871
Let's go egg this bitch.

28:21.867 --> 28:22.867
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay?

28:22.868 --> 28:23.948
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.122
‐ Let's just, like‐‐
‐ Do it.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.001
‐ All right.
‐ Let's go!

28:27.998 --> 28:29.078
‐ Let's go!
‐ All right.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.082
Yeah!

28:31.960 --> 28:34.550
Okay, stop!

28:34.546 --> 28:35.796
‐ Do it.
‐ Okay, okay!

28:35.797 --> 28:37.337
Shh!

28:37.341 --> 28:38.681
Come on, come on, come on.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.755
Okay.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.891
Wait, what is this?

28:42.888 --> 28:43.968
‐ Ew, oh, my God.
‐ Is this baby squid?

28:43.972 --> 28:45.182
Are you kidding me, Maya?

28:45.182 --> 28:46.892
Ew!
‐ It was all my mom had.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.442
- That's what smells.
- What?

28:48.435 --> 28:50.435
- It's stinky!
- But why?

28:50.437 --> 28:52.057
‐ It's fine.
‐ It's jiggling.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.364
‐ Wait, what?
‐ Don't touch me with that.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.727
‐ Oh, shit.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.983
Oh, my God,
I touched its tentacle.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.324
Oh, no! No!

28:58.320 --> 28:59.490
Dude, actually this is bad.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.658
Look at all the ink.
Dude, do it.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.066
‐ Ew!
‐ Shut up,

29:02.074 --> 29:04.624
‐ That's gonna get
all over Derrick's window.

29:04.618 --> 29:05.828
- You do it.
- You do it!

29:05.827 --> 29:08.157
- You do it.
- Just throw it!

29:08.163 --> 29:09.293
‐ Go, go!

29:12.793 --> 29:14.003
Oh, my God.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.130
- Oh!
- Yeah, eat squid!

29:19.132 --> 29:21.222
- Okay.
- Ew, ew!

29:53.834 --> 29:55.004
Run!

29:55.002 --> 29:57.382
- Stop.
- Hey, scatter everyone.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.129
Scatter! Go, go, go!

29:59.131 --> 30:01.221
Oh, shit, my backpack!

30:01.216 --> 30:02.546
- Go, go, go!
- Hey!

30:02.551 --> 30:03.641
Yeah, wait up!

30:03.635 --> 30:05.095
- Hey!
- Bitch!

30:05.095 --> 30:07.675
- Fuck you!
- Hey!

30:07.681 --> 30:08.891
Oh, my God.

30:10.767 --> 30:14.687
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh. Can I sit here?

30:14.688 --> 30:16.308
Oh, my God.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.944
Oh, my God! Go, go, go!

30:19.943 --> 30:21.743
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit!

30:24.781 --> 30:27.531
‐ Shh! Shh!
‐ Is she still there?

30:27.534 --> 30:30.334
‐ Fuck you!
‐ Shut up!

30:32.414 --> 30:33.834
- Fuck you!
- Shh.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.551
Bitch.

30:38.545 --> 30:42.415
‐ How long should we wait?
‐ I don't know.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.724
How long should we wait?

30:43.717 --> 30:45.297
‐ I don't know,
that's why I asked you.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.722
‐ Okay.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.311
Sorry, I'm just thinking
about Steve.

30:50.307 --> 30:53.637
He's just, like, not at all
who I thought he was.

30:53.643 --> 30:54.983
And, like‐‐

30:54.978 --> 30:58.898
‐ Dude, you deserve
way better than that scrub.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.189
Trust me.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.570
‐ I don't feel like that
right now.

31:07.282 --> 31:10.292
‐ You have a little bit
of grass in your hair.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.655
‐ Thank you.
‐ Anytime.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.801
‐ Sometimes Steve did that.
He would take‐‐

31:19.795 --> 31:21.165
‐ You want to see
something cool?

31:23.465 --> 31:25.255
‐ Yeah.
‐ All right, check this out.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.756
‐ You have grass
on your butt.

31:29.763 --> 31:30.933
Ready?

31:57.082 --> 31:59.252
Oh, my God. Look at your knees.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.591
Shit.

32:00.585 --> 32:01.875
My mom's gonna kill me.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.668
This looks so stupid.

32:05.423 --> 32:09.093
- Where did everyone go?
- I don't know.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.264
I hope they didn't get caught.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.473
Yeah.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.233
How long do you think
we should stay back here?

32:16.226 --> 32:19.096
‐ At least, like,
30 minutes or so.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.444
30 minutes?

32:20.438 --> 32:23.068
- Something like that.
- No.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.396
‐ I don't know.
‐ That's too long.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.584
What?

32:32.576 --> 32:34.656
What?

32:37.414 --> 32:38.834
‐ You know you're pretty,
right?

32:42.210 --> 32:46.210
‐ No, I'm not, stupid.
Don't say that.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.894
I'm butt ugly. It's fine.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.545
No, you're not.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.894
You're not butt ugly at all.

32:57.767 --> 32:58.937
‐ Are you joking?

33:00.562 --> 33:01.902
Not today.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.397
Can I see your Discman?

33:09.112 --> 33:11.032
‐ Why?

33:11.031 --> 33:14.121
‐ I don't know.
I just want to try something.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.827
‐ Okay, just be careful
with it.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.037
Okay. Need help?

33:20.290 --> 33:24.750
So whenever you hear
this song...

33:26.796 --> 33:29.256
I want you to think of this.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.513
If it's okay.

33:36.306 --> 33:39.556
‐ All right. Okay.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.519
It's okay.
‐ It's okay?

33:41.519 --> 33:42.769
‐ Yeah.
‐ All right.

33:45.941 --> 33:50.361
And if you said
this life ain't good enough

33:50.362 --> 33:54.412
I would give my world
to lift you up

33:54.407 --> 34:00.117
I could change my live
to better suit your mood

34:02.791 --> 34:05.291
Because you're so smooth

34:07.254 --> 34:11.384
And it's just like the ocean
under the moon

34:11.383 --> 34:15.803
It's the same as the emotion
that I get from you

34:15.804 --> 34:20.104
You got the kind of loving
that can be so smooth, yeah

34:20.100 --> 34:22.520
Give me your heart,
make it real

34:22.519 --> 34:24.349
Or else forget about it

34:46.251 --> 34:47.841
So cute.

34:47.836 --> 34:49.206
Look at my cheeks,
they're so fat.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.552
- Look at your face.
- You're like...

34:55.135 --> 34:59.005
Oh, no, you're so little.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.144
You were so cute.

35:01.141 --> 35:03.391
‐ You're so cute.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.023
‐ Oh, my God, look.
There I am.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.480
- So stupid.
- Oh, little baby Maya.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.185
Oh, my God.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.401
I wonder what we'll be like
in the future.

35:12.402 --> 35:14.902
‐ I know.

35:14.904 --> 35:18.244
All I know is, I want my hair
to be, like, super, super long.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.741
‐ Yeah?
‐ Like, to my ass.

35:20.744 --> 35:21.754
‐ You will.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.075
Yeah.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.461
I can't believe
it's gonna be, like,

35:26.458 --> 35:28.078
eighth grade, and then high
school, and then college.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.254
And, like...

35:30.253 --> 35:32.673
‐ Yeah, it's crazy.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.052
‐ Do you think that
there's ever a time

35:34.049 --> 35:35.589
that we won't be friends?

35:37.135 --> 35:41.305
‐ Nah.
Why would you say that?

35:41.306 --> 35:45.346
‐ No, I'm just saying,
'cause things happen, like‐‐

35:45.352 --> 35:46.852
‐ Like what things?

35:48.521 --> 35:54.901
‐ Like, what if after college,
you get a little bit depressed,

35:54.903 --> 35:57.533
and I'm a little irresponsible,

35:57.530 --> 35:59.870
and we're both
just so super dependent

35:59.866 --> 36:02.616
on each other,
and I can't take it anymore.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.749
And we don't laugh
like we used to?

36:06.998 --> 36:10.918
‐ Or, like, the things
that we didn't think

36:10.919 --> 36:12.839
would bother us
about each other.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.257
Or our parents.

36:15.256 --> 36:18.046
Or the way we see the world
starts to eat at us,

36:18.051 --> 36:21.891
and we just get, like,
really cynical.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.058
And really just, like,
wake up one day

36:24.057 --> 36:25.927
and we're not friends.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.113
Or...

36:38.113 --> 36:40.163
‐ We share a dorm...
‐ Mm‐hmm.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.406
‐ After school.
‐ Yes.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.488
‐ Okay?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.662
‐ And I cook you
all of your lunches.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.201
‐ Oh, yeah.
And I cook breakfast,

36:46.204 --> 36:47.504
- dinners, and snacks.
- Yeah.

36:47.497 --> 36:48.867
'Cause you're the only one
who knows how I like

36:48.873 --> 36:50.383
my onions to be cooked.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.705
‐ I knew you were gonna
say onions.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.170
Sautéed.

36:53.169 --> 36:56.839
‐ Sautéed! That's it.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.720
‐ I know.
‐ Literally.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.217
And, like, after work,
when we're older,

37:01.219 --> 37:03.599
we're probably gonna, like,
walk together, like, every day.

37:03.596 --> 37:04.926
‐ Yeah, and we're gonna
have a double wedding.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.391
‐ Yeah.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.641
And then we'll probably get
divorced at the same time.

37:08.643 --> 37:09.773
‐ 'Cause they got in the way
of us.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.059
‐ Yeah, and then
we'll probably have kids,

37:12.063 --> 37:13.613
like, a couple years apart,

37:13.606 --> 37:14.856
so that you can help me
raise mine.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.648
'Cause I'm gonna have
issues with it.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.361
‐ And we can live
on the same property, right?

37:18.361 --> 37:19.821
‐ Yeah.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.741
And then when you get sick,

37:22.741 --> 37:24.531
I'm gonna take you
to the doctor every day

37:24.534 --> 37:26.044
because it's a block away,
okay?

37:27.537 --> 37:29.157
I'm gonna take you.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.502
I will.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.843
‐ We're just gonna protect
each other from everything.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.299
‐ You promise?

37:40.300 --> 37:42.220
‐ And then there are
gonna be clouds

37:42.218 --> 37:43.888
that are, like,
a little lower in the sky,

37:43.887 --> 37:45.677
like, just around our house.
‐ Yeah.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.520
‐ And they're gonna be
really, really soft

37:47.515 --> 37:49.765
so we can just, like,
hang out in them

37:49.768 --> 37:51.348
and do, like, whatever,
you know?

37:51.352 --> 37:52.352
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.193
‐ And then, like,
I'm gonna, like,

37:54.189 --> 37:56.149
have the angels come down
every Friday,

37:56.149 --> 37:57.439
and they're gonna be, like,

37:57.442 --> 37:58.862
"Hey, do you guys, like,
want anything?"

37:58.860 --> 38:01.110
And we're gonna be, like, "No."

38:01.112 --> 38:02.572
'Cause we have each other.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.495
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God, look!

38:13.500 --> 38:14.960
That's when we met.
