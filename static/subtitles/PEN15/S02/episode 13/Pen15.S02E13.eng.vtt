00:08.050 --> 00:09.970
It's weird D isn't here yet.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.548
He's coming. He is!

00:12.554 --> 00:14.854
I brought him
my Thursday pill, look.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.727
Hi. How are you?

00:18.727 --> 00:20.097
I'm your neighbor
from down the street.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.443
How are you?

00:21.438 --> 00:22.978
‐ Good. Is this
the wrapping paper project?

00:22.981 --> 00:24.571
Because I'm cooking something.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.316
I get all my gift wrapping at
the Christmas Tree shop, so...

00:27.319 --> 00:30.489
‐ This is for
the Walk for Cancer.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.869
‐ Yeah and it's through

00:31.865 --> 00:33.825
my Unitarian Church
in Conchamaguet.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.405
Um, we're just
selling luminaries.

00:35.410 --> 00:39.540
So if I can just have
another moment of your time.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.670
"You can choose a message
for your survivor

00:41.667 --> 00:43.837
"or beloved deceased
you want to remember.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.335
"We'll write it
for you on a bag."

00:45.337 --> 00:47.127
‐ No, no, I'm sorry.
No, thank you.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.505
‐ Bitch.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.553
Oh, my God.
‐ What are you doing?

00:52.552 --> 00:54.552
‐ I didn't think she heard.
‐ The door was so open.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.894
‐ Geez.
‐ Ha!

00:57.641 --> 00:59.101
‐ We know you're there.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.351
You've, like, done it
three times.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.862
‐ I keep forgetting.
‐ So stupid.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.275
‐ Stop. Don't do that.
‐ Did‐‐

01:06.275 --> 01:07.815
Did D answer yet?

01:07.818 --> 01:09.738
'Cause he said he was
going to be here at three.

01:10.946 --> 01:14.616
Steve.
‐ Steve.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.286
I'm still waiting for his page.
‐ Okay.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.036
‐ If you think a thing
is impossible,

01:19.037 --> 01:21.707
you will make it impossible.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.790
Babe, stop.

01:24.793 --> 01:28.513
Shwank! Got your beeper!
I got it!

01:28.505 --> 01:31.505
‐ You look nice today.
‐ No, I don't.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.508
Can't even get
this thing to work.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.509
I'm doing something
good for the world.

01:37.514 --> 01:38.814
How?

01:41.768 --> 01:44.938
My, God.
D's not coming, you guys.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.975
You guys!

01:51.153 --> 01:53.323
Cool. Third wheel.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.834
Hey, you guys. D's not coming.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.707
Boo, I don't care.
‐ Maya, my back.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.115
‐ Sorry.
‐ Oh, my God.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.884
‐ It just, like, sucks.
He's not coming.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.337
‐ Okay, I'm sorry.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.172
You didn't get mad
at Steve when

02:12.174 --> 02:14.304
he jumped on your back,
but you did when I did.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.511
Well, that's because
he didn't put pressure on it.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.681
- You know I have a bad back.
- I'm sorry.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.483
So am I.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.310
Oh, my God.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.476
Hi, how are you?
Would you like to buy

02:28.482 --> 02:31.192
a luminary for
the Walk for Cancer, please?

02:31.193 --> 02:32.863
I like your hair.

02:32.861 --> 02:36.161
‐ You're very cute.
Are you fifth graders?

02:37.949 --> 02:41.079
‐ Um, "so you can choose
a message for your survivor

02:41.078 --> 02:43.708
"or beloved deceased
that you want to remember.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.745
"And we'll write it
for you on the bag.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.329
"The‐‐"
‐ "The message

02:47.334 --> 02:50.174
"is a celebration of
a loved one touched by cancer.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.050
"And on the night of the walk,
each bag becomes a luminary

02:53.048 --> 02:55.258
"lit within by a candle
and that light.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.508
‐ "Reminiscent‐‐
‐ "Reminiscent of

02:56.510 --> 02:57.760
"your loved one's"‐‐my turn.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.351
"Loved one's fighting spirit,

02:59.346 --> 03:00.846
which we celebrate today."

03:15.070 --> 03:17.240
What'd he say?

03:17.239 --> 03:18.869
‐ What?
‐ What did he say?

03:18.865 --> 03:20.945
‐ He's talking to his mom.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.411
It's just this person
spelled Kevin,

03:23.412 --> 03:26.332
Kevine with an E‐‐look.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.131
‐ Are you talking to me or him?

03:28.125 --> 03:32.205
Hi, sorry, Steve.
I was just talking to Maya.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.132
Yeah.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.591
Oh, my God, Steven.

03:35.590 --> 03:41.220
We've been talking on the phone
for, like, so long.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.891
It's been three hours.
‐ Anna, do you like my shirt?

03:44.891 --> 03:48.101
Isn't it good? Is it okay?

03:48.103 --> 03:49.403
Oh, my God.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.856
Sorry, I was talking
to Maya again.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.936
Um‐‐
‐ I think it looks good.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.941
‐ What'd your mom say now?
‐ Personally.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.489
Do you want to see yours?

04:00.490 --> 04:03.620
Oh, my God. Awe.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.038
You know the Walk for Cancer's
tomorrow.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.630
And you and Derrick are coming,
like, what time?

04:14.713 --> 04:16.013
Yeah, tomorrow.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.886
No, we sold enough bags
for all of us to go.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.465
Can you and Derrick reschedule
bowling for another night?

04:24.473 --> 04:25.603
What?

04:27.225 --> 04:30.595
‐ I'm not. Are you mad?
Are you okay?

04:30.604 --> 04:33.944
I'm sorry. No. I don't know.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.490
Do you swear to God?

04:36.485 --> 04:38.605
No, but you do sound mad at me.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.912
Okay, I love you.
Love you so much, bye.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.157
Are you still on?

04:45.368 --> 04:47.118
‐ Is he mad?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.870
‐ Um, he can't come
because they have plans.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.963
Why can't they
just cancel on each other?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.088
‐ Maya, they have plans,
and they promised each other

04:54.085 --> 04:55.995
they were going to do it,
so they can't cancel.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.014
‐ Okay, sorry, but then
maybe it's better

04:58.006 --> 04:59.416
that it's just you and me
and not Steve

04:59.424 --> 05:01.344
'cause it's been
you guys hanging out a lot.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.351
Sorry.
‐ Sorry.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.484
Maya, maybe you should
call Derrick because, like,

05:13.480 --> 05:15.400
if he wants to come,
then he might want to

05:15.398 --> 05:17.478
change his plans and see you,
and then Steve will come too.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.694
‐ I don't want to.
‐ Maya, no, please.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.074
‐ No, Anna, I don't
want to call him.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.452
Why?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.408
‐ Because he's, like,
been really busy and stuff.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.788
‐ What is he doing?
‐ I don't know.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.116
He's not calling me back,
so I don't...

05:30.121 --> 05:32.871
‐ Please, he loves you.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.674
‐ I, like,
don't even know his number.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.381
Oh, my God, yes.
He loves you so much.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.671
‐ Shh!

05:47.889 --> 05:51.849
‐ Oh, my God. Hey, it's Maya.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.732
Maya.
‐ He loves you.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.938
‐ No, I'm calling you
from Anna's phone.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.439
I didn't block my number.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.986
Oh, 'cause you have caller ID.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.027
No, yeah,
it's just Anna's phone.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.490
‐ Ask about the bowling.
‐ Um, are you guys

06:07.492 --> 06:11.452
gonna be coming to
the Walk for Cancer tomorrow?

06:11.454 --> 06:12.504
D?

06:14.082 --> 06:15.792
What'd he say?
Are they gonna come?

06:15.792 --> 06:19.052
‐ Oh, he hung up.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.455
They can't come. Whatever.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.973
It'll be better anyway
without them.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.215
It can just be you and me.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.468
Anna, it's fine.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.520
Anna, me and you time
and people with cancer.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.265
It'll be fun.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.450
Hello, everyone.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.789
Very happy to be here
with all of you today.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.365
Let's do this, you guys.

06:53.371 --> 06:56.711
Our team sold
the second most luminaries.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.921
So let's share our names
and why we're here.

07:01.921 --> 07:05.091
Uh, we'll start with the people
who sold the most bags.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.091
Jay.
‐ Um, I'm Jay.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.724
This is my partner, Roger.
Um, I'm a tent master.

07:11.723 --> 07:16.313
So, I, uh‐‐

07:16.311 --> 07:19.271
I actually lost my mom
to cancer this year.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.691
Yeah.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.819
It's about three months ago.
I just haven't really known‐‐

07:26.821 --> 07:28.071
‐ Do you think we're
gonna have to walk

07:28.073 --> 07:29.623
the whole time because
I don't want to.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.986
I've dragged Roger
here with me.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.292
- No, you didn't. No.
- I did, I did.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.996
‐ Oh, my God, what is wrong?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.996
You're being really crazy
right now.

07:36.998 --> 07:37.998
And I just want to kind of...

07:37.999 --> 07:39.079
What?

07:39.084 --> 07:41.674
Honor him today as we walk.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.210
‐ I have this pit in my stomach

07:43.213 --> 07:44.883
because I think that
Steve's gonna break up with me.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.511
‐ No way.
‐ Girls. Girls. Please.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.799
‐ Sorry.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.052
‐ Anyway, I just want
to honor him today

07:51.054 --> 07:52.264
as we walk.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.933
Now, I'm Roger, by the way.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.982
‐ Hi, Roger.
‐ I have a question.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.596
Are we gonna walk
the whole 24 hours?

07:59.604 --> 08:01.484
'Cause I don't think
that's possible.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.651
‐ Okay, we're gonna need
a talking stick

08:03.650 --> 08:06.320
because people
keep interrupting.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.739
‐ I raised my hand.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.317
‐ This team is going to walk
in shifts, okay?

08:10.323 --> 08:11.493
So no, it won't be
the whole time.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.581
‐ Oh.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.785
The walk is starting now.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.945
Please make your way
to the track, thank you.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.334
‐ I haven't gotten to say
anything yet.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.921
‐ Girls, girls,
why don't you start us off?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.417
- Okay?
- Okay, Minister Eve.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.467
- Okay.
- Okay, Frances.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.875
We can keep‐‐while they're
going.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.723
- I don't know.
- Go ahead, Francis.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.679
My father died
about a year ago.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.930
‐ Like, still don't get when
we're supposed

08:34.931 --> 08:36.561
to sleep and stuff.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.438
And, like, how many miles
we're supposed to walk.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.515
‐ Yeah, I can't‐‐I can't
even do a mile run.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.060
So I don't know.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.773
‐ Yeah, it's 'cause it turns
into the mile walk every time.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.239
Anna, are you
in a better mood now?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.738
‐ No, that just was funny.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.450
‐ Yeah, that's 'cause
I'm here and it's not Steve.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.951
I'm the one who's, like,

08:56.953 --> 08:58.833
making you happy.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.370
Anna, stop.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.964
Oh, my God, okay, I thought
this was the Walk for Cancer?

09:08.173 --> 09:10.133
‐ Maya‐‐
‐ I just‐‐I take it back.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.143
That was mean. That was mean.
No, I didn't mean it.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.215
'Cause you were
trying to laugh at me.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.810
Anna, stop.
‐ Maya, no.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.515
Don't say that.
‐ Are you gonna piss yourself?

09:17.515 --> 09:18.805
Anna, stop. Get up. Get up.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.228
This is your mom, Anna.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.896
You have to get up right now.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.345
Anna.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.112
I'm dying. I'm dying of water.
Please help me.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.609
‐ That's not funny.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.867
Oh, my God.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.525
Oh, you heard the joke?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.333
- I heard it too.
- I'm so sorry.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.869
Oh, my God.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.042
Sorry.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.587
Is someone gonna say something?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.762
'Cause it's just like,
what's going on?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.261
‐ Ha ha.
‐ I'm Sean.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.472
‐ Brett.
‐ Sorry, I said that

09:57.472 --> 10:00.232
as you said your name.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.845
‐ Stop it, Anna.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.360
‐ I'm Maya.
‐ What‐‐yeah, I'm Anna.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.146
‐ Where you guys from?

10:08.149 --> 10:12.029
‐ Um, the town over, Trailview.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.108
Skills.

10:16.741 --> 10:17.911
‐ You go with anyone?

10:19.869 --> 10:24.369
‐ Um, yeah, but our boyfriends
are, like, dead today.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.341
‐ What are you guys doing here?
‐ We like to do good.

10:29.337 --> 10:33.417
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, us too.

10:33.424 --> 10:38.264
‐ Um‐‐
‐ Um, come in our tent?

10:38.263 --> 10:41.273
‐ No, we do have boyfriends.
Sorry, my voice just cracked.

10:41.266 --> 10:44.386
We do, though.
‐ Are you wearing a ring?

10:44.394 --> 10:47.314
‐ We're just not at that point.
‐ It‐‐it's just a tent.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.233
‐ Like‐‐
‐ We're not engaged, like‐‐

10:49.232 --> 10:52.112
‐ "Like, like..."
‐ Okay. We'll go to your tent.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.033
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ They are so hot.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.371
‐ I know. I don't want
to talk about it.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.116
I want to hook up
with the guy from‐‐

11:00.118 --> 11:04.538
this wouldn't happen
if Derrick and Steve were here.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.793
Let's go,
let's pick up that pace

11:08.793 --> 11:10.303
a little bit back there.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.455
We're walking
for a cure here today.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.386
Wait, it's actually stuck.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.017
‐ Your town is cool.
‐ Yeah.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.192
It's stupid, too, though.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.822
Yeah.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.818
Um, I've never seen this
material on a track before.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.161
It's really‐‐it's really nice.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.577
What?
Are you‐‐is your neck okay?

11:53.129 --> 11:56.339
‐ Oh, my God, Anna.
‐ Maya, stop.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.846
‐ Come here, I want
to whisper something to you.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.234
‐ Just say it out loud.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.941
‐ Stop. I can't, seriously.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.529
‐ Okay.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.370
Brett thinks you're cute.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.695
‐ What'd you just say, Sean?
‐ Nothing.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.584
I was just telling Ann here
that you think she's cute.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.632
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.474
‐ I mean, I do, though.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.295
‐ He almost got
class president this year.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.640
And he's fucking funny.
‐ Nah, nah, nah.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.523
‐ You should kiss him.
‐ What?

12:51.521 --> 12:54.401
‐ Mm‐hmm.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.939
‐ Kiss him. Why not?

12:56.943 --> 12:58.653
‐ I can't 'cause
I have a boyfriend.

12:58.653 --> 13:02.663
I told you that.
‐ We went over this.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.697
‐ I'm not a cheater.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.741
‐ She said they're,
like, buried or...

13:06.744 --> 13:09.914
‐ No, I was, like, kidding.
They're not dead.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.794
They're just, like‐‐
they're in high school, so.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.423
‐ They are probably
cheating on you.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.461
- What?
- Honestly.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.223
With some high school girls.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.216
Well‐‐

13:22.218 --> 13:23.508
‐ Just kiss him.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.311
You shouldn't let boyfriends
rule your life.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.635
‐ Yeah,
you should be independent.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.270
‐ We are independent.
We're independent women.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.558
Right?
‐ Yeah.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.441
‐ We just can't.
I just can't, so.

13:34.439 --> 13:38.479
‐ What? That‐‐that's mean.
He has cancer.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.367
‐ No, he doesn't.
‐ What? Yes, he does.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.907
I swear to God he does.
That's fucked up.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.661
‐ Cool.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.632
‐ You guys, that's, like,
really fucked up

13:54.625 --> 13:55.585
to joke about that.

13:55.585 --> 13:56.835
Like, that's not cool.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.206
‐ Yeah, he knows
it's not a joke.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.762
It's his life.
‐ You guys, it's not funny.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.138
‐ See? He does.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.227
‐ That could've been a haircut.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.475
‐ Ask him yourself.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.864
‐ Do you?

14:18.775 --> 14:21.605
‐ Do‐‐do you have cancer?

14:23.654 --> 14:25.114
‐ Yeah.

14:26.741 --> 14:31.001
‐ If you're not lying,
I'm sorry.

14:30.995 --> 14:34.245
‐ Sorry, if you're not lying.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.748
‐ So you gonna kiss him?

14:37.168 --> 14:38.878
‐ Should we keep walking?
‐ Yeah.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.378
‐ Wait, wait.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.339
Just give my man
a kiss on the cheek.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.809
‐ Oh, okay.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.265
‐ Okay.
If it's on the cheek, yeah.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.805
‐ Okay. Oh, my God.

14:53.810 --> 14:58.150
You guys are, like, so crazy.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.192
One.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.244
Two, three.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.116
‐ Ooh, three‐way kiss
is this kid's first kiss.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.618
Player over here.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.582
I'll see you guys out there.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.580
‐ See ya.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.621
‐ See ya.
‐ Peace.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.464
Bye.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.959
Oh, my God, the tent.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.465
If anyone sees my wife,

15:31.472 --> 15:34.602
can you please tell her that
I'm looking for her?

15:34.600 --> 15:38.650
I'm out here in the field.
The 50‐yard line.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.646
- Okay, that was crazy.
- Yeah.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.148
‐ He was lying, right?
‐ I felt bad, but I don't know.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.151
I think so, yeah.
‐ No, I know, I felt bad too.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.453
But I'm kind of like, everyone
gets a haircut like that.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.196
Like, it's called a buzzcut.
‐ Yeah.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.578
‐ Supercuts or whatever.

15:50.575 --> 15:51.985
‐ My God, that would be
so messed up.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.043
You think he just‐‐yeah.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.036
I feel sick, though.
I don't know why.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.078
Assholes, come here.

16:03.421 --> 16:04.711
Us?

16:04.714 --> 16:07.474
‐ You two. Come here.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.295
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Stop.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.312
Did you tell my little brother
he doesn't have cancer?

16:16.309 --> 16:17.849
What?

16:17.852 --> 16:20.652
‐ Did you tell my brother
he doesn't have cancer?

16:20.646 --> 16:23.106
‐ Um‐‐no‐‐
‐ I'm so pissed right now.

16:23.107 --> 16:27.527
‐ We‐‐we didn't. Um‐‐right?

16:27.528 --> 16:28.818
‐ No, we didn't.
‐ Cool.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.071
So you go in a tent with them,
act all flirty,

16:32.074 --> 16:34.164
tell Brett that
he doesn't have cancer,

16:34.160 --> 16:36.830
and laugh when
he shows you his hair?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.709
‐ No, no, we didn't laugh.
We were, like, um‐‐

16:39.707 --> 16:41.827
‐ Oh, my God, okay.
‐ We were, like, um‐‐

16:41.834 --> 16:45.424
‐ Don't say God. You're anti.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.301
‐ So this is
just a misunderstanding

16:47.298 --> 16:50.048
'cause what happened is,
we were on the track.

16:50.051 --> 16:53.971
Um, sorry. Um‐‐
‐ Spit it out.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.311
‐ Sean asked us
to go in his tent.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.096
‐ Yeah, 'cause
he wanted us to, like‐‐

16:57.099 --> 16:58.979
‐ Yeah and he was, like‐‐
‐ Kiss him or whatever.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.186
To kiss him. He has cancer.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.977
And so I was like,
"Oh, are you lying?

17:03.981 --> 17:06.481
Or are you just
trying to get play? Or‐‐"

17:06.484 --> 17:09.704
‐ We didn't know if it was play
or lying or, like...

17:09.695 --> 17:11.065
‐ He's not lying about that.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.275
‐ We didn't know. Sorry.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.829
‐ Just stay the fuck away
from my brother.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.116
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.631
Anna, Anna, do you think
these people are sick?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.878
‐ Sorry.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.723
‐ Team Radical Love,
right, guys?

17:32.718 --> 17:33.798
Keep up the good work,
guys.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.563
Thanks, guys.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.864
Your burning love

17:52.863 --> 17:56.033
For tonight

17:59.120 --> 18:00.500
Hello?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.616
- Brett?
- Sean?

18:04.875 --> 18:08.665
Is that his sister?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.131
Surprise, bitches.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.971
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

18:11.966 --> 18:14.466
- Hi.
- Okay.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.678
‐ Jesus.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.008
Yo.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.849
‐ What's up?

18:24.478 --> 18:27.518
‐ Did your hair get longer?
It's hot.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.983
‐ Thanks.
‐ What's up?

18:28.983 --> 18:30.613
Hey, what's up?

18:30.610 --> 18:33.570
I thought you'd be happy
that we came here.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.871
‐ No, I'm not upset. I'm just‐‐

18:37.825 --> 18:40.905
Um, I'm just really tired.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.251
We were, like, sleeping, so‐‐

18:43.247 --> 18:45.707
It's, like, 6:00.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.248
‐ Okay, but it was
kind of dark out.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.342
‐ Yeah, and we almost got,
like, beat up.

18:50.338 --> 18:54.298
‐ Do we need to take someone?
‐ No.

18:54.300 --> 18:59.100
Um, what happened to bowling?
‐ Where are your meds?

18:59.096 --> 19:00.966
‐ Well, I took my Friday pill

19:00.973 --> 19:02.683
'cause I didn't think
you were coming, like...

19:02.683 --> 19:04.273
‐ Lame.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.848
‐ Also, these guys
tried to hook up with us, D.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.194
‐ What?
‐ Yeah.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.979
‐ Not my girl. Not mine.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.442
No, I didn't do it.
I swear, I didn't.

19:12.443 --> 19:17.413
I just, like, on the cheek
'cause he has cancer.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.326
‐ Did you kiss him too?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.035
‐ Yeah, just on the cheek
really quick.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.495
Just 'cause he's sick.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.035
‐ Yeah, like, he might not
ever get a real one, so.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.001
‐ Oh, yeah.

19:30.961 --> 19:34.381
What?
‐ You're not talking that much.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.182
Are you‐‐what's up?

19:36.175 --> 19:37.585
Did you want us to leave?

19:39.762 --> 19:42.772
‐ Steve, I just told you
what was going on.

19:42.765 --> 19:46.725
And, like, also,

19:46.727 --> 19:48.267
sorry, but can you be sensitive

19:48.270 --> 19:49.690
'cause it's
the Walk for Cancer,

19:49.689 --> 19:51.649
and my grandmother
just died of cancer?

19:51.649 --> 19:53.069
‐ Yeah.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.277
‐ I didn't know
you cared that much.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.027
‐ Wasn't it emphysema?

19:58.030 --> 20:02.200
‐ Uh, yeah, it's cancer.
‐ No, that's not cancer.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.701
‐ Whatever.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.003
‐ Stop being, like,
insensitive.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.456
‐ Are you two
on your periods or something?

20:08.457 --> 20:10.627
‐ She doesn't get that yet.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.956
‐ I'm going to sleep too.
‐ What?

20:12.962 --> 20:16.012
How old are you?
‐ 13!

20:16.006 --> 20:17.716
‐ Ew, dude, that kind of
grosses me out.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.547
She doesn't get her period yet.
What are you, dude?

20:19.552 --> 20:20.762
- A pedophile?
- I'm not.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.141
You're, like, a pedophile, man.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.468
Why don't you just
date a sixth grader, bro?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.312
‐ Steve‐‐
‐ Okay, man. Shut up.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.137
‐ I have my period.
‐ Like, right now?

20:28.144 --> 20:31.484
What? That's gross.
‐ I don't have it right now.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.690
I'm just saying I have it.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.650
I'm not, like,
a freaking pedophile.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.690
‐ Good 'cause that
would be gross.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.164
I don't want to know when you
have your period, like, ever.

20:39.155 --> 20:42.065
I want you to stay hot.
‐ Okay.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.534
‐ You should grow
your hair longer.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.624
Lucy Liu.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.409
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.544
You want some?
‐ What is it?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.842
Vodka.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.296
‐ Um‐‐

20:56.297 --> 20:59.547
I, like, had a lot already.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.927
Chug, chug.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.719
‐ No, thanks.
You guys are being annoying.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.773
I'm over it.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.057
‐ Hey, are you okay?

21:13.522 --> 21:19.282
‐ Yeah. Just‐‐just tired.
‐ Yeah, I am too.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.358
Drunk.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.913
‐ Okay, then
let's go to sleep, like.

21:22.907 --> 21:26.447
‐ Okay, but girls in the middle
so Steve and I no gay, dude.

21:26.452 --> 21:30.372
‐ Shh, there's people
like that on our team.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.372
‐ I just don't want
our butts to touch.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.834
You're missing out.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.506
Be sensitive, like...

21:44.261 --> 21:48.641
Are you okay that they're here?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.351
Yeah.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.601
Are you okay?

21:54.396 --> 21:55.856
Do you want them to go?

21:58.275 --> 21:59.275
Okay.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.822
‐ Are you sure you're okay?

22:03.823 --> 22:08.333
I'm sorry we didn't
come in earlier.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.577
I love you.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.211
‐ I love you too.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.839
‐ Your knee is in my back.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.506
That's my dick.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.668
Thank you. Thank you.

23:09.263 --> 23:12.773
‐ Oh, my God.
They fucking ditched us.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.596
‐ What time is it?

23:30.534 --> 23:31.954
Hey, everybody.

23:33.495 --> 23:36.535
My name is Carl, and I'm sorry
that you all had to listen

23:36.540 --> 23:38.960
to my voice today
on the megaphone.

23:41.045 --> 23:44.125
It's hard to describe
cancer itself

23:44.131 --> 23:46.801
because it was always
just about

23:46.800 --> 23:48.510
these special words they had.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.220
You know, mass.

23:51.221 --> 23:57.101
Be strong. Survivor.
Have goals.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.522
Remission.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.900
All of these key words, but...

24:01.899 --> 24:05.069
the thing that I get to connect
with a lot of you about

24:05.069 --> 24:09.199
today is the, uh,
the departure.

24:09.198 --> 24:12.618
That the people we love go on
before they're even gone.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.248
A mother, a father.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.535
They go on this trip,

24:16.538 --> 24:18.998
and we don't get
to go on it with them.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.879
This trip takes them
somewhere else.

24:21.877 --> 24:25.627
It's like for some of them,
the pain is so great

24:25.631 --> 24:29.551
that the only relief is
to take a bunch of drugs.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.761
Just the day before, their
sickness was just a concept

24:32.763 --> 24:35.313
because we couldn't see
this ride coming.

24:35.307 --> 24:39.137
And then the next day,
it's not a concept anymore

24:39.144 --> 24:43.194
because it‐‐it's a whole
different ride suddenly.

24:43.190 --> 24:47.900
And, uh‐‐but I think
what we all do,

24:47.903 --> 24:53.373
the friend, the daughter,
the father,

24:53.367 --> 24:56.997
the survivor,
I think the strength

24:56.996 --> 25:01.996
that's needed to attend
this‐‐this, uh,

25:02.001 --> 25:07.091
this mountain of a ride
with no definite end point,

25:07.089 --> 25:10.089
no known destination,

25:10.092 --> 25:13.642
is for the fearless
and the brave.

25:13.637 --> 25:17.557
And tonight, right now,
we're all here together

25:17.558 --> 25:21.898
on this same ride,
and it's an honor for me

25:21.895 --> 25:27.435
to connect with all of you
and to be here now.

25:27.443 --> 25:30.533
Tonight, I know
that I'm not alone.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.284
It's not that kind of luminary.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.124
‐ It's not that kind‐‐
‐ Sorry.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.286
It doesn't float.

25:40.289 --> 25:41.789
‐ I thought it was gonna
float up.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.593
Like the ones that float.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.207
So I'm here,
a guy who doesn't

25:48.213 --> 25:49.763
really do things like this.

25:49.757 --> 25:53.177
I'm really glad
that I'm here with you.

25:53.177 --> 25:56.637
‐ Me too. Just you.

25:56.638 --> 26:00.888
I'm very fortunate because
I'm in remission today.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.903
Can we have a moment
of silence, please?

26:27.836 --> 26:30.126
Thank you all so much.

26:54.446 --> 27:00.536
Sit there and
count your fingers

27:00.536 --> 27:07.496
What else can you do

27:07.501 --> 27:14.511
Old girl, you're through

27:14.508 --> 27:18.798
Sit there and count

27:18.804 --> 27:25.564
Your little fingers

27:25.561 --> 27:30.611
Unlucky little girl

27:30.607 --> 27:35.987
Blue

27:35.988 --> 27:39.528
No use old girl

27:39.533 --> 27:45.833
You might as well surrender

27:45.831 --> 27:51.671
Your hope is
getting slender

27:51.670 --> 27:57.380
Why won't somebody send

27:57.384 --> 28:04.394
A tender blue boy

28:04.391 --> 28:11.441
To cheer up
little girl blue

28:58.737 --> 29:01.237
‐ Sorry you lost your mom.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.239
‐ What?

29:06.078 --> 29:10.418
‐ I'm sorry, um‐‐
I'm sorry you lost your mom.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.174
Love you.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.551
‐ I love you.
