1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,970
It's weird D isn't here yet.

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,548
He's coming. He is!

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,854
I brought him
my Thursday pill, look.

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,727
Hi. How are you?

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,097
I'm your neighbor
from down the street.

6
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,443
How are you?

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,978
‐ Good. Is this
the wrapping paper project?

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,571
Because I'm cooking something.

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,316
I get all my gift wrapping at
the Christmas Tree shop, so...

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,489
‐ This is for
the Walk for Cancer.

11
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,869
‐ Yeah and it's through

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,825
my Unitarian Church
in Conchamaguet.

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,405
Um, we're just
selling luminaries.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,540
So if I can just have
another moment of your time.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,670
"You can choose a message
for your survivor

16
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,837
"or beloved deceased
you want to remember.

17
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,335
"We'll write it
for you on a bag."

18
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,127
‐ No, no, I'm sorry.
No, thank you.

19
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,505
‐ Bitch.

20
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,553
Oh, my God.
‐ What are you doing?

21
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,552
‐ I didn't think she heard.
‐ The door was so open.

22
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,894
‐ Geez.
‐ Ha!

23
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,101
‐ We know you're there.

24
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,351
You've, like, done it
three times.

25
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,862
‐ I keep forgetting.
‐ So stupid.

26
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,275
‐ Stop. Don't do that.
‐ Did‐‐

27
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,815
Did D answer yet?

28
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,738
'Cause he said he was
going to be here at three.

29
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,616
Steve.
‐ Steve.

30
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,286
I'm still waiting for his page.
‐ Okay.

31
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,036
‐ If you think a thing
is impossible,

32
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,707
you will make it impossible.

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,790
Babe, stop.

34
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,513
Shwank! Got your beeper!
I got it!

35
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,505
‐ You look nice today.
‐ No, I don't.

36
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,508
Can't even get
this thing to work.

37
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,509
I'm doing something
good for the world.

38
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,814
How?

39
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,938
My, God.
D's not coming, you guys.

40
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,975
You guys!

41
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,323
Cool. Third wheel.

42
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,834
Hey, you guys. D's not coming.

43
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,707
Boo, I don't care.
‐ Maya, my back.

44
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,115
‐ Sorry.
‐ Oh, my God.

45
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,884
‐ It just, like, sucks.
He's not coming.

46
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,337
‐ Okay, I'm sorry.

47
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,172
You didn't get mad
at Steve when

48
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,304
he jumped on your back,
but you did when I did.

49
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,511
Well, that's because
he didn't put pressure on it.

50
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,681
- You know I have a bad back.
- I'm sorry.

51
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,483
So am I.

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,310
Oh, my God.

53
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,476
Hi, how are you?
Would you like to buy

54
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,192
a luminary for
the Walk for Cancer, please?

55
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,863
I like your hair.

56
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,161
‐ You're very cute.
Are you fifth graders?

57
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,079
‐ Um, "so you can choose
a message for your survivor

58
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,708
"or beloved deceased
that you want to remember.

59
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,745
"And we'll write it

00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,329
"The‐‐"

"Loved one's fighting spirit,

which we celebrate today."

68
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,240
What'd he say?

69
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,869
‐ What?
‐ What did he say?

70
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,945
‐ He's talking to his mom.

71
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,411
It's just this person
spelled Kevin,

72
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,332
Kevine with an E‐‐look.

73
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,131
‐ Are you talking to me or him?

74
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,205
Hi, sorry, Steve.
I was just talking to Maya.

75
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,132
Yeah.

76
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,591
Oh, my God, Steven.

77
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,220
We've been talking on the phone
for, like, so long.

78
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,891
It's been three hours.
‐ Anna, do you like my shirt?

79
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,101
Isn't it good? Is it okay?

80
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,403
Oh, my God.

81
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,856
Sorry, I was talking
to Maya again.

82
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,936
Um‐‐
‐ I think it looks good.

83
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,941
‐ What'd your mom say now?
‐ Personally.

84
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,489
Do you want to see yours?

85
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,620
Oh, my God. Awe.

86
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,038
You know the Walk for Cancer's
tomorrow.

87
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,630
And you and Derrick are coming,
like, what time?

88
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,013
Yeah, tomorrow.

89
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,886
No, we sold enough bags
for all of us to go.

90
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,465
Can you and Derrick reschedule
bowling for another night?

91
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,603
What?

92
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,595
‐ I'm not. Are you mad?
Are you okay?

93
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,944
I'm sorry. No. I don't know.

94
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,490
Do you swear to God?

95
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,605
No, but you do sound mad at me.

96
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,912
Okay, I love you.
Love you so much, bye.

97
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,157
Are you still on?

98
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,118
‐ Is he mad?

99
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,870
‐ Um, he can't come
because they have plans.

100
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,963
Why can't they
just cancel on each other?

101
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,088
‐ Maya, they have plans,
and they promised each other

102
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,995
they were going to do it,
so they can't cancel.

103
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,014
‐ Okay, sorry, but then
maybe it's better

104
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,416
that it's just you and me
and not Steve

105
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,344
'cause it's been
you guys hanging out a lot.

106
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,351
Sorry.
‐ Sorry.

107
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,484
Maya, maybe you should
call Derrick because, like,

108
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,400
if he wants to come,
then he might want to

109
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,478
change his plans and see you,
and then Steve will come too.

110
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,694
‐ I don't want to.
‐ Maya, no, please.

111
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,074
‐ No, Anna, I don't
want to call him.

112
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,452
Why?

113
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,408
‐ Because he's, like,
been really busy and stuff.

114
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,788
‐ What is he doing?
‐ I don't know.

115
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,116
He's not calling me back,
so I don't...

116
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,871
‐ Please, he loves you.

117
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,674
‐ I, like,
don't even know his number.

118
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,381
Oh, my God, yes.
He loves you so much.

119
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,671
‐ Shh!

120
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,849
‐ Oh, my God. Hey, it's Maya.

121
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,732
Maya.
‐ He loves you.

122
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,938
‐ No, I'm calling you
from Anna's phone.

123
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,439
I didn't block my number.

124
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,986
Oh, 'cause you have caller ID.

125
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,027
No, yeah,
it's just Anna's phone.

126
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,490
‐ Ask about the bowling.
‐ Um, are you guys

127
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,452
gonna be coming to
the Walk for Cancer tomorrow?

128
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,504
D?

129
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,792
What'd he say?
Are they gonna come?

130
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,052
‐ Oh, he hung up.

131
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,455
They can't come. Whatever.

132
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,973
It'll be better anyway
without them.

133
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,215
It can just be you and me.

134
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,468
Anna, it's fine.

135
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,520
Anna, me and you time
and people with cancer.

136
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,265
It'll be fun.

137
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,450
Hello, everyone.

138
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,789
Very happy to be here
with all of you today.

139
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,365
Let's do this, you guys.

140
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,711
Our team sold
the second most luminaries.

141
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,921
So let's share our names
and why we're here.

142
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,091
Uh, we'll start with the people
who sold the most bags.

143
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,091
Jay.
‐ Um, I'm Jay.

144
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,724
This is my partner, Roger.
Um, I'm a tent master.

145
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:16,313
So, I, uh‐‐

146
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,271
I actually lost my mom
to cancer this year.

147
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,691
Yeah.

148
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,819
It's about three months ago.
I just haven't really known‐‐

149
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,071
‐ Do you think we're
gonna have to walk

150
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,623
the whole time because
I don't want to.

151
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,986
I've dragged Roger
here with me.

152
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,292
- No, you didn't. No.
- I did, I did.

153
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,996
‐ Oh, my God, what is wrong?

154
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,996
You're being really crazy
right now.

155
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,998
And I just want to kind of...

156
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,079
What?

157
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,674
Honor him today as we walk.

158
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,210
‐ I have this pit in my stomach

159
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,883
because I think that
Steve's gonna break up with me.

160
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,511
‐ No way.
‐ Girls. Girls. Please.

161
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,799
‐ Sorry.

162
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,052
‐ Anyway, I just want
to honor him today

163
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,264
as we walk.

164
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,933
Now, I'm Roger, by the way.

165
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,982
‐ Hi, Roger.
‐ I have a question.

166
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,596
Are we gonna walk
the whole 24 hours?

167
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,484
'Cause I don't think
that's possible.

168
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,651
‐ Okay, we're gonna need
a talking stick

169
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,320
because people
keep interrupting.

170
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,739
‐ I raised my hand.

171
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,317
‐ This team is going to walk
in shifts, okay?

172
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,493
So no, it won't be
the whole time.

173
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,581
‐ Oh.

174
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,785
The walk is starting now.

175
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,945
Please make your way
to the track, thank you.

176
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,334
‐ I haven't gotten to say
anything yet.

177
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,921
‐ Girls, girls,
why don't you start us off?

178
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,417
- Okay?
- Okay, Minister Eve.

179
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,467
- Okay.
- Okay, Frances.

180
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,875
We can keep‐‐while they're
going.

181
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,723
- I don't know.
- Go ahead, Francis.

182
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,679
My father died
about a year ago.

183
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,930
‐ Like, still don't get when
we're supposed

184
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,561
to sleep and stuff.

185
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,438
And, like, how many miles
we're supposed to walk.

186
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,515
‐ Yeah, I can't‐‐I can't
even do a mile run.

187
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,060
So I don't know.

188
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,773
‐ Yeah, it's 'cause it turns
into the mile walk every time.

189
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,239
Anna, are you
in a better mood now?

190
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,738
‐ No, that just was funny.

191
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,450
‐ Yeah, that's 'cause
I'm here and it's not Steve.

192
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,951
I'm the one who's, like,

193
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,833
making you happy.

194
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,370
Anna, stop.

195
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,964
Oh, my God, okay, I thought
this was the Walk for Cancer?

196
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,133
‐ Maya‐‐
‐ I just‐‐I take it back.

197
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,143
That was mean. That was mean.
No, I didn't mean it.

198
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,215
'Cause you were
trying to laugh at me.

199
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,810
Anna, stop.
‐ Maya, no.

200
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,515
Don't say that.
‐ Are you gonna piss yourself?

201
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,805
Anna, stop. Get up. Get up.

202
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,228
This is your mom, Anna.

203
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,896
You have to get up right now.

204
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,345
Anna.

205
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,112
I'm dying. I'm dying of water.
Please help me.

206
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,609
‐ That's not funny.

207
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,867
Oh, my God.

208
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,525
Oh, you heard the joke?

209
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,333
- I heard it too.
- I'm so sorry.

210
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,869
Oh, my God.

211
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,042
Sorry.

212
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,587
Is someone gonna say something?

213
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,762
'Cause it's just like,
what's going on?

214
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,261
‐ Ha ha.
‐ I'm Sean.

215
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,472
‐ Brett.
‐ Sorry, I said that

216
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,232
as you said your name.

217
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,845
‐ Stop it, Anna.

218
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,360
‐ I'm Maya.
‐ What‐‐yeah, I'm Anna.

219
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,146
‐ Where you guys from?

220
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,029
‐ Um, the town over, Trailview.

221
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,108
Skills.

222
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,911
‐ You go with anyone?

223
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:24,369
‐ Um, yeah, but our boyfriends
are, like, dead today.

224
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,341
‐ What are you guys doing here?
‐ We like to do good.

225
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,417
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, us too.

226
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:38,264
‐ Um‐‐
‐ Um, come in our tent?

227
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,273
‐ No, we do have boyfriends.
Sorry, my voice just cracked.

228
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,386
We do, though.
‐ Are you wearing a ring?

229
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,314
‐ We're just not at that point.
‐ It‐‐it's just a tent.

230
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,233
‐ Like‐‐
‐ We're not engaged, like‐‐

231
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,112
‐ "Like, like..."
‐ Okay. We'll go to your tent.

232
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,033
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ They are so hot.

233
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,371
‐ I know. I don't want
to talk about it.

234
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,116
I want to hook up
with the guy from‐‐

235
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:04,538
this wouldn't happen
if Derrick and Steve were here.

236
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,793
Let's go,
let's pick up that pace

237
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,303
a little bit back there.

238
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,455
We're walking
for a cure here today.

239
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,386
Wait, it's actually stuck.

240
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,017
‐ Your town is cool.
‐ Yeah.

241
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,192
It's stupid, too, though.

242
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,822
Yeah.

243
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,818
Um, I've never seen this
material on a track before.

244
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,161
It's really‐‐it's really nice.

245
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,577
What?
Are you‐‐is your neck okay?

246
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,339
‐ Oh, my God, Anna.
‐ Maya, stop.

247
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,846
‐ Come here, I want
to whisper something to you.

248
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,234
‐ Just say it out loud.

249
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,941
‐ Stop. I can't, seriously.

250
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,529
‐ Okay.

251
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,370
Brett thinks you're cute.

252
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,695
‐ What'd you just say, Sean?
‐ Nothing.

253
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,584
I was just telling Ann here
that you think she's cute.

254
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,632
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh, my God.

255
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,474
‐ I mean, I do, though.

256
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,295
‐ He almost got
class president this year.

257
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,640
And he's fucking funny.
‐ Nah, nah, nah.

258
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,523
‐ You should kiss him.
‐ What?

259
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,401
‐ Mm‐hmm.

260
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,939
‐ Kiss him. Why not?

261
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,653
‐ I can't 'cause
I have a boyfriend.

262
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,663
I told you that.
‐ We went over this.

263
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,697
‐ I'm not a cheater.

264
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,741
‐ She said they're,
like, buried or...

265
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,914
‐ No, I was, like, kidding.
They're not dead.

266
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,794
They're just, like‐‐
they're in high school, so.

267
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,423
‐ They are probably
cheating on you.

268
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,461
- What?
- Honestly.

269
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,223
With some high school girls.

270
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,216
Well‐‐

271
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,508
‐ Just kiss him.

272
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,311
You shouldn't let boyfriends
rule your life.

273
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,635
‐ Yeah,
you should be independent.

274
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,270
‐ We are independent.
We're independent women.

275
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,558
Right?
‐ Yeah.

276
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,441
‐ We just can't.
I just can't, so.

277
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:38,479
‐ What? That‐‐that's mean.
He has cancer.

278
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,367
‐ No, he doesn't.
‐ What? Yes, he does.

279
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,907
I swear to God he does.
That's fucked up.

280
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,661
‐ Cool.

281
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,632
‐ You guys, that's, like,
really fucked up

282
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,585
to joke about that.

283
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,835
Like, that's not cool.

284
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,206
‐ Yeah, he knows
it's not a joke.

285
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,762
It's his life.
‐ You guys, it's not funny.

286
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,138
‐ See? He does.

287
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,227
‐ That could've been a haircut.

288
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,475
‐ Ask him yourself.

289
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,864
‐ Do you?

290
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,605
‐ Do‐‐do you have cancer?

291
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,114
‐ Yeah.

292
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:31,001
‐ If you're not lying,
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,245
‐ Sorry, if you're not lying.

294
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,748
‐ So you gonna kiss him?

295
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,878
‐ Should we keep walking?
‐ Yeah.

296
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,378
‐ Wait, wait.

297
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,339
Just give my man
a kiss on the cheek.

298
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,809
‐ Oh, okay.

299
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,265
‐ Okay.
If it's on the cheek, yeah.

300
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,805
‐ Okay. Oh, my God.

301
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,150
You guys are, like, so crazy.

302
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,192
One.

303
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,244
Two, three.

304
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,116
‐ Ooh, three‐way kiss
is this kid's first kiss.

305
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,618
Player over here.

306
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,582
I'll see you guys out there.

307
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,580
‐ See ya.

308
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,621
‐ See ya.
‐ Peace.

309
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,464
Bye.

310
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,959
Oh, my God, the tent.

311
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,465
If anyone sees my wife,

312
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,602
can you please tell her that
I'm looking for her?

313
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,650
I'm out here in the field.
The 50‐yard line.

314
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,646
- Okay, that was crazy.
- Yeah.

315
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,148
‐ He was lying, right?
‐ I felt bad, but I don't know.

316
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,151
I think so, yeah.
‐ No, I know, I felt bad too.

317
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,453
But I'm kind of like, everyone
gets a haircut like that.

318
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,196
Like, it's called a buzzcut.
‐ Yeah.

319
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,578
‐ Supercuts or whatever.

320
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,985
‐ My God, that would be
so messed up.

321
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,043
You think he just‐‐yeah.

322
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,036
I feel sick, though.
I don't know why.

323
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,078
Assholes, come here.

324
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,711
Us?

325
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,474
‐ You two. Come here.

326
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,295
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Stop.

327
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,312
Did you tell my little brother
he doesn't have cancer?

328
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,849
What?

329
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,652
‐ Did you tell my brother
he doesn't have cancer?

330
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,106
‐ Um‐‐no‐‐
‐ I'm so pissed right now.

331
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:27,527
‐ We‐‐we didn't. Um‐‐right?

332
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,818
‐ No, we didn't.
‐ Cool.

333
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,071
So you go in a tent with them,
act all flirty,

334
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,164
tell Brett that
he doesn't have cancer,

335
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,830
and laugh when
he shows you his hair?

336
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,709
‐ No, no, we didn't laugh.
We were, like, um‐‐

337
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,827
‐ Oh, my God, okay.
‐ We were, like, um‐‐

338
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,424
‐ Don't say God. You're anti.

339
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,301
‐ So this is
just a misunderstanding

340
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,048
'cause what happened is,
we were on the track.

341
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,971
Um, sorry. Um‐‐
‐ Spit it out.

342
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,311
‐ Sean asked us
to go in his tent.

343
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,096
‐ Yeah, 'cause
he wanted us to, like‐‐

344
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,979
‐ Yeah and he was, like‐‐
‐ Kiss him or whatever.

345
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,186
To kiss him. He has cancer.

346
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,977
And so I was like,
"Oh, are you lying?

347
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,481
Or are you just
trying to get play? Or‐‐"

348
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,704
‐ We didn't know if it was play
or lying or, like...

349
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,065
‐ He's not lying about that.

350
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,275
‐ We didn't know. Sorry.

351
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,829
‐ Just stay the fuck away
from my brother.

352
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,116
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

353
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,631
Anna, Anna, do you think
these people are sick?

354
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,878
‐ Sorry.

355
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,723
‐ Team Radical Love,
right, guys?

356
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,798
Keep up the good work,
guys.

357
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,563
Thanks, guys.

358
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,864
Your burning love

359
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,033
For tonight

360
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,500
Hello?

361
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,616
- Brett?
- Sean?

362
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,665
Is that his sister?

363
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,131
Surprise, bitches.

364
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,971
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

365
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,466
- Hi.
- Okay.

366
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,678
‐ Jesus.

367
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,008
Yo.

368
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,849
‐ What's up?

369
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,518
‐ Did your hair get longer?
It's hot.

370
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,983
‐ Thanks.
‐ What's up?

371
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,613
Hey, what's up?

372
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,570
I thought you'd be happy
that we came here.

373
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,871
‐ No, I'm not upset. I'm just‐‐

374
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,905
Um, I'm just really tired.

375
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,251
We were, like, sleeping, so‐‐

376
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,707
It's, like, 6:00.

377
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,248
‐ Okay, but it was
kind of dark out.

378
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,342
‐ Yeah, and we almost got,
like, beat up.

379
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:54,298
‐ Do we need to take someone?
‐ No.

380
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,100
Um, what happened to bowling?
‐ Where are your meds?

381
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,966
‐ Well, I took my Friday pill

382
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,683
'cause I didn't think
you were coming, like...

383
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,273
‐ Lame.

384
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,848
‐ Also, these guys
tried to hook up with us, D.

385
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,194
‐ What?
‐ Yeah.

386
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,979
‐ Not my girl. Not mine.

387
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,442
No, I didn't do it.
I swear, I didn't.

388
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:17,413
I just, like, on the cheek
'cause he has cancer.

389
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,326
‐ Did you kiss him too?

390
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,035
‐ Yeah, just on the cheek
really quick.

391
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,495
Just 'cause he's sick.

392
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,035
‐ Yeah, like, he might not
ever get a real one, so.

393
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,001
‐ Oh, yeah.

394
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,381
What?
‐ You're not talking that much.

395
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,182
Are you‐‐what's up?

396
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,585
Did you want us to leave?

397
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,772
‐ Steve, I just told you
what was going on.

398
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,725
And, like, also,

399
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,267
sorry, but can you be sensitive

400
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,690
'cause it's
the Walk for Cancer,

401
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,649
and my grandmother
just died of cancer?

402
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,069
‐ Yeah.

403
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,277
‐ I didn't know
you cared that much.

404
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,027
‐ Wasn't it emphysema?

405
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,200
‐ Uh, yeah, it's cancer.
‐ No, that's not cancer.

406
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,701
‐ Whatever.

407
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,003
‐ Stop being, like,
insensitive.

408
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,456
‐ Are you two
on your periods or something?

409
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,627
‐ She doesn't get that yet.

410
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,956
‐ I'm going to sleep too.
‐ What?

411
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,012
How old are you?
‐ 13!

412
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,716
‐ Ew, dude, that kind of
grosses me out.

413
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,547
She doesn't get her period yet.
What are you, dude?

414
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,762
- A pedophile?
- I'm not.

415
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,141
You're, like, a pedophile, man.

416
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,468
Why don't you just
date a sixth grader, bro?

417
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,312
‐ Steve‐‐
‐ Okay, man. Shut up.

418
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,137
‐ I have my period.
‐ Like, right now?

419
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,484
What? That's gross.
‐ I don't have it right now.

420
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,690
I'm just saying I have it.

421
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,650
I'm not, like,
a freaking pedophile.

422
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,690
‐ Good 'cause that
would be gross.

423
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,164
I don't want to know when you
have your period, like, ever.

424
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,065
I want you to stay hot.
‐ Okay.

425
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,534
‐ You should grow
your hair longer.

426
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,624
Lucy Liu.

427
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,409
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

428
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,544
You want some?
‐ What is it?

429
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,842
Vodka.

430
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,296
‐ Um‐‐

431
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,547
I, like, had a lot already.

432
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,927
Chug, chug.

433
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,719
‐ No, thanks.
You guys are being annoying.

434
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,773
I'm over it.

435
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,057
‐ Hey, are you okay?

436
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:19,282
‐ Yeah. Just‐‐just tired.
‐ Yeah, I am too.

437
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,358
Drunk.

438
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,913
‐ Okay, then
let's go to sleep, like.

439
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,447
‐ Okay, but girls in the middle
so Steve and I no gay, dude.

440
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,372
‐ Shh, there's people
like that on our team.

441
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,372
‐ I just don't want
our butts to touch.

442
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,834
You're missing out.

443
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,506
Be sensitive, like...

444
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:48,641
Are you okay that they're here?

445
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,351
Yeah.

446
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,601
Are you okay?

447
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,856
Do you want them to go?

448
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,275
Okay.

449
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,822
‐ Are you sure you're okay?

450
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:08,333
I'm sorry we didn't
come in earlier.

451
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,577
I love you.

452
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,211
‐ I love you too.

453
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,839
‐ Your knee is in my back.

454
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,506
That's my dick.

455
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,668
Thank you. Thank you.

456
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,773
‐ Oh, my God.
They fucking ditched us.

457
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,596
‐ What time is it?

458
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,954
Hey, everybody.

459
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,535
My name is Carl, and I'm sorry
that you all had to listen

460
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,960
to my voice today
on the megaphone.

461
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,125
It's hard to describe
cancer itself

462
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,801
because it was always
just about

463
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,510
these special words they had.

464
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,220
You know, mass.

465
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:57,101
Be strong. Survivor.
Have goals.

466
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,522
Remission.

467
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,900
All of these key words, but...

468
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,069
the thing that I get to connect
with a lot of you about

469
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:09,199
today is the, uh,
the departure.

470
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,618
That the people we love go on
before they're even gone.

471
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,248
A mother, a father.

472
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,535
They go on this trip,

473
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,998
and we don't get
to go on it with them.

474
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,879
This trip takes them
somewhere else.

475
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,627
It's like for some of them,
the pain is so great

476
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:29,551
that the only relief is
to take a bunch of drugs.

477
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,761
Just the day before, their
sickness was just a concept

478
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,313
because we couldn't see
this ride coming.

479
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,137
And then the next day,
it's not a concept anymore

480
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:43,194
because it‐‐it's a whole
different ride suddenly.

481
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,900
And, uh‐‐but I think
what we all do,

482
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:53,373
the friend, the daughter,
the father,

483
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,997
the survivor,
I think the strength

484
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:01,996
that's needed to attend
this‐‐this, uh,

485
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:07,091
this mountain of a ride
with no definite end point,

486
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,089
no known destination,

487
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,642
is for the fearless
and the brave.

488
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,557
And tonight, right now,
we're all here together

489
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,898
on this same ride,
and it's an honor for me

490
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:27,435
to connect with all of you
and to be here now.

491
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,533
Tonight, I know
that I'm not alone.

492
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,284
It's not that kind of luminary.

493
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,124
‐ It's not that kind‐‐
‐ Sorry.

494
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,286
It doesn't float.

495
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,789
‐ I thought it was gonna
float up.

496
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,593
Like the ones that float.

497
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,207
So I'm here,
a guy who doesn't

498
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,763
really do things like this.

499
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:53,177
I'm really glad
that I'm here with you.

500
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,637
‐ Me too. Just you.

501
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,888
I'm very fortunate because
I'm in remission today.

502
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,903
Can we have a moment
of silence, please?

503
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,126
Thank you all so much.

504
00:26:54,446 --> 00:27:00,536
Sit there and
count your fingers

505
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:07,496
What else can you do

506
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:14,511
Old girl, you're through

507
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,798
Sit there and count

508
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:25,564
Your little fingers

509
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:30,611
Unlucky little girl

510
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:35,987
Blue

511
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:39,528
No use old girl

512
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:45,833
You might as well surrender

513
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:51,671
Your hope is
getting slender

514
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:57,380
Why won't somebody send

515
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:04,394
A tender blue boy

516
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:11,441
To cheer up
little girl blue
