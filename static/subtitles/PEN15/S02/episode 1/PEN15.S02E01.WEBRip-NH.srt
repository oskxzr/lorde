Literally staring. Oh, my god.
I feel smothered by him.

00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,042
Maybe we should just like stay
five minutes and then leave.

‐ that's all I thought
we were doing here.

Just five minutes.

191
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,628
There's nobody here that I wanna see.

192
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,168
‐ yeah, for sure.

193
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,377
Do you want me to go
say something to him?

194
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,974
‐ who? ‐ Sam.

195
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,758
Oh, my god.

196
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,312
He keeps looking at you.
‐ no, he isn't. Stop.

197
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,926
I'm gonna go say something to him.

198
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,523
He needs to know... ‐ no.

199
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,768
‐ that you cannot be someone
else on aim. It's... Illegal.

200
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,770
‐ okay, fine, like I
don't want any drama,

201
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,362
but just like say something
to him and, like,

202
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,938
make it seem like I don't
care, 'cause I don't.

203
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,193
‐ oh, I know you don't care.

204
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,654
- ‐ I don't care.
- ‐ I know.

205
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,494
‐ so then just like
don't make any drama.

206
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,949
Just, like, do it. Whatever. ‐ okay.

207
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,079
‐ I think I should also
just go to Brendan, then.

208
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,696
It's time to move on.

209
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,413
‐ okay. ‐ like, honestly, it's time.

210
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,833
‐ okay. ‐ like, I'm‐‐I'm ready.

211
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,332
‐ Maya, no drama. ‐ okay, no drama.

212
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,298
Sss...

213
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,006
Hey.

214
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,427
What's up?

215
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,006
‐ what's up?

216
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,140
‐ um, I just wanted to have a
mature conversation with you,

217
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,019
if you're all about
it, just address the

218
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,516
elephants in the basement.

219
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,349
‐ sure.

220
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,524
Um...

221
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,982
I just think it's really messed up

222
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,982
that you pretended to be
somebody else on aim.

223
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,324
Like... Who does that?

224
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,070
And we just think you're a tool.

225
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:56,203
So... Just super weird because
you used to be our best friend.

226
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,455
‐ well, there's two
sides to every story.

227
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,996
‐ oh, yeah?

228
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,129
Yeah. ‐ so you're not gonna apologize.

229
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,956
Are you seriously not gonna apologize?

230
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,551
‐ maybe I already did apologize.

231
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,586
But she didn't tell you
that, though, right?

232
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,801
‐ okay, maybe she did.
Maybe she did not.

233
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,852
All I know is that she's my best friend

234
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,926
on god's green frickin' earth,

235
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,481
and I love her, and she
would never lie to me.

236
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,556
Ever.

237
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,321
‐ well, we're kinda in the
middle of something here.

238
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,275
‐ okay, what are you in the middle of?
I'm sorry.

239
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,145
‐ oh, it's‐‐it's weasels.

240
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,492
See, I made this whole magazine.

241
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,158
Yeah. See, uh, this is one that I drew.

242
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,117
See, it's got buck teeth and it's got‐‐

243
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,737
‐ you guys have to grow up.

244
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,294
Like, do you think that this
is gonna fly in eighth grade?

245
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,458
You <i>have</i> to be more mature.

246
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,421
Okay?

247
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,180
‐ sup?

248
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,546
‐ hi. ‐ um...

249
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,643
Basically, I'm here to tell
you that Anna's over you.

250
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,180
And she's just, like, done, and she
doesn't want anything to do with you,

251
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,064
and you just gotta move
on, and I'm sorry.

252
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,232
‐ that's‐‐that's fine.

253
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,901
I'm dating Marissa h.

254
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,490
‐ okay. Cool.

255
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,815
So, what, you're like... Wait!

256
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,321
That's icebox. You're dating icebox?

257
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,783
‐ She prefers Marissa h.

258
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,084
And just so you know, she did
not masturbate with ice.

259
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,909
- ‐ yeah, right.
- In fourth grade,

260
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,964
she was dared to put an ice
cube in her underwear.

261
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,049
That rumor's very heavily exaggerated.

262
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,875
‐ whatever. I've‐‐we can have
different opinions on what happened,

263
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,381
but, like, basically,
all you need to know

264
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,683
is you need to just,
like, end it with Anna.

265
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,258
‐ what?

266
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,933
‐ lt's a good chat.

267
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,851
Sorry I... Hurt your feelings.

268
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,604
Brendan's totally over you.

269
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,444
Completely. ‐

270
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,689
‐ he is, he's dating
icebox now, I guess.

271
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,823
‐ what?

272
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,570
I didn't know that. ‐ yeah.

273
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,202
‐ I didn't even know he was
into girls like that, so...

274
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,239
‐ but, like, she's a slut bag.

275
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,163
‐ yeah, at least I'm not like that.

276
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,332
‐ anyway, it doesn't matter.

277
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,750
- ‐ yeah, I don't care.
- It doesn't matter.

278
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,538
It doesn't matter. It's icebox.
‐ I don't care!

279
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,922
‐ like..."I put ice in my vagina!"

280
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,089
‐ wow. ‐ and she's a slut.

281
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,259
You have, like, so many better
options, and it doesn't matter.

282
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,888
‐ yeah, I do, I have a lot.
‐ you have so many options.

283
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,136
‐ so let's just leave.

284
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,967
‐ yeah, let's go. ‐ right?

285
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,932
‐ let's go. This place sucks.

286
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,392
‐ blows.

287
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,022
‐ no‐‐stop, stop!

288
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,899
- Is that Brandt?
- No, no, no, no.

289
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,566
Stop, stop, stop‐‐ Anna:

290
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,605
<i>- Want me to finger you?
- Yeah.</i>

291
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,990
<i>You have both really hard nips.</i>

292
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,357
<i>- I love you.

‐ whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

311
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,159
Absolutely no coming in the
house while you're wet.

312
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,369
I told you guys that.

313
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,039
‐ we're not wet. ‐ yes, you are.

314
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,497
I can still see a little
bit of water on you.

315
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,037
So dry off, okay?

316
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,250

Sorry! ‐ thank you.

Ow.

You know, like...

345
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,437
Brandt!

346
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,015
‐ the fuck.

347
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,400
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

348
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,726
‐ like when me, you, and‐‐

349
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,942
Anna, like, went

350
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,032
into the closet

351
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,448
and you, like, up and
down, in circles...

352
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,960
Remember how hard‐nipped I got‐‐

353
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,168
nope. That didn't happen.

354
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,499
‐ what‐‐

355
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,344
what do you mean, it didn't happen?

356
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,759
That‐‐brandt.

357
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,178
Are you f‐‐

358
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,147
‐ I'm so sorry.

359
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,766
What's goin' on?

360
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,284
‐ he said it didn't happen.

361
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,696
‐ what didn't happen?

362
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,565
‐ like I was just trying
to talk to Brandt

363
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,992
about how we did second base... ‐ yeah.

364
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,160
‐ and he, like, didn't know
what I was talking about.

365
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,199
‐ what?

366
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,413
‐ like, he said it didn't happen.

367
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,578
‐ that's a lie. ‐ I know, right?

368
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,173
Like, we did it. ‐ yeah,
he was freaking there.

369
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,459
That little freaking asshole. ‐ I mean, we
did it, like, we put the hands up and down

370
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,423
and we did the circle motions,
everything. ‐ all around.

371
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,053
‐ and like one hand on your boob...
‐ it was.

372
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,680
‐ and one hand on my boob,
and he, like, didn't know

373
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,507
what I was talking about. ‐ and
then there were the circles.

374
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,432
Well, it happened. Why
would he lie about that?

375
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,352
‐ I don't know.

376
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,601
Do you think it's 'cause he
thinks I'm ugly or something?

377
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,234
‐ no.

378
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,821
‐ be honest.

379
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,316
‐ no!

380
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,647
If he does, he's a psychopath.

381
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,329
It happened, and I
think I know who saw.

382
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,497
Hey, Brendan.

383
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,615
Um, I just wanted to
touch base with you.

384
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,253
I know that...

385
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,040
Little rude to you earlier.

386
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,553
And she can just be that way sometimes.

387
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,756
But I heard that you're

388
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,586
going out with someone
new, and that's fine.

389
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,473
It doesn't change what we had

390
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,009
or what we went through together.

391
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,063
What? ‐ say it.

392
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,766
‐ um...

393
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,686
Also, like, you know how
when, at the dance,

394
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,356
like when Brandt just
pulled us away from you?

395
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,815
We were‐‐we were, like, grinding and
then he was like, "no! You come here."

396
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,817
Do you remember that?

397
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,489
'Cause he's saying that that
didn't happen. I'm like, "it did."

398
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,947
It did, right, it did?

399
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,408
‐ I don't wanna get involved
with the drama, Anna.

400
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,369
I‐I've moved on. I suggest you do too.

401
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,170
‐ oh, yeah. No, I know‐‐

402
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,875
to Marissa h. I haven't heard
one bad thing about her, so...

403
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,247
‐ me and her have a really
good rhythm with our kissing.

404
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,339
Peace.

405
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,131
Peace.

406
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,934
Good‐bye.

407
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,011
‐ so somebody saw. ‐ no‐‐

408
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,064
‐ someone here has seen, so
we need to go up to people,

409
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,848
and we have to get proof.

410
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,901
‐ no, but Brandt said in the
closet not to tell anyone.

411
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,515
He's gonna get mad. Please don't.

412
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,521
‐ Maya, who cares?

413
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,694
‐ okay. Okay, fine, okay.

414
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,613
We're gonna go up to people.
We're gonna get proof.

415
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,572
We're just not gonna let them
know everything that happened.

416
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,622
We're not gonna give it all away.

417
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,656
Me and Anna and Brandt
went into a closet.

418
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,200
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened, okay?

419
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,584
‐ I'll say a word, and you tell me

420
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,830
the first thing that comes
to your mind‐‐loset.

421
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,543
Deposit.

422
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,633
‐ do you know who Brandt is? He
was just showing up a second ago.

423
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,339
He had a butt cut and
he was saying hello.

424
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,875
‐ mafoset.

425
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,053
‐ and we basically hooked up.

426
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,051
I'm not gonna say what it rhymes with,

427
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,222
but it's second base.

428
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,600
‐ you ever seen three people together?

429
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,927
‐ we touched each other, but
on the chest, nothing else.

430
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,773
And he said it didn't
happen, but it did.

431
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,898
‐ you ever been to a dance? If
you say no, I don't believe you.

432
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,975
‐ you bitch‐‐I know you're
lying to me right now.

433
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,571
He went up and down, and
then he did circle motions.

434
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,226
And then he did circle motions.

435
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,284
Motion and a motion on the
boobies, you know what I mean?

436
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,068
Maybe he does love me, 'cause he went
up and down a little bit more on me.

437
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,662
I knew it. It's so weird.

438
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,287
But then he said "I love you,"
and then I said I love you back

439
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,325
and then now he's taking it back,

440
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,447
and now I don't know what it means,

441
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,663
and so I guess I'm just asking you

442
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,753
'cause you're his best friend,

443
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,117
like what does that mean?

444
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,964
‐ you just told me, right?

445
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,709
You should go talk to Brandt.

446
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,171
‐ ca‐can you tell me where he is?

447
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,591
‐ he's in my room.

448
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,600
<i>From the start,</i>

449
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,179
<i>clearly the aggressor on ziggo.</i>

450
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,313
<i>Ziggo spinning and spinning...</i>

451
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,991
‐

452
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,247
Oh, hey.

453
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,756
<i>There goes the ramp. The wheel is off.</i>

454
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,505
<i>Oh!</i> <i>And now look at this.</i>

455
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,261
‐ sup?

456
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,981
Do you want me to leave? Be honest.

457
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,652
It's like I'm stalking
you or something.

458
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,196
<i>‐ do not turn your back‐‐
oh, he turned his back!</i>

459
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,565
Oh, whoa.

460
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,201
<i>‐ this is the final
slap of humiliation.</i>

461
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,714
‐ were you just joking when you said
that the three‐way in the closet

462
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,090
didn't happen?

463
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,798
‐ what? Yeah, whatever.

464
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,051
‐ so you're saying it happened.

465
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,012
‐ yeah. Whatever.

466
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,474
- ‐ okay.
<i>- That is all ziggo</i>

467
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:47,854
<i>just tearin' up that wood
like a beaver on speed.</i>

468
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,063
‐ wait, I'm, like, so
sorry I came up to you

469
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,364
in the pool like that.

470
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,567
- I'm so lame.
- Yeah.

471
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,277
Whatever. It's cool.

472
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,737
I still think you're,
like, pretty or whatever.

473
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,698
So... Could you move? Cutie?

474
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,870
‐ okay.

475
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,828
I'll sit down.

476
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,749
<i>I'm missing a whole lot of examples.</i>

477
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,418
<i>But you fought hard because you lost to
this man right here, ziggo, Jonathan.</i>

478
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,089
<i>Yes, yes, I know pretty well, so...</i>

479
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,128
<i>It was impressive. I want you
guys, though, to shake hands.</i>

480
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,973
‐ Spencer saw it all, motherfucker!

481
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,298
‐ Anna, he already said it. Get out!

482
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,563
He just said it happened.

483
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,096
‐ oh, you can get out.
He said it happened.

484
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,639
Get out.

485
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,437
Sorry.

486
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,818
‐ looks like it's just
the three of us again.

487
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,025
I'm really glad that
you guys have made up.

488
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,991

489
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,198
‐ yeah. ‐ yes, okay?

490
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,738
Just keep your mouth shut about it.

491
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,832
I don't want that getting out.

492
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,658
Yeah. ‐ okay.

518
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,602
‐ we are! ‐ we are.

519
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,352
- ‐ keep it movin', let's go!
- Sorry.

520
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,234
‐ I was thinking I would
maybe put something

521
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,071
in Brandt's locker today to, like,
remind him of me, but is that crazy?

522
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,647
‐ no, I love that. ‐ so desperate
for some water right now.

523
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,170
‐ yeah, then go get some!

524
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,245
‐ I could get you some.

525
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,751
‐ okay, he is like obsessed
with you‐‐I'm not kidding.

526
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,513
- This is so crazy.
- ‐

527
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,642
fucking slut.

528
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,095
- ‐ slut?
- Anna, Maya.

529
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,426
Hey, can I talk to you
guys for a second?

530
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,771
Just... People have been talking,

531
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,387
and I thought you should know.

532
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,314
‐ okay, jenna‐‐ ‐ okay, Maya,
I'll get to you in a second.

533
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:40,193
Anna, at the dance, you were
freaking with everyone.

534
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,902
Uh, Maya, you too!

535
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,872
You were so desperate trying to
get Sam's attention all night.

536
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,575
And then you had a
three‐some with Brandt,

537
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,286
and that's fucked up.

538
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,366
‐ ‐ what, uh...

539
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,793
A th‐‐ ‐ that didn't happen.

540
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,172
Who did you hear that from?
Yeah, where did you hear that?

541
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,799
‐ 'cause I didn't do that. I didn't‐‐

542
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,756
‐ yeah, I didn't do it either.
‐ we didn't do that.

543
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,086
‐ I mean, it's pretty obvious.

544
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,471
‐ that's absolutely nasty.
‐ actually...

545
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,468
Crazy, like crazy, crazy, crazy!

546
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,221
You're crazy. ‐ okay, yeah, whatever.

547
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,483
Just thought you should know
that everyone is saying

548
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,435
that you're desperate sluts.

549
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,976
And what makes me really sad

550
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,281
is that you've changed.

551
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,896
Like, a lot.

552
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,329
‐ didn't happen.

553
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,947
‐ yeah, Jenna, you don't know
what you're talking about!

554
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,126
I don't like her.

555
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,474
‐ she's crazy.

556
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,972
Do you think I've changed?

557
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,602
‐ who? ‐ do you think I've changed.

558
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,770
‐ you? ‐ yeah.

559
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,230
Do you?

560
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,769
‐ I think that we all
change all the time

561
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,693
and that that's just normal.

562
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,111
‐ so you do! ‐ I don't
know how to answer this.

563
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,739
‐ you think I've changed
like in a bad way.

564
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,736
‐ I don't know how to answer this!
Mostly good, mostly good!

565
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,988
‐ oh, my god. ‐ no, mostly good.

566
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,080
It's just when we were
at the dance, like...

567
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,656
You were, like, grinding with
just a few more people than me,

568
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,873
and like when we were having the
fight, I looked across the gym

569
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,093
and you were, like, three‐waying
kind of with Gabe and jafeer.

570
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:24,625
‐ but so you're saying I had
two three‐ways that night?

571
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,420
Did I have two threesomes that night?

572
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,763
‐ you had two, but I had one.

573
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,349
Like, who am I? ‐ so then I'm
more of a slut than you!

574
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,005
That's what you're saying right now!

575
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,023
‐ no, I'm saying if you
are, then I am too 'cause‐‐

576
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,265
‐ no, you haven't changed.
You just did one.

577
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,847
‐ no, I'm just saying
that we‐‐ ‐ oh, my god.

578
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:42,822
‐ I get why people are
saying this about us.

579
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,073
‐ so we're desperate sluts.

580
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,990
Great.

581
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,369
And now everyone knows and
Brandt's gonna be so mad.

582
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,237
He's gonna hate us.

583
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,754
‐ Brandt's a slut too. Ha.

584
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,415
‐ no, he's just a player.

585
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,508
‐ oh, yeah.

586
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,508
He's just a player.
