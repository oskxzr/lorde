09:00.999 --> 09:03.129
Yeah. ‐ so you're not gonna apologize.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.956
Are you seriously not gonna apologize?

09:04.961 --> 09:06.551
‐ maybe I already did apologize.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.586
But she didn't tell you
that, though, right?

09:09.591 --> 09:12.801
‐ okay, maybe she did.
Maybe she did not.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.852
All I know is that she's my best friend

09:14.846 --> 09:16.926
on god's green frickin' earth,

09:16.931 --> 09:19.481
and I love her, and she
would never lie to me.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.556
Ever.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.321
‐ well, we're kinda in the
middle of something here.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.275
‐ okay, what are you in the middle of?
I'm sorry.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.145
‐ oh, it's‐‐it's weasels.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.492
See, I made this whole magazine.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.158
Yeah. See, uh, this is one that I drew.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.117
See, it's got buck teeth and it's got‐‐

09:36.117 --> 09:37.737
‐ you guys have to grow up.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.294
Like, do you think that this
is gonna fly in eighth grade?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.458
You <i>have</i> to be more mature.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.421
Okay?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.180
‐ sup?

09:53.176 --> 09:55.546
‐ hi. ‐ um...

09:55.553 --> 09:58.643
Basically, I'm here to tell
you that Anna's over you.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.180
And she's just, like, done, and she
doesn't want anything to do with you,

10:01.184 --> 10:04.064
and you just gotta move
on, and I'm sorry.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.232
‐ that's‐‐that's fine.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.901
I'm dating Marissa h.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.490
‐ okay. Cool.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.815
So, what, you're like... Wait!

10:12.821 --> 10:15.321
That's icebox. You're dating icebox?

10:15.323 --> 10:17.783
‐ She prefers Marissa h.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.084
And just so you know, she did
not masturbate with ice.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.909
- ‐ yeah, right.
- In fourth grade,

10:22.914 --> 10:25.964
she was dared to put an ice
cube in her underwear.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.049
That rumor's very heavily exaggerated.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.875
‐ whatever. I've‐‐we can have
different opinions on what happened,

10:31.881 --> 10:33.381
but, like, basically,
all you need to know

10:33.383 --> 10:36.683
is you need to just,
like, end it with Anna.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.258
‐ what?

10:38.263 --> 10:39.933
‐ lt's a good chat.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.851
Sorry I... Hurt your feelings.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.604
Brendan's totally over you.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.444
Completely. ‐

10:48.439 --> 10:51.689
‐ he is, he's dating
icebox now, I guess.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.823
‐ what?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.570
I didn't know that. ‐ yeah.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.202
‐ I didn't even know he was
into girls like that, so...

10:58.199 --> 11:00.239
‐ but, like, she's a slut bag.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.163
‐ yeah, at least I'm not like that.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.332
‐ anyway, it doesn't matter.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.750
- ‐ yeah, I don't care.
- It doesn't matter.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.538
It doesn't matter. It's icebox.
‐ I don't care!

11:07.542 --> 11:09.922
‐ like..."I put ice in my vagina!"

11:11.379 --> 11:13.089
‐ wow. ‐ and she's a slut.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.259
You have, like, so many better
options, and it doesn't matter.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.888
‐ yeah, I do, I have a lot.
‐ you have so many options.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.136
‐ so let's just leave.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.967
‐ yeah, let's go. ‐ right?

11:20.972 --> 11:22.932
‐ let's go. This place sucks.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.392
‐ blows.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.022
‐ no‐‐stop, stop!

11:26.019 --> 11:27.899
- Is that Brandt?
- No, no, no, no.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.566
Stop, stop, stop‐‐ Anna:

11:30.565 --> 11:33.605
<i>- Want me to finger you?
- Yeah.</i>

11:33.610 --> 11:35.990
<i>You have both really hard nips.</i>

11:35.987 --> 11:38.357
<i>- I love you.
- And I love you too.</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:39.874
Stop, stop, stop.

11:39.866 --> 11:43.696
‐ oh, my god, stop, stop! ‐
stop, stop, Anna, stop it!

11:43.703 --> 11:45.373
‐ Brandt‐‐

11:45.371 --> 11:47.581
‐ stop!

11:51.628 --> 11:53.628
- Go talk to him.
- No, you talk to him.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.840
Do you think he's here for you? ‐ no!

11:54.839 --> 11:58.009
‐ go! ‐ yes, I don't know! Maybe.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.839
- He is here for you.
- Okay, it's like, okay.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.934
Go now. Okay‐‐I don't know. Okay, yeah.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.345
Hey, what's up, man? ‐ what's up?

12:05.350 --> 12:07.690
- ‐ he's here for Isaac.
- ‐ he's here for.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.095
He's here for Isaac.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.864
‐ he doesn't know you're here. Ow.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.777
- Go.
- Oh, my god, okay.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.236
‐ you're gonna get your
first frickin' kiss‐‐go.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.026
‐ okay, all right. This is happening.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.609
Let's just frickin' go.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.204
‐ whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.159
Absolutely no coming in the
house while you're wet.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.369
I told you guys that.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.039
‐ we're not wet. ‐ yes, you are.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.497
I can still see a little
bit of water on you.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.037
So dry off, okay?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.250
‐ sorry. ‐ we'll take care of it.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.580
‐ there's a towel.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.094
Sorry! ‐ thank you.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.626
Thanks, girls.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.379
‐ sneak in, sneak in. Come, come‐‐

12:37.382 --> 12:38.552
‐ nope.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.509
Still too wet.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.257
Ow.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.523
My god, she just like.

12:50.979 --> 12:54.399
- Am I dry yet?
- Cannonball!

12:56.401 --> 12:58.701
‐ cannonball!

13:21.843 --> 13:23.223
‐ sup?

13:28.766 --> 13:31.686
It's kinda funny you're here right now.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.064
‐ how?

13:35.064 --> 13:37.534
‐ it's so lame here!

13:37.525 --> 13:40.145
‐ it's my friend's party, so...

13:40.153 --> 13:42.533
It's kinda cool, actually.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.740
‐ yeah, it is pretty cool.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.198
Haven't, like...

13:48.202 --> 13:49.872
Seen you since the dance

13:49.871 --> 13:51.831
or like talked to you, it seems like.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.791
‐ we haven't, so...
That's probably why.

13:54.792 --> 13:55.752
Yeah.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.882
Have you, um...

13:57.879 --> 14:00.629
Have you thought about
what happened on Friday?

14:00.631 --> 14:03.051
‐ I don't‐‐what are you talking about?

14:03.051 --> 14:04.801
‐

14:04.802 --> 14:07.892
You're being so funny right now.

14:07.889 --> 14:11.019
You know, like...

14:11.017 --> 14:12.437
Brandt!

14:12.435 --> 14:14.015
‐ the fuck.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.400
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.726
‐ like when me, you, and‐‐

14:17.732 --> 14:19.942
Anna, like, went

14:19.942 --> 14:22.032
into the closet

14:22.028 --> 14:25.448
and you, like, up and
down, in circles...

14:34.290 --> 14:35.960
Remember how hard‐nipped I got‐‐

14:35.958 --> 14:38.168
nope. That didn't happen.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.499
‐ what‐‐

14:39.504 --> 14:41.344
what do you mean, it didn't happen?

14:41.339 --> 14:43.759
That‐‐brandt.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.178
Are you f‐‐

14:54.977 --> 14:57.147
‐ I'm so sorry.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.766
What's goin' on?

14:59.774 --> 15:02.284
‐ he said it didn't happen.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.696
‐ what didn't happen?

15:04.695 --> 15:06.565
‐ like I was just trying
to talk to Brandt

15:06.572 --> 15:07.992
about how we did second base... ‐ yeah.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.160
‐ and he, like, didn't know
what I was talking about.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.199
‐ what?

15:12.203 --> 15:14.413
‐ like, he said it didn't happen.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.578
‐ that's a lie. ‐ I know, right?

15:17.583 --> 15:20.173
Like, we did it. ‐ yeah,
he was freaking there.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.459
That little freaking asshole. ‐ I mean, we
did it, like, we put the hands up and down

15:22.463 --> 15:24.423
and we did the circle motions,
everything. ‐ all around.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.053
‐ and like one hand on your boob...
‐ it was.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.680
‐ and one hand on my boob,
and he, like, didn't know

15:27.677 --> 15:29.507
what I was talking about. ‐ and
then there were the circles.

15:29.512 --> 15:33.432
Well, it happened. Why
would he lie about that?

15:33.432 --> 15:35.352
‐ I don't know.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.601
Do you think it's 'cause he
thinks I'm ugly or something?

15:38.604 --> 15:40.234
‐ no.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.821
‐ be honest.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.316
‐ no!

15:43.317 --> 15:46.647
If he does, he's a psychopath.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.329
It happened, and I
think I know who saw.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.497
Hey, Brendan.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.615
Um, I just wanted to
touch base with you.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.253
I know that...

15:59.250 --> 16:01.040
Little rude to you earlier.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.553
And she can just be that way sometimes.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.756
But I heard that you're

16:05.756 --> 16:08.586
going out with someone
new, and that's fine.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.473
It doesn't change what we had

16:10.469 --> 16:12.009
or what we went through together.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.063
What? ‐ say it.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.766
‐ um...

16:15.766 --> 16:18.686
Also, like, you know how
when, at the dance,

16:18.686 --> 16:21.356
like when Brandt just
pulled us away from you?

16:21.355 --> 16:24.815
We were‐‐we were, like, grinding and
then he was like, "no! You come here."

16:24.817 --> 16:26.817
Do you remember that?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.489
'Cause he's saying that that
didn't happen. I'm like, "it did."

16:28.487 --> 16:30.947
It did, right, it did?

16:30.948 --> 16:33.408
‐ I don't wanna get involved
with the drama, Anna.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.369
I‐I've moved on. I suggest you do too.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.170
‐ oh, yeah. No, I know‐‐

16:39.165 --> 16:42.875
to Marissa h. I haven't heard
one bad thing about her, so...

16:42.877 --> 16:45.247
‐ me and her have a really
good rhythm with our kissing.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.339
Peace.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.131
Peace.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.934
Good‐bye.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.011
‐ so somebody saw. ‐ no‐‐

16:55.014 --> 16:57.064
‐ someone here has seen, so
we need to go up to people,

16:57.058 --> 16:58.848
and we have to get proof.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.901
‐ no, but Brandt said in the
closet not to tell anyone.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.515
He's gonna get mad. Please don't.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.521
‐ Maya, who cares?

17:05.524 --> 17:07.694
‐ okay. Okay, fine, okay.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.613
We're gonna go up to people.
We're gonna get proof.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.572
We're just not gonna let them
know everything that happened.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.622
We're not gonna give it all away.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.656
Me and Anna and Brandt
went into a closet.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.200
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened, okay?

17:18.204 --> 17:19.584
‐ I'll say a word, and you tell me

17:19.580 --> 17:22.830
the first thing that comes
to your mind‐‐loset.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.543
Deposit.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.633
‐ do you know who Brandt is? He
was just showing up a second ago.

17:26.629 --> 17:28.339
He had a butt cut and
he was saying hello.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.875
‐ mafoset.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.053
‐ and we basically hooked up.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.051
I'm not gonna say what it rhymes with,

17:33.052 --> 17:34.222
but it's second base.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.600
‐ you ever seen three people together?

17:36.597 --> 17:38.927
‐ we touched each other, but
on the chest, nothing else.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.773
And he said it didn't
happen, but it did.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.898
‐ you ever been to a dance? If
you say no, I don't believe you.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.975
‐ you bitch‐‐I know you're
lying to me right now.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.571
He went up and down, and
then he did circle motions.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.226
And then he did circle motions.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.284
Motion and a motion on the
boobies, you know what I mean?

17:50.278 --> 17:53.068
Maybe he does love me, 'cause he went
up and down a little bit more on me.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.662
I knew it. It's so weird.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.287
But then he said "I love you,"
and then I said I love you back

17:57.285 --> 17:58.325
and then now he's taking it back,

17:58.327 --> 17:59.447
and now I don't know what it means,

17:59.453 --> 18:00.663
and so I guess I'm just asking you

18:00.663 --> 18:01.753
'cause you're his best friend,

18:01.747 --> 18:03.117
like what does that mean?

18:03.124 --> 18:04.964
‐ you just told me, right?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.709
You should go talk to Brandt.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.171
‐ ca‐can you tell me where he is?

18:09.171 --> 18:10.591
‐ he's in my room.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.600
<i>From the start,</i>

18:19.599 --> 18:21.179
<i>clearly the aggressor on ziggo.</i>

18:21.183 --> 18:23.313
<i>Ziggo spinning and spinning...</i>

18:37.241 --> 18:38.991
‐

18:44.707 --> 18:46.247
Oh, hey.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.756
<i>There goes the ramp. The wheel is off.</i>

18:50.755 --> 18:52.505
<i>Oh!</i> <i>And now look at this.</i>

18:55.801 --> 18:57.261
‐ sup?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.981
Do you want me to leave? Be honest.

I still think you're,
like, pretty or whatever.

You were so desperate trying to
get Sam's attention all night.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.575
And then you had a
three‐some with Brandt,

22:48.576 --> 22:50.286
and that's fucked up.

You're crazy. ‐ okay, yeah, whatever.

Just thought you should know
that everyone is saying

23:13.475 --> 23:15.435
that you're desperate sluts.

23:15.436 --> 23:18.976
And what makes me really sad

23:18.981 --> 23:22.281
is that you've changed.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.896
Like, a lot.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.329
‐ didn't happen.

‐ yeah, Jenna, you don't know
what you're talking about!

I don't like her.

‐ I think that we all
change all the time

24:00.773 --> 24:02.693
and that that's just normal.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.111
‐ so you do! ‐ I don't
know how to answer this.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.739

‐ oh, my god. ‐ no, mostly good.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.080
It's just when we were
at the dance, like...

24:12.076 --> 24:15.656
You were, like, grinding with
just a few more people than me,

24:15.663 --> 24:17.873
and like when we were having the
fight, I looked across the gym

24:17.873 --> 24:21.093
and you were, like, three‐waying
kind of with Gabe and jafeer.

24:21.085 --> 24:24.625
‐ but so you're saying I had
two three‐ways that night?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.420
Did I have two threesomes that night?

24:26.423 --> 24:28.763
‐ you had two, but I had one.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.349
Like, who am I? ‐ so then I'm
more of a slut than you!

24:31.345 --> 24:33.005
That's what you're saying right now!

24:33.013 --> 24:35.023
‐ no, I'm saying if you
are, then I am too 'cause‐‐

24:35.015 --> 24:37.265
‐ no, you haven't changed.
You just did one.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.847
‐ no, I'm just saying
that we‐‐ ‐ oh, my god.

24:38.852 --> 24:42.822
‐ I get why people are
saying this about us.

24:44.733 --> 24:48.073
‐ so we're desperate sluts.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.990
Great.

24:49.989 --> 24:53.369
And now everyone knows and
Brandt's gonna be so mad.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.237
He's gonna hate us.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.754
‐ Brandt's a slut too. Ha.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.415
‐ no, he's just a player.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.508
‐ oh, yeah.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.508
He's just a player.
