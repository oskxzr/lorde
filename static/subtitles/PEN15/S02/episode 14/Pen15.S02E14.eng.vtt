00:14.348 --> 00:16.638
‐ Okay,
why do you keep doing that?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.394
‐ Um, they feel
like marshmallow.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.444
Think that's what happens
when you get your braces off.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.858
‐ Oh, my God, they look
so different.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.527
‐ Thanks.
‐ Do you, like, feel older?

00:26.526 --> 00:28.446
‐ Um, a little,
because this morning

00:28.445 --> 00:31.735
I woke up, and, like,
my boobs were a little bigger.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.948
‐ I mean...
‐ A little bit.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.662
‐ Like, they're huge.
Wow.

00:37.663 --> 00:38.713
‐ They're not huge, but
they're‐‐

00:38.705 --> 00:40.415
‐ No, they're huge.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.955
‐ Girls, uh, let's get
some furikake.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.459
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ I know.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.800
‐ Crazy.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.049
‐ Let's go.
‐ All right, let's go.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.468
Excuse me.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.876
Excuse me, miss.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.008
Hi.
‐ Hi.

00:55.013 --> 00:58.143
Wow, you're stunning.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.691
How tall are you?

00:59.685 --> 01:03.185
‐ Um, I'm 5'7 3/4".

01:03.188 --> 01:04.728
‐ You're a model.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.571
Anyone ever tell you that?

01:07.568 --> 01:10.648
Look at your legs.
So long.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.994
‐ Well, thank you.
Thank you.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.831
‐ I'm with Premier Models.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.696
I'd love to have you
come in and try out.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.417
‐ Are you serious?

01:25.419 --> 01:26.589
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah!

01:26.587 --> 01:27.917
‐ Thank you so much.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.461
‐ Here's all the info
for tomorrow.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.514
‐ Okay.
‐ Appointment time here.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.548
‐ Okay.
‐ Excellent.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.642
Looking forward
to seeing you tomorrow.

01:35.637 --> 01:36.807
‐ You too.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.104
‐ Oh, sorry, hi!
‐ Hi, sorry.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.600
Wait, what was that?

01:42.603 --> 01:43.603
What?

01:45.480 --> 01:46.480
Stop, what?

01:47.482 --> 01:48.862
‐ She just scouted me.

01:50.444 --> 01:54.034
To model.
‐ Oh, my God.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.321
‐ I just got scouted.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.159
‐ Mom, Anna's gonna be
a model.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.959
I am hiding

02:04.791 --> 02:11.381
The you I show to you
is just a lie

02:11.381 --> 02:14.381
You take what you want
you get what you take

02:14.384 --> 02:17.304
High, high, high

02:18.847 --> 02:20.427
I told you
a hundred times already,

02:20.432 --> 02:21.682
absolutely not.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.893
‐ Mom, like,
you're not listening, though.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.274
Please, like,
it's all the fashion hubs.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.231
It's New York,
Philadelphia, Tucson‐‐

02:28.231 --> 02:29.731
Like, it's all of them,
and then we can go.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.283
‐ Fine, how much and when?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.526
‐ I told you,
the appointment is today,

02:33.528 --> 02:35.108
and it's, like, 3,000 bucks.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.323
‐ No.
‐ Please, Mom.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.374
‐ I am not spending
this kind of money

02:39.368 --> 02:41.368
on this kind of thing.

02:41.370 --> 02:42.870
We shouldn't be paying them,

02:42.871 --> 02:44.751
they should be paying you!

02:44.748 --> 02:46.498
‐ You keep saying that.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.670
Not the good places.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.208
‐ I am done talking about this.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.551
‐ You don't get it at all.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.755
I've wanted to model
since I was literally born.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.796
Do I help‐‐
‐ Every sign points to a scam.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.221
And I didn't know
you've been wanting to do this

02:58.220 --> 02:59.300
since you were born.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.024
‐ Does a scam have
a pamphlet?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.765
So I don't know why
you keep saying that.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.687
Do you just think
I'm too ugly to model?

03:05.686 --> 03:08.896
‐ You already have
a freshman boyfriend, okay?

03:08.897 --> 03:10.317
And this is where
I draw the line.

03:10.315 --> 03:14.145
‐ Okay, well, the good news is,
is, you're not the boss.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.487
Ever think of that?
So I am calling Dad.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.659
‐ Great, call him.

03:18.657 --> 03:21.537
‐ 'Cause he's the real boss,
you bitch.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.905
‐ You're a bitch.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.961
‐ Oh, am I?
That's so mature.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.615
‐ You're the one
who is acting like a bitch.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.754
‐ Why do you talk to me
like that?

03:29.751 --> 03:32.051
‐ I'm the adult.
I know better.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.205
You're the kid.
Act like a kid.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.304
‐ Don't leave.
Don't leave.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.429
Mom!

03:38.510 --> 03:40.510
No, honestly Anna,
if you were my daughter,

03:40.512 --> 03:42.512
I would totally let you model.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.854
You've done
a runway show before,

03:43.849 --> 03:46.309
and you, like,
you wear hats so well.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.599
Yeah.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.652
They just, like, treat me
like a kid.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.806
Otherwise they're just, like,

03:50.814 --> 03:52.444
"Oh, do everything,
you're an adult."

03:52.441 --> 03:54.191
And then, like, they treat me
like a kid

03:54.192 --> 03:55.692
when it's convenient for them.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.574
Yeah, they're psychopaths.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.951
Like, you need
to get out of there.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.237
Like, I'm‐‐
I'm not kidding.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.412
‐ Can I sleep over?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.000
Yeah, definitely.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.285
Thanks.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.497
‐ When you come here,
I'm gonna, like,

04:08.498 --> 04:10.208
take pictures of you,
and I'm gonna prove

04:10.208 --> 04:11.748
that you're a model.
Like, you seriously

04:11.751 --> 04:13.251
are such a model.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.049
You're more beautiful.
‐ Okay, I gotta go.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.177
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay, love you, bye.

04:19.468 --> 04:20.638
‐ What?

04:20.635 --> 04:22.005
‐ Look what
Mom and Dad let me get.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.886
‐ What is that?

04:24.890 --> 04:27.600
‐ Nokia 3310.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.811
Oh, my God.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.812
‐ Cell phone, dummy.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.895
‐ Nokia 3310.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.155
‐ Strawberries.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.871
‐ It's got a calculator
and a stopwatch.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.331
So now I can time
how long it takes you

04:49.331 --> 04:50.371
to do something annoying.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.461
‐ Dank.
‐ Stop!

04:56.129 --> 04:58.129
Mom?
‐ Hmm?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.801
Do you have
a present for me?

05:00.801 --> 05:04.511
‐ Yeah, I got
the stains out for you.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.603
‐ Where's my cell phone?

05:06.598 --> 05:08.058
‐ Well, you're not
mature enough

05:08.058 --> 05:10.228
for a cell phone, Maya.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.597
‐ What are you even
talking about?

05:11.603 --> 05:12.773
Not mature enough?

05:12.771 --> 05:14.521
‐ You don't even know
how to wipe.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.693
‐ What are you even
talking about?

05:16.691 --> 05:18.821
I wipe fine, Mom.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.069
‐ 11 seconds.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.660
‐ Stop, Shuji.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.196
Mom, I'm so mature.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.779
Why don't I have
a cell phone?

05:25.784 --> 05:27.374
‐ When you're
in eighth grade,

05:27.369 --> 05:29.199
maybe you can have
your own.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.214
‐ Eighth gr‐‐
I'm, like,

05:30.205 --> 05:31.455
never gonna reach
eighth grade.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.536
What are you even
talking about?

05:33.542 --> 05:34.882
‐ Here's my number.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.206
You can call me...

05:36.211 --> 05:38.131
when you learn
how to wipe my butt.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.379
‐ Mom!
Shuji, stop.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.882
That's so unfair.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.683
‐ This is you being immature.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.048
‐ So you love him
more than me?

05:47.806 --> 05:50.766
Okay, I'm gonna run away.
‐ Okay.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.137
‐ So, you're okay with that?
That I'm running away?

05:53.144 --> 05:54.354
‐ Yeah.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.114
‐ Mom, you're okay
with me running away?

05:56.106 --> 05:57.976
I'm going to run away.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.653
‐ All right,
I'll see you later.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.361
‐ Oh, my God.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.741
Okay, so you're okay
with your daughter

06:03.738 --> 06:05.448
running away?

06:06.783 --> 06:09.743
Running away!
I hate you!

06:09.744 --> 06:11.414
Do you hear that, Mom?

06:11.413 --> 06:12.913
You're never gonna
see me again!

06:15.125 --> 06:16.955
I hate you!

06:16.960 --> 06:19.300
I'm gonna die
on the street!

06:25.594 --> 06:28.474
Mama, can you drive me
to Anna's first, though?

06:37.355 --> 06:39.315
Hello?

06:39.316 --> 06:40.316
It's Maya.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.567
‐ Mai?

06:43.570 --> 06:44.700
I thought I was coming to you.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.866
‐ I don't want
to be there anymore.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.485
Like‐‐

06:48.491 --> 06:50.621
What's wrong?

06:50.619 --> 06:52.909
My mom gave
Shuji a cell phone

06:52.912 --> 06:56.332
and said that I wasn't
mature enough for one.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.543
‐ Oh, my God,
that is insane, Mai.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.803
You're the most mature person
I've ever met.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.835
‐ I know.
That's what I said to her.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.930
‐ Yeah, yeah, I agree.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.553
‐ I just don't want
to be there anymore.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.224
I think we should run away.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.807
‐ Mai...
‐ I'm serious.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.689
‐ I know, but it's, like,
I want to be with you,

07:16.686 --> 07:17.766
of course I want
to be with you,

07:17.771 --> 07:18.981
but, like,
where are we gonna go,

07:18.980 --> 07:20.400
and, like, what
are we gonna eat?

07:20.398 --> 07:23.358
‐ Anna, you're gonna model.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.150
‐ Maya.
‐ I'm serious!

07:25.153 --> 07:26.823
Like, you make
tons of money from that,

07:26.821 --> 07:28.241
and that's, like,
what we spend.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.619
We can, like, spend it
on whatever.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.326
‐ Okay. Yeah.
‐ Yeah?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.537
‐ I mean,
I have to try out still.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.617
But I actually don't have
a parent's consent.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.003
‐ Then I sign it.
‐ Maya‐‐

07:39.000 --> 07:40.670
Please?

07:42.003 --> 07:44.803
‐ You really think
I could model?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.048
‐ You're gonna be a model.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.505
‐ Yeah.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.840
‐ My daughter's gonna be
a model.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.890
Please...
‐ Okay.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.891
‐ Really?
And I'll be your mom?

08:01.189 --> 08:04.479
Makeover!
‐ Oh, my God, stop.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.494
‐ Tickle, tickle, tickle.
‐ Okay, we're packing.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.113
‐ I love this.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.735
- Oh, my God.
- What?

08:12.742 --> 08:14.242
‐ Love.
‐ I wanna wear that.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.164
‐ Okay, but, like‐‐
‐ It's, like, silk.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.542
Yes!

08:17.539 --> 08:18.919
Yes.
‐ Look.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.665
Okay, Anna...

08:20.667 --> 08:21.997
‐ Love.
Love that.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.551
‐ Love, right?
‐ Love.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.255
‐ Okay, I'm gonna wear those.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.215
‐ These are like...that.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.465
‐ I want to wear those.
‐ Super low.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.716
‐ I want to wear those.
‐ Okay.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.548
‐ I love these.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.683
I'm just gonna leave
these options for my mom.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.850
‐ Okay.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.768
‐ And then
I'm gonna get some makeup,

08:36.766 --> 08:40.936
and, um, I'll go get ready.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.687
And don't go
in that drawer, though.

08:42.689 --> 08:43.979
‐ Why?

08:43.982 --> 08:46.572
‐ 'Cause my mom says not to.
I don't know why.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.738
‐ Okay.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.663
Ah.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.461
No, I'm your mom.
Mom.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.631
You go to get Maya‐‐

09:05.628 --> 09:08.168
I've gotta get
my giant pocketbook.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.803
Mm‐hmm.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.217
Mommy's drawer.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.443
‐ No, Daddy,
I'm, like‐‐I do love you.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.645
I was just gone
'cause I'm modeling now.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.607
I'm a model.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.697
I'm just kidding.
I'm still trying

09:37.702 --> 09:39.002
to get an agent.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.209
‐ Mine.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.842
Map.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.259
My map.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.547
This is my coin.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.010
This is just for adults, honey.
It's not for kids.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.643
Just gonna eat
my Thursday candy.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.431
This is my...

10:07.857 --> 10:08.977
Oh.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.445
Mm.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.538
It tickles.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.417
It's a massager.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.916
Okay, I got
so much good stuff.

10:31.798 --> 10:35.718
Oh, you look
so beautiful.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.348
‐ No, you do.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.595
‐ No, I don't.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.097
I'm ugly.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.429
‐ Mai.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.853
‐ No, it's okay.
I'm ugly.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.730
Kind of accepted it.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.940
It's actually kind of freeing.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.940
‐ Okay, that's not true.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.652
I don't know if all of this
is, like, the best idea.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.783
‐ Why?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.279
‐ Well, it's just, like,
I don't know.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.871
No, I'm so excited.
I'm, like‐‐

10:57.866 --> 10:59.156
I can't wait.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.659
Honestly, I'm just, like,
where are we gonna sleep?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.160
Or, like, what
are we gonna eat?

11:02.162 --> 11:04.462
And, like‐‐

11:04.455 --> 11:06.995
Oh, see, you always know
what I need.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.750
‐ No, I don't want
you to feel stressed.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.381
I think this is gonna be fun.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.668
‐ Yeah.

11:14.382 --> 11:18.222
I think I'm just stressed out
about leaving Daddy.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.139
‐ Well, why don't
we just bring Daddy?

11:21.139 --> 11:23.559
‐ You sure?
‐ Seriously.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.018
Daddy, Mommy, and model.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.898
‐ Maya.
‐ Stop, I'm serious.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.516
You're gonna be amazing.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.522
‐ Thanks.
‐ Listen to me.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.823
‐ Okay.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.896
‐ You're seriously gonna get
signed as a model,

11:33.902 --> 11:35.822
and we're gonna move
wherever we want,

11:35.820 --> 11:37.950
and we can get
whatever we want.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.237
‐ Maya.
‐ I'm serious.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.370
And call me "mommy."

11:42.243 --> 11:43.623
‐ Maya.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.660
‐ Call me "Mommy."

11:46.206 --> 11:47.666
‐ Okay, Mommy.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.137
‐ That's gonna be you now.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.636
‐ Maybe in a couple of years.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.181
Knock on wood.
Knock on wood.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.644
Next stop, Fifth and Krueger.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.774
‐ Okay, next stop.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.810
‐ Is that us?
‐ Hold on. Hold on.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.027
Okay, two stops.
Two stops.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.819
Here, you want a snack?

12:20.823 --> 12:24.083
‐ Oh, my God, Mom.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.617
Mom, thank you so much.
‐ You're welcome, honey.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.459
‐ Can I have more?
I'm a little hungry.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.787
‐ No, you have to watch
your figure.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.172
Little bites.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.429
‐ You look beautiful, girl.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.020
‐ Thank you.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.636
‐ I wonder if our parents
are wondering

12:48.643 --> 12:50.693
where we are right now,
like, freaking out.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.057
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Freaking out.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.984
‐ When my mom realizes
that I'm not sleeping

12:54.983 --> 12:57.743
over at your house,
she's gonna be, like,

12:57.735 --> 12:59.735
missing me.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.407
‐ I bet you mine are calling
the cops right now.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.906
Fred, we gotta plant
some flowers in the front.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.162
‐ I know, I know‐‐
Hey, you know, where's Maya?

13:10.164 --> 13:13.134
‐ She's at Anna's,
spending the night.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.126
‐ Ah, okay.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.997
‐ She's run away.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.134
‐ Good.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.420
'Cause she's the only one
that knows

13:18.423 --> 13:19.763
where the AC adapter is.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.426
Oh, my God.
Okay.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.227
See, I told my mom
this isn't a scam.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.979
‐ You're the only model here.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.362
‐ They must really like me,
I guess.

13:39.444 --> 13:40.824
‐ Okay.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.411
‐ Thanks, Mom.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.729
Okay, uh, Anna?

14:16.731 --> 14:18.781
‐ Yep, this is her.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.315
‐ Okay, great.
Come on back.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.779
‐ Just to the‐‐
wanna come?

14:23.780 --> 14:26.450
‐ Uh‐‐
‐ No, you're gonna go.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.659
‐ Sorry, how old are you?

14:28.659 --> 14:29.909
‐ She's‐‐
‐ 13.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.831
‐ 14.
I'm her mama.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.499
‐ Uh, okay.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.039
‐ And she's done
lots of runway before,

14:36.042 --> 14:37.212
so you can just‐‐

14:37.210 --> 14:39.250
‐ Okay, that's not really
a prerequisite.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.883
‐ And I just got
my braces off.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.920
‐ Okay.
‐ So...

14:41.923 --> 14:43.093
‐ A lot of people
come through here

14:43.091 --> 14:44.551
wanting to work
with Premier Models.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.220
So, you know,
we'll take a few pictures,

14:47.220 --> 14:50.100
see where you land,
and, uh, if it does work out,

14:50.098 --> 14:51.848
we will need payments,
$3,000.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.189
‐ That's good.
And I'm her parental consent.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.186
And I consent.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.977
‐ She signed it.
‐ It's signed.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.070
‐ As long as, uh‐‐

14:59.065 --> 15:00.105
as long as
the payment works out,

15:00.108 --> 15:01.148
then we should be good.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.440
So, uh, you ready
to come on back

15:02.443 --> 15:03.443
and give it a shot?

15:03.444 --> 15:04.704
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

15:04.695 --> 15:05.695
‐ Um‐‐
‐ Anna.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.203
‐ Uh, what cup size are you?

15:10.201 --> 15:11.911
‐ Cup size is a B.
‐ Okay, that'll work.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.501
Go ahead.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.536
Hi.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.593
‐ Ooh.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.928
Car report.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.307
Best and worst deals.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.520
‐ I don't know
why you're freaking out, Daddy.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.694
You're freaking me out.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.401
She's been in there
a long time, yeah.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.584
Ooh, I don't know.
I don't know.

16:32.575 --> 16:33.865
I think she's
been in there too long.

16:35.745 --> 16:36.995
Maybe I should go
check on her.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.167
Okay.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.875
Sorry, to‐‐Anna?

16:49.884 --> 16:50.934
Oh, my God.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.097
Um, we‐‐we gotta go.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.555
Daddy's outside, freaking out,
so I think we gotta go.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.266
‐ Did you give him food, Maya?
Just give him some food.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.726
‐ No, Daddy
at the police station

16:59.727 --> 17:02.187
has his shift wrong,
and done,

17:02.188 --> 17:04.188
and he has a gun
on a holster.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.690
And he said we gotta go.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.491
‐ He has a gun?
‐ He has a gun.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.565
‐ Oh, yeah, he does.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.819
‐ So put your shirt on.
‐ Okay.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.279
‐ Thank you.
Thank you.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.913
‐ But you‐‐
‐ Go, go, go.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.751
All right, give me those.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.211
Creepy.
Come on.

17:22.333 --> 17:25.633
Ugh, fucking weird.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.878
That was crazy.
That guy was, like‐‐

17:27.880 --> 17:29.800
I don't know.
I didn't like that.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.089
You were in,
like, someone's bikini.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.393
‐ Did I do something bad?
Was that bad?

17:34.387 --> 17:35.597
‐ No.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.216
No, you didn't do
anything bad.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.433
‐ Yeah, 'cause I know
it was weird,

17:38.432 --> 17:40.102
but that's what models do.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.521
So I'm just not ready to model.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.900
‐ Yeah, that's okay.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.106
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.361
It just was kind of crazy
what he did to you, like‐‐

17:51.362 --> 17:53.032
‐ It was my fault, though,
because he asked me

17:53.030 --> 17:54.700
if I like bikinis,
and I said yes.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.462
Where are we going?

18:11.340 --> 18:14.010
Home?
Or, um‐‐

18:14.010 --> 18:15.760
‐ I mean, if you want
to go home...

18:17.263 --> 18:18.723
‐ I'm not saying
I want to go home.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.853
I'm saying,
do you want to go home?

18:20.850 --> 18:23.100
‐ That's up to you.
‐ Yeah, I know.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.192
‐ Okay.
‐ Yeah, we don't need

18:24.186 --> 18:25.266
to go home.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.651
‐ So, we'll‐‐
We'll just stick‐‐

18:26.647 --> 18:28.187
‐ Right?
‐ Yeah! Let's do it.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.360
Let's just stick
to the plan.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.778
Like, I don't‐‐
I don't want to go home.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.237
I don't want to see them.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.527
‐ Yeah.
‐ Right now.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.570
‐ Same.

18:49.086 --> 18:53.796
‐ The bus stop was actually
on the other side.

18:59.722 --> 19:00.772
‐ Sorry.

19:29.126 --> 19:33.756
I wish I had someone
to call to give us a ride.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.506
‐ Well, that's why
my mom should've given me

19:35.508 --> 19:36.758
a cell phone.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.299
They really come in handy.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.512
‐ Where are we going?

19:41.514 --> 19:45.854
‐ Um, we're gonna go...

19:47.353 --> 19:49.613
‐ Maya, my arms are heavy.
‐ Yes, I know.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.395
I want to find
a place to rest.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.608
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ What?

19:54.610 --> 19:55.740
‐ Look!

19:58.781 --> 20:00.741
Oh, my God.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.491
He's so cute!

20:02.493 --> 20:04.123
You're so cute!

20:04.120 --> 20:05.160
‐ Hi!

20:05.162 --> 20:08.422
‐ Hi! I love you.
‐ Oh, my God, hi.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.576
Hi.
Yeah.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.094
His butt is so bushy.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.877
‐ What's your name, buddy?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.510
Your name, buddy?
‐ Let's call him Golden Butt.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.427
Golden Butt.
‐ I love it.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.229
‐ Should we put Daddy
on Golden Butt's head?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.938
‐ They could be animal buddies.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.403
Oh, yeah.
‐ Animal buddies.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.124
‐ So cute!
‐ So cute.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.485
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ There you go.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.202
‐ So cute.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.372
Oh, the animal buddies.
Oh!

20:47.371 --> 20:50.711
Oh, my God.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.128
‐ Hey! Drop it.
Drop it!

20:53.127 --> 20:55.917
Drop it!
Oh, God!

20:55.921 --> 20:56.921
Here, hold it.
‐ D'you think he's still alive?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.722
Drop.
Drop. Drop it.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.011
‐ Oh, my God.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.682
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, wait, wait, wait.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.770
Oh, look.
‐ Is he?

21:05.765 --> 21:06.805
‐ Look.
‐ It's‐‐

21:06.807 --> 21:07.927
‐ He's peeing.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.523
He's peeing.
Daddy is still alive.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.638
‐ Wait, but I can't‐‐

21:10.644 --> 21:12.154
‐ No, no, no,
Daddy's still alive.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.806
Look.
Look, look, look.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.534
He's alive!

21:20.154 --> 21:21.364
‐ No!

21:21.363 --> 21:22.363
Luther!

21:22.364 --> 21:23.824
Luther, come here, baby.

21:23.824 --> 21:26.044
Luther!

21:26.035 --> 21:27.695
Come on, baby.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.253
Hey, girls,
are you okay?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.498
‐ Your dog has my hamster.

21:33.501 --> 21:36.131
‐ Oh.
Bad Luther.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.798
No‐‐
Drop the rat.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.717
Oh, I'm so sorry, girls.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.256
Do you live
in the neighborhood?

21:42.259 --> 21:44.509
‐ No.
‐ No.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.852
‐ Well, do you want
to come inside

21:45.846 --> 21:47.926
and use my phone
to call your parents?

21:47.932 --> 21:49.232
‐ Um...

21:51.185 --> 21:53.305
‐ Okay, well come on in.
‐ Yeah, okay.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.692
‐ It's gonna be okay.
‐ You okay?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.908
I'm sorry about Daddy,
but I also don't think

22:05.908 --> 22:07.078
we should call our parents

22:07.076 --> 22:08.576
'cause they're gonna kill us,
okay?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.905
Who are you gonna call?

22:11.914 --> 22:13.084
I'm so, so, sorry,
girls.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.212
I'm really sorry.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.168
No, it's okay.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.627
‐ Well, come on inside.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.160
‐ I'm sorry, Daddy.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.999
‐ I'm sorry I was a bad mom.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.206
‐ No, you weren't.
I was.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.206
‐ It's my fault.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.552
I love you, Daddy.
‐ Love you, Daddy.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.115
‐ What's with all the shit?

23:38.292 --> 23:41.422
‐ You mean our stuff?
Like, we ran away.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.670
‐ Yeah.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.721
Like, our moms
are being assholes, so‐‐

23:44.715 --> 23:46.125
‐ Is that why
you two look like

23:46.133 --> 23:48.593
you got sand in your vaginas?

23:48.594 --> 23:54.064
‐ Um, Daddy just died,
so it's not funny.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.888
‐ Wait, what happened
to your dad?

23:55.893 --> 23:58.693
‐ Steven, Daddy?
My hamster?

23:58.687 --> 23:59.767
You know?
You don't listen.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.772
Like, he doesn't always listen.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.153
‐ No, I‐‐it's not‐‐it's‐‐

24:03.150 --> 24:05.440
he got, like, mauled
and chomped, and, like,

24:05.444 --> 24:07.404
bitten and eaten alive
and stuff.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.534
‐ Oh!

24:13.202 --> 24:15.372
‐ Let's, uh‐‐
let's do something fun

24:15.371 --> 24:17.501
to get your mind off Daddy.

24:17.498 --> 24:21.288
We can take a ride
into the moonlight

24:21.293 --> 24:23.713
and play some jams.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.092
‐ Okay, sure.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.550
‐ Sweet.

24:27.549 --> 24:30.049
‐ Um, do you have
your driver's license?

24:30.052 --> 24:31.432
‐ I've got
my brother's learner's permit.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.718
We look the same.
‐ Yeah.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.221
‐ And plus, we're not gonna
get pulled over.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.063
- That's stupid.
- No.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.598
First we gotta pick
a mix, though.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.441
You ever heard of this?

24:39.436 --> 24:41.516
"My Favorite Tunes,
Love Dad."

24:44.108 --> 24:45.398
‐ I love you.

24:45.401 --> 24:46.651
‐ I love you.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.372
‐ Dee, dee, dee.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.503
Um, love your car.

24:58.330 --> 25:03.290
‐ Mayor...Maya.
Let's all chill.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.212
‐ Okay.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.974
‐ Okay.

25:16.849 --> 25:21.809
California baby

25:21.812 --> 25:26.232
Caught my eye

25:28.652 --> 25:31.952
Lying on the beach

25:31.947 --> 25:35.577
While I surfed by

25:40.372 --> 25:43.082
Then when we met

25:43.083 --> 25:46.253
I'll never forget

25:46.253 --> 25:48.803
You were so tan

25:48.797 --> 25:51.967
And me in my van

25:51.967 --> 25:56.967
California baby

25:56.972 --> 26:01.732
By my side

26:03.812 --> 26:08.652
California baby

26:08.650 --> 26:11.990
Don't you cry

26:15.574 --> 26:20.294
I'll be right beside you

26:20.287 --> 26:22.407
Do or die
