1
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,638
‐ Okay,
why do you keep doing that?

2
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,394
‐ Um, they feel
like marshmallow.

3
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,444
Think that's what happens
when you get your braces off.

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,858
‐ Oh, my God, they look
so different.

5
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,527
‐ Thanks.
‐ Do you, like, feel older?

6
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,446
‐ Um, a little,
because this morning

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,735
I woke up, and, like,
my boobs were a little bigger.

8
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,948
‐ I mean...
‐ A little bit.

9
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,662
‐ Like, they're huge.
Wow.

10
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:38,713
‐ They're not huge, but
they're‐‐

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,415
‐ No, they're huge.

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,955
‐ Girls, uh, let's get
some furikake.

13
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,459
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ I know.

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,800
‐ Crazy.

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,049
‐ Let's go.
‐ All right, let's go.

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,468
Excuse me.

17
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,876
Excuse me, miss.

18
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,008
Hi.
‐ Hi.

19
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,143
Wow, you're stunning.

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,691
How tall are you?

21
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,185
‐ Um, I'm 5'7 3/4".

22
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,728
‐ You're a model.

23
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,571
Anyone ever tell you that?

24
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,648
Look at your legs.
So long.

25
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,994
‐ Well, thank you.
Thank you.

26
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,831
‐ I'm with Premier Models.

27
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,696
I'd love to have you
come in and try out.

28
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,417
‐ Are you serious?

29
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,589
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah!

30
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,917
‐ Thank you so much.

31
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,461
‐ Here's all the info
for tomorrow.

32
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,514
‐ Okay.
‐ Appointment time here.

33
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,548
‐ Okay.
‐ Excellent.

34
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,642
Looking forward
to seeing you tomorrow.

35
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,807
‐ You too.

36
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,104
‐ Oh, sorry, hi!
‐ Hi, sorry.

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,600
Wait, what was that?

38
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,603
What?

39
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Stop, what?

40
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,862
‐ She just scouted me.

41
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,034
To model.
‐ Oh, my God.

42
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,321
‐ I just got scouted.

43
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,159
‐ Mom, Anna's gonna be
a model.

44
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,959
I am hiding

45
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:11,381
The you I show to you
is just a lie

46
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,381
You take what you want
you get what you take

47
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,304
High, high, high

48
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,427
I told you
a hundred times already,

49
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,682
absolutely not.

50
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,893
‐ Mom, like,
you're not listening, though.

51
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,274
Please, like,
it's all the fashion hubs.

52
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,231
It's New York,
Philadelphia, Tucson‐‐

53
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,731
Like, it's all of them,
and then we can go.

54
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,283
‐ Fine, how much and when?

55
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,526
‐ I told you,
the appointment is today,

56
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,108
and it's, like, 3,000 bucks.

57
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,323
‐ No.
‐ Please, Mom.

58
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,374
‐ I am not spending
this kind of money

59
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,368
on this kind of thing.

60
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,870
We shouldn't be paying them,

61
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,751
they should be paying you!

62
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,498
‐ You keep saying that.

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,670
Not the good places.

64
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,208
‐ I am done talking about this.

65
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,551
‐ You don't get it at all.

66
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,755
I've wanted to model
since I was literally born.

67
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,796
Do I help‐‐
‐ Every sign points to a scam.

68
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,221
And I didn't know
you've been wanting to do this

69
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,300
since you were born.

70
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,024
‐ Does a scam have
a pamphlet?

71
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,765
So I don't know why
you keep saying that.

72
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,687
Do you just think
I'm too ugly to model?

73
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,896
‐ You already have
a freshman boyfriend, okay?

74
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,317
And this is where
I draw the line.

75
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,145
‐ Okay, well, the good news is,
is, you're not the boss.

76
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,487
Ever think of that?
So I am calling Dad.

77
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,659
‐ Great, call him.

78
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,537
‐ 'Cause he's the real boss,
you bitch.

79
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,905
‐ You're a bitch.

80
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,961
‐ Oh, am I?
That's so mature.

81
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,615
‐ You're the one
who is acting like a bitch.

82
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,754
‐ Why do you talk to me
like that?

83
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,051
‐ I'm the adult.
I know better.

84
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,205
You're the kid.
Act like a kid.

85
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,304
‐ Don't leave.
Don't leave.

86
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,429
Mom!

87
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,510
No, honestly Anna,
if you were my daughter,

88
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,512
I would totally let you model.

89
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,854
You've done
a runway show before,

90
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,309
and you, like,
you wear hats so well.

91
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,599
Yeah.

92
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,652
They just, like, treat me
like a kid.

93
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,806
Otherwise they're just, like,

94
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,444
"Oh, do everything,
you're an adult."

95
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,191
And then, like, they treat me
like a kid

96
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,692
when it's convenient for them.

97
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,574
Yeah, they're psychopaths.

98
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,951
Like, you need
to get out of there.

99
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,237
Like, I'm‐‐
I'm not kidding.

100
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,412
‐ Can I sleep over?

101
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, definitely.

102
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,285
Thanks.

103
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,497
‐ When you come here,
I'm gonna, like,

104
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,208
take pictures of you,
and I'm gonna prove

105
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,748
that you're a model.
Like, you seriously

106
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,251
are such a model.

107
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,049
You're more beautiful.
‐ Okay, I gotta go.

108
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,177
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay, love you, bye.

109
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,638
‐ What?

110
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,005
‐ Look what
Mom and Dad let me get.

111
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,886
‐ What is that?

112
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,600
‐ Nokia 3310.

113
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,811
Oh, my God.

114
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,812
‐ Cell phone, dummy.

115
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,895
‐ Nokia 3310.

116
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,155
‐ Strawberries.

117
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,871
‐ It's got a calculator
and a stopwatch.

118
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,331
So now I can time
how long it takes you

119
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,371
to do something annoying.

120
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,461
‐ Dank.
‐ Stop!

121
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,129
Mom?
‐ Hmm?

122
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,801
Do you have
a present for me?

123
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,511
‐ Yeah, I got
the stains out for you.

124
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,603
‐ Where's my cell phone?

125
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,058
‐ Well, you're not
mature enough

126
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,228
for a cell phone, Maya.

127
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,597
‐ What are you even
talking about?

128
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,773
Not mature enough?

129
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,521
‐ You don't even know
how to wipe.

130
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,693
‐ What are you even
talking about?

131
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,821
I wipe fine, Mom.

132
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,069
‐ 11 seconds.

133
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,660
‐ Stop, Shuji.

134
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,196
Mom, I'm so mature.

135
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,779
Why don't I have
a cell phone?

136
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,374
‐ When you're
in eighth grade,

137
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,199
maybe you can have
your own.

138
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,214
‐ Eighth gr‐‐
I'm, like,

139
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,455
never gonna reach
eighth grade.

140
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,536
What are you even
talking about?

141
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,882
‐ Here's my number.

142
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,206
You can call me...

143
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,131
when you learn
how to wipe my butt.

144
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,379
‐ Mom!
Shuji, stop.

145
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,882
That's so unfair.

146
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,683
‐ This is you being immature.

147
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,048
‐ So you love him
more than me?

148
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,766
Okay, I'm gonna run away.
‐ Okay.

149
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,137
‐ So, you're okay with that?
That I'm running away?

150
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,354
‐ Yeah.

151
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,114
‐ Mom, you're okay
with me running away?

152
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,976
I'm going to run away.

153
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,653
‐ All right,
I'll see you later.

154
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,361
‐ Oh, my God.

155
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,741
Okay, so you're okay
with your daughter

156
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,448
running away?

157
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,743
Running away!
I hate you!

158
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,414
Do you hear that, Mom?

159
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,913
You're never gonna
see me again!

160
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,955
I hate you!

161
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,300
I'm gonna die
on the street!

162
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,474
Mama, can you drive me
to Anna's first, though?

163
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,315
Hello?

164
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,316
It's Maya.

165
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,567
‐ Mai?

166
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,700
I thought I was coming to you.

167
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,866
‐ I don't want
to be there anymore.

168
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,485
Like‐‐

169
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,621
What's wrong?

170
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,909
My mom gave
Shuji a cell phone

171
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,332
and said that I wasn't
mature enough for one.

172
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,543
‐ Oh, my God,
that is insane, Mai.

173
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,803
You're the most mature person
I've ever met.

174
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,835
‐ I know.
That's what I said to her.

175
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,930
‐ Yeah, yeah, I agree.

176
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,553
‐ I just don't want
to be there anymore.

177
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,224
I think we should run away.

178
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,807
‐ Mai...
‐ I'm serious.

179
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,689
‐ I know, but it's, like,
I want to be with you,

180
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,766
of course I want
to be with you,

181
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,981
but, like,
where are we gonna go,

182
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,400
and, like, what
are we gonna eat?

183
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,358
‐ Anna, you're gonna model.

184
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,150
‐ Maya.
‐ I'm serious!

185
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,823
Like, you make
tons of money from that,

186
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,241
and that's, like,
what we spend.

187
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,619
We can, like, spend it
on whatever.

188
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,326
‐ Okay. Yeah.
‐ Yeah?

189
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,537
‐ I mean,
I have to try out still.

190
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,617
But I actually don't have
a parent's consent.

191
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,003
‐ Then I sign it.
‐ Maya‐‐

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,670
Please?

193
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,803
‐ You really think
I could model?

194
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,048
‐ You're gonna be a model.

195
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,505
‐ Yeah.

196
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,840
‐ My daughter's gonna be
a model.

197
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,890
Please...
‐ Okay.

198
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,891
‐ Really?
And I'll be your mom?

199
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,479
Makeover!
‐ Oh, my God, stop.

200
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,494
‐ Tickle, tickle, tickle.
‐ Okay, we're packing.

201
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,113
‐ I love this.

202
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,735
- Oh, my God.
- What?

203
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,242
‐ Love.
‐ I wanna wear that.

204
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,164
‐ Okay, but, like‐‐
‐ It's, like, silk.

205
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,542
Yes!

206
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,919
Yes.
‐ Look.

207
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,665
Okay, Anna...

208
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,997
‐ Love.
Love that.

209
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,551
‐ Love, right?
‐ Love.

210
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,255
‐ Okay, I'm gonna wear those.

211
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,215
‐ These are like...that.

212
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,465
‐ I want to wear those.
‐ Super low.

213
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,716
‐ I want to wear those.
‐ Okay.

214
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,548
‐ I love these.

215
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,683
I'm just gonna leave
these options for my mom.

216
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,850
‐ Okay.

217
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,768
‐ And then
I'm gonna get some makeup,

218
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,936
and, um, I'll go get ready.

219
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,687
And don't go
in that drawer, though.

220
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,979
‐ Why?

221
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,572
‐ 'Cause my mom says not to.
I don't know why.

222
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,738
‐ Okay.

223
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,663
Ah.

224
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,461
No, I'm your mom.
Mom.

225
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,631
You go to get Maya‐‐

226
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,168
I've gotta get
my giant pocketbook.

227
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,803
Mm‐hmm.

228
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,217
Mommy's drawer.

229
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,443
‐ No, Daddy,
I'm, like‐‐I do love you.

230
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,645
I was just gone
'cause I'm modeling now.

231
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,607
I'm a model.

232
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,697
I'm just kidding.
I'm still trying

233
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,002
to get an agent.

234
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,209
‐ Mine.

235
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,842
Map.

236
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,259
My map.

237
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,547
This is my coin.

238
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,010
This is just for adults, honey.
It's not for kids.

239
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,643
Just gonna eat
my Thursday candy.

240
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,431
This is my...

241
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,977
Oh.

242
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,445
Mm.

243
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,538
It tickles.

244
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,417
It's a massager.

245
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,916
Okay, I got
so much good stuff.

246
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,718
Oh, you look
so beautiful.

247
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,348
‐ No, you do.

248
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,595
‐ No, I don't.

249
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,097
I'm ugly.

250
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,429
‐ Mai.

251
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,853
‐ No, it's okay.
I'm ugly.

252
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,730
Kind of accepted it.

253
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,940
It's actually kind of freeing.

254
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,940
‐ Okay, that's not true.

255
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,652
I don't know if all of this
is, like, the best idea.

256
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,783
‐ Why?

257
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,279
‐ Well, it's just, like,
I don't know.

258
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,871
No, I'm so excited.
I'm, like‐‐

259
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,156
I can't wait.

260
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,659
Honestly, I'm just, like,
where are we gonna sleep?

261
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,160
Or, like, what
are we gonna eat?

262
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,462
And, like‐‐

263
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,995
Oh, see, you always know
what I need.

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,750
‐ No, I don't want
you to feel stressed.

265
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,381
I think this is gonna be fun.

266
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,668
‐ Yeah.

267
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,222
I think I'm just stressed out
about leaving Daddy.

268
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,139
‐ Well, why don't
we just bring Daddy?

269
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,559
‐ You sure?
‐ Seriously.

270
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,018
Daddy, Mommy, and model.

271
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,898
‐ Maya.
‐ Stop, I'm serious.

272
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,516
You're gonna be amazing.

273
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,522
‐ Thanks.
‐ Listen to me.

274
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,823
‐ Okay.

275
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,896
‐ You're seriously gonna get
signed as a model,

276
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,822
and we're gonna move
wherever we want,

277
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,950
and we can get
whatever we want.

278
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,237
‐ Maya.
‐ I'm serious.

279
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,370
And call me "mommy."

280
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,623
‐ Maya.

281
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,660
‐ Call me "Mommy."

282
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,666
‐ Okay, Mommy.

283
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,137
‐ That's gonna be you now.

284
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,636
‐ Maybe in a couple of years.

285
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,181
Knock on wood.
Knock on wood.

286
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,644
Next stop, Fifth and Krueger.

287
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,774
‐ Okay, next stop.

288
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,810
‐ Is that us?
‐ Hold on. Hold on.

289
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,027
Okay, two stops.
Two stops.

290
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,819
Here, you want a snack?

291
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,083
‐ Oh, my God, Mom.

292
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,617
Mom, thank you so much.
‐ You're welcome, honey.

293
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,459
‐ Can I have more?
I'm a little hungry.

294
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,787
‐ No, you have to watch
your figure.

295
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,172
Little bites.

296
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,429
‐ You look beautiful, girl.

297
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,020
‐ Thank you.

298
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,636
‐ I wonder if our parents
are wondering

299
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,693
where we are right now,
like, freaking out.

300
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,057
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Freaking out.

301
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,984
‐ When my mom realizes
that I'm not sleeping

302
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,743
over at your house,
she's gonna be, like,

303
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,735
missing me.

304
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,407
‐ I bet you mine are calling
the cops right now.

305
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,906
Fred, we gotta plant
some flowers in the front.

306
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,162
‐ I know, I know‐‐
Hey, you know, where's Maya?

307
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,134
‐ She's at Anna's,
spending the night.

308
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,126
‐ Ah, okay.

309
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,997
‐ She's run away.

310
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,134
‐ Good.

311
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,420
'Cause she's the only one
that knows

312
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,763
where the AC adapter is.

313
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,426
Oh, my God.
Okay.

314
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,227
See, I told my mom
this isn't a scam.

315
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,979
‐ You're the only model here.

316
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,362
‐ They must really like me,
I guess.

317
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,824
‐ Okay.

318
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,411
‐ Thanks, Mom.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

319
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,729
Okay, uh, Anna?

320
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,781
‐ Yep, this is her.

321
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,315
‐ Okay, great.
Come on back.

322
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,779
‐ Just to the‐‐
wanna come?

323
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,450
‐ Uh‐‐
‐ No, you're gonna go.

324
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,659
‐ Sorry, how old are you?

325
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,909
‐ She's‐‐
‐ 13.

326
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,831
‐ 14.
I'm her mama.

327
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,499
‐ Uh, okay.

328
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,039
‐ And she's done
lots of runway before,

329
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,212
so you can just‐‐

330
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,250
‐ Okay, that's not really
a prerequisite.

331
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,883
‐ And I just got
my braces off.

332
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,920
‐ Okay.
‐ So...

333
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,093
‐ A lot of people
come through here

334
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,551
wanting to work
with Premier Models.

335
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,220
So, you know,
we'll take a few pictures,

336
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,100
see where you land,
and, uh, if it does work out,

337
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,848
we will need payments,
$3,000.

338
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,189
‐ That's good.
And I'm her parental consent.

339
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,186
And I consent.

340
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,977
‐ She signed it.
‐ It's signed.

341
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,070
‐ As long as, uh‐‐

342
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,105
as long as
the payment works out,

343
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,148
then we should be good.

344
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,440
So, uh, you ready
to come on back

345
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,443
and give it a shot?

346
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,704
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

347
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,695
‐ Um‐‐
‐ Anna.

348
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,203
‐ Uh, what cup size are you?

349
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,911
‐ Cup size is a B.
‐ Okay, that'll work.

350
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,501
Go ahead.

351
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,536
Hi.

352
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,593
‐ Ooh.

353
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,928
Car report.

354
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,307
Best and worst deals.

355
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,520
‐ I don't know
why you're freaking out, Daddy.

356
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,694
You're freaking me out.

357
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,401
She's been in there
a long time, yeah.

358
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,584
Ooh, I don't know.
I don't know.

359
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,865
I think she's
been in there too long.

360
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,995
Maybe I should go
check on her.

361
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,167
Okay.

362
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,875
Sorry, to‐‐Anna?

363
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:50,934
Oh, my God.

364
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,097
Um, we‐‐we gotta go.

365
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,555
Daddy's outside, freaking out,
so I think we gotta go.

366
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,266
‐ Did you give him food, Maya?
Just give him some food.

367
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,726
‐ No, Daddy
at the police station

368
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,187
has his shift wrong,
and done,

369
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,188
and he has a gun
on a holster.

370
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,690
And he said we gotta go.

371
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,491
‐ He has a gun?
‐ He has a gun.

372
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,565
‐ Oh, yeah, he does.

373
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,819
‐ So put your shirt on.
‐ Okay.

374
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,279
‐ Thank you.
Thank you.

375
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,913
‐ But you‐‐
‐ Go, go, go.

376
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,751
All right, give me those.

377
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,211
Creepy.
Come on.

378
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,633
Ugh, fucking weird.

379
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,878
That was crazy.
That guy was, like‐‐

380
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,800
I don't know.
I didn't like that.

381
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,089
You were in,
like, someone's bikini.

382
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,393
‐ Did I do something bad?
Was that bad?

383
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,597
‐ No.

384
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,216
No, you didn't do
anything bad.

385
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,433
‐ Yeah, 'cause I know
it was weird,

386
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,102
but that's what models do.

387
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,521
So I'm just not ready to model.

388
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,900
‐ Yeah, that's okay.

389
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,106
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

390
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,361
It just was kind of crazy
what he did to you, like‐‐

391
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,032
‐ It was my fault, though,
because he asked me

392
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,700
if I like bikinis,
and I said yes.

393
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,462
Where are we going?

394
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,010
Home?
Or, um‐‐

395
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,760
‐ I mean, if you want
to go home...

396
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,723
‐ I'm not saying
I want to go home.

397
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,853
I'm saying,
do you want to go home?

398
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,100
‐ That's up to you.
‐ Yeah, I know.

399
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,192
‐ Okay.
‐ Yeah, we don't need

400
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,266
to go home.

401
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,651
‐ So, we'll‐‐
We'll just stick‐‐

402
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,187
‐ Right?
‐ Yeah! Let's do it.

403
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,360
Let's just stick
to the plan.

404
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,778
Like, I don't‐‐
I don't want to go home.

405
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,237
I don't want to see them.

406
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,527
‐ Yeah.
‐ Right now.

407
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,570
‐ Same.

408
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,796
‐ The bus stop was actually
on the other side.

409
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,772
‐ Sorry.

410
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,756
I wish I had someone
to call to give us a ride.

411
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,506
‐ Well, that's why
my mom should've given me

412
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,758
a cell phone.

413
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,299
They really come in handy.

414
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,512
‐ Where are we going?

415
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,854
‐ Um, we're gonna go...

416
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,613
‐ Maya, my arms are heavy.
‐ Yes, I know.

417
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,395
I want to find
a place to rest.

418
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,608
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ What?

419
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,740
‐ Look!

420
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,741
Oh, my God.

421
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,491
He's so cute!

422
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,123
You're so cute!

423
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,160
‐ Hi!

424
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,422
‐ Hi! I love you.
‐ Oh, my God, hi.

425
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,576
Hi.
Yeah.

426
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,094
His butt is so bushy.

427
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,877
‐ What's your name, buddy?

428
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,510
Your name, buddy?
‐ Let's call him Golden Butt.

429
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,427
Golden Butt.
‐ I love it.

430
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,229
‐ Should we put Daddy
on Golden Butt's head?

431
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,938
‐ They could be animal buddies.

432
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,403
Oh, yeah.
‐ Animal buddies.

433
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,124
‐ So cute!
‐ So cute.

434
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,485
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ There you go.

435
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,202
‐ So cute.

436
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,372
Oh, the animal buddies.
Oh!

437
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,711
Oh, my God.

438
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,128
‐ Hey! Drop it.
Drop it!

439
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,917
Drop it!
Oh, God!

440
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,921
Here, hold it.
‐ D'you think he's still alive?

441
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,722
Drop.
Drop. Drop it.

442
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,011
‐ Oh, my God.

443
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,682
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, wait, wait, wait.

444
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,770
Oh, look.
‐ Is he?

445
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,805
‐ Look.
‐ It's‐‐

446
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,927
‐ He's peeing.

447
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,523
He's peeing.
Daddy is still alive.

448
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,638
‐ Wait, but I can't‐‐

449
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,154
‐ No, no, no,
Daddy's still alive.

450
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,806
Look.
Look, look, look.

451
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,534
He's alive!

452
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,364
‐ No!

453
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,363
Luther!

454
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,824
Luther, come here, baby.

455
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,044
Luther!

456
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,695
Come on, baby.

457
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,253
Hey, girls,
are you okay?

458
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,498
‐ Your dog has my hamster.

459
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,131
‐ Oh.
Bad Luther.

460
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,798
No‐‐
Drop the rat.

461
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,717
Oh, I'm so sorry, girls.

462
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,256
Do you live
in the neighborhood?

463
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,509
‐ No.
‐ No.

464
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,852
‐ Well, do you want
to come inside

465
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,926
and use my phone
to call your parents?

466
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,232
‐ Um...

467
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,305
‐ Okay, well come on in.
‐ Yeah, okay.

468
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,692
‐ It's gonna be okay.
‐ You okay?

469
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,908
I'm sorry about Daddy,
but I also don't think

470
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,078
we should call our parents

471
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,576
'cause they're gonna kill us,
okay?

472
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,905
Who are you gonna call?

473
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,084
I'm so, so, sorry,
girls.

474
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,212
I'm really sorry.

475
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,168
No, it's okay.

476
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,627
‐ Well, come on inside.

477
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,160
‐ I'm sorry, Daddy.

478
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,999
‐ I'm sorry I was a bad mom.

479
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,206
‐ No, you weren't.
I was.

480
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,206
‐ It's my fault.

481
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,552
I love you, Daddy.
‐ Love you, Daddy.

482
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,115
‐ What's with all the shit?

483
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,422
‐ You mean our stuff?
Like, we ran away.

484
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,670
‐ Yeah.

485
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,721
Like, our moms
are being assholes, so‐‐

486
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,125
‐ Is that why
you two look like

487
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,593
you got sand in your vaginas?

488
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:54,064
‐ Um, Daddy just died,
so it's not funny.

489
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,888
‐ Wait, what happened
to your dad?

490
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,693
‐ Steven, Daddy?
My hamster?

491
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,767
You know?
You don't listen.

492
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:00,772
Like, he doesn't always listen.

493
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,153
‐ No, I‐‐it's not‐‐it's‐‐

494
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,440
he got, like, mauled
and chomped, and, like,

495
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,404
bitten and eaten alive
and stuff.

496
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,534
‐ Oh!

497
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,372
‐ Let's, uh‐‐
let's do something fun

498
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,501
to get your mind off Daddy.

499
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:21,288
We can take a ride
into the moonlight

500
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,713
and play some jams.

501
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,092
‐ Okay, sure.

502
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,550
‐ Sweet.

503
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,049
‐ Um, do you have
your driver's license?

504
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,432
‐ I've got
my brother's learner's permit.

505
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,718
We look the same.
‐ Yeah.

506
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,221
‐ And plus, we're not gonna
get pulled over.

507
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,063
- That's stupid.
- No.

508
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,598
First we gotta pick
a mix, though.

509
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,441
You ever heard of this?

510
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,516
"My Favorite Tunes,
Love Dad."

511
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,398
‐ I love you.

512
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,651
‐ I love you.

513
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,372
‐ Dee, dee, dee.

514
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,503
Um, love your car.

515
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:03,290
‐ Mayor...Maya.
Let's all chill.

516
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,212
‐ Okay.

517
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,974
‐ Okay.

518
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:21,809
California baby

519
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:26,232
Caught my eye

520
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,952
Lying on the beach

521
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,577
While I surfed by

522
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,082
Then when we met

523
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,253
I'll never forget

524
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,803
You were so tan

525
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,967
And me in my van

526
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,967
California baby

527
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:01,732
By my side

528
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:08,652
