01:00.705 --> 01:03.753
I want the house to be really clean
when we come home.

01:03.836 --> 01:06.550
Jesus, Kathy. This is so freakin' heavy.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.888
- What do you have in here? God!
- No, no, no. Don't. No.

01:08.971 --> 01:12.520
Why in the hell
are we taking rocks to the retreat?

01:12.604 --> 01:13.915
- They are crystals, all right?
- Yeah, bu...

01:13.939 --> 01:15.209
And we need them for the meditations.

01:15.233 --> 01:17.697
- Says who?
- What is this retreat for?

01:17.781 --> 01:20.178
Well, it's because your dad and I
haven't been getting along.

01:20.202 --> 01:21.765
Well, you probably weren't aware of that.

01:21.789 --> 01:24.251
Yeah, she... she knows, Kathy,

01:24.335 --> 01:26.815
- because we are fighting right now.
- No, we are not fighting.

01:26.882 --> 01:29.095
Is this thing for you guys
to get along better?

01:29.178 --> 01:30.263
Yeah, that's the plan.

01:30.347 --> 01:32.894
OK. Well, I really gonna miss

on the couch anymore.

a lot less from now on.

09:23.375 --> 09:24.503
Let's just not practice.

09:24.795 --> 09:26.214
I am gonna talk to my boyfriend.

09:26.340 --> 09:27.843
Can I have some privacy.

09:29.262 --> 09:30.849
- Please.
- Who's that?

09:32.226 --> 09:33.226
What?

09:34.272 --> 09:35.609
Who is your boyfriend?

09:37.613 --> 09:38.907
It's Flymiamibro.

09:39.992 --> 09:42.455
Like, I have talked about him

09:42.539 --> 09:43.457
- constantly.
- No, I know.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.587
I didn't know it was official.
It's official now?

09:46.421 --> 09:49.236
Haven't been able to talk to him
since however many days you have been here

09:49.260 --> 09:51.784
- 'cause there hasn't been time, but...
- All right, fine, whatever.

09:51.808 --> 09:52.808
OK. Whatever!

09:55.481 --> 09:58.153
To be honest,
my mom usually uses canned tomatoes

09:58.237 --> 09:59.949
- so I have not really done this.
- Oh.

10:00.449 --> 10:01.828
Like this?

10:02.036 --> 10:03.540
- Or like...
- Like that.

10:03.623 --> 10:04.875
Yeah, yeah...

10:04.959 --> 10:07.130
Very good, Anna. You're natural.

10:07.296 --> 10:09.635
- Is that thin enough?
- Yes, yes, yes.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.304
- Thanks.
- Good.

10:12.975 --> 10:14.102
What are you guys doing?

10:14.770 --> 10:16.374
- Slice them a little bit thinner.
- Yeah.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.233
I can help.

10:17.275 --> 10:19.112
- Here, I'll... give me one.
- Be careful.

10:19.404 --> 10:20.907
Shh... Ouch. Ow.

10:21.826 --> 10:24.372
That's actually different
than your mom wants it to be cut.

10:24.414 --> 10:27.378
I know how my mom
wants her tomatoes cut, Anna.

10:27.921 --> 10:30.134
- Th-that's...
- That works.

10:30.259 --> 10:33.474
N... Not really. It looks... ugh.

10:34.727 --> 10:37.023
- If you can't use that then you can't use...
- Maya.

10:37.106 --> 10:39.402
Anything. I don't really understand.

10:39.904 --> 10:42.158
- Shh...
- Sorry, she's so silly.

10:42.868 --> 10:43.868
She's...

10:44.622 --> 10:45.622
OK.

10:45.957 --> 10:47.878
What do I do with the end slice?

10:48.086 --> 10:49.086
Oh, eat it.

10:49.757 --> 10:50.757
Eat it.

10:50.801 --> 10:51.801
It's OK.

10:52.805 --> 10:54.390
- Mmm.
- Yum?

10:54.474 --> 10:55.602
Mm-hmm.

10:56.186 --> 10:57.898
She kinda puts it to her nose...

10:58.106 --> 10:59.819
and smells it and goes,

10:59.985 --> 11:02.950
"A female raccoon
has been living in my helmet."

11:04.995 --> 11:05.995
So...

11:06.122 --> 11:07.122
It's like...

11:07.166 --> 11:09.295
What are you talking about?

11:09.630 --> 11:10.924
I was like, "What?"

11:12.385 --> 11:13.513
She'd know that.

11:16.393 --> 11:18.857
It's not that funny, you guys.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.819
It's hilarious, no, come on.

11:21.152 --> 11:22.614
So... does your dad sing?

11:23.490 --> 11:25.244
He does. He's a very good singer.

11:25.327 --> 11:28.208
And my mom can't hold a...
can't hold a note,

11:28.292 --> 11:29.419
very tone deaf.

11:29.460 --> 11:32.383
- Well, you are really a great singer.
- Hmm.

11:32.466 --> 11:33.595
Thank you.

11:33.970 --> 11:35.389
I sing too, Dad.

11:35.932 --> 11:36.994
Yeah, I know... I know, honey.

11:37.018 --> 11:39.982
But, um, you are interested
in scatting too, right?

11:40.065 --> 11:41.569
I like it, but...

11:41.652 --> 11:42.779
I don't wanna know if I am

12:16.388 --> 12:17.975
♪ <i>I am flying now...</i> ♪

12:18.100 --> 12:21.691
♪ <i>I have a little cape
'Cause I fly real high</i> ♪

12:25.155 --> 12:26.867
I think you are just hurting our ears.

12:27.493 --> 12:29.122
Um, can I just use your phone?

12:29.163 --> 12:31.352
'Cause I just remembered I need to call
my parents to check in.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.064
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, we are not allowed to use the phone

12:33.088 --> 12:34.298
during dinner.

12:34.382 --> 12:35.259
- Oh, OK. Sorry.
- Yeah.

12:35.342 --> 12:37.639
No, it's OK. Anna is a guest so it's OK.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.977
- So go ahead, call your parents.
- It's fine.

12:40.436 --> 12:41.731
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

12:44.737 --> 12:47.199
Never in the 13 years
that I have been living

12:47.283 --> 12:49.096
have you ever let me
use the phone during dinner.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.374
She's a guest, it's OK.

12:52.502 --> 12:53.588
Bullshit.

12:53.671 --> 12:54.671
What?

12:55.132 --> 12:56.510
What did you say?

12:57.053 --> 12:58.053
Nothing.

12:58.848 --> 13:01.771
I just... what I said is "bullshay."

13:03.315 --> 13:04.233
No, you didn't.

13:04.275 --> 13:05.570
Yes, I did.

13:06.488 --> 13:07.488
Fuck you.

13:08.743 --> 13:09.912
Maya, go to your room.

13:10.037 --> 13:11.707
- No.
- Go to your room.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.709
Now!

13:12.793 --> 13:13.793
Mmm.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.632
One...

13:18.805 --> 13:19.640
two...

13:19.723 --> 13:21.017
I'm not afraid of you.

13:24.983 --> 13:25.860
Three.

13:25.902 --> 13:29.075
OK, I am going, I am going.
I hate you.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.166
Um, Yuki is teaching me to cook.

13:33.375 --> 13:34.375
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

13:34.460 --> 13:35.547
But, um...

13:36.422 --> 13:39.596
- like with Maya I might be bothering her.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

13:39.805 --> 13:41.474
<i>Can you hold on?
Curtis?</i>

13:41.559 --> 13:43.980
<i>Anna, I can't do
two things at once, OK?</i>

13:44.188 --> 13:45.482
<i>I-I'm gonna call you back, OK?</i>

13:45.567 --> 13:47.152
Mm-hmm. Bye.

14:00.722 --> 14:01.722
What?

14:06.316 --> 14:07.443
You OK?

14:08.529 --> 14:11.075
I feel like my parents
are being annoying, so...

14:18.841 --> 14:20.511
I could tell they were bothering you.

14:24.143 --> 14:25.730
You wanna talk about it?

14:26.105 --> 14:30.030
No, I kinda wanna go to bed.

14:38.547 --> 14:39.547
Mmm.

14:40.133 --> 14:42.514
Do you mind if I sleep alone
on the bed tonight

14:42.597 --> 14:44.768
'cause I just haven't
been sleeping that well?

14:46.981 --> 14:47.981
Sure.

14:53.118 --> 14:54.179
Can I at least have a pillow?

14:54.203 --> 14:55.497
Yeah, of course.

14:56.249 --> 14:58.211
Can I?
I can't really get it. OK.

14:58.294 --> 14:59.296
Thanks.

15:03.973 --> 15:05.643
- I was fluffing it.
- Yeah.

15:05.893 --> 15:08.273
I fluffed it a lot
before you got here so...

15:09.943 --> 15:11.487
it should be fluffy enough.

15:38.793 --> 15:40.713
- Good morning.
- Morning, Anna.

15:40.963 --> 15:42.466
How did you sleep last night?

15:43.343 --> 15:45.097
My back hurts a little, but I am fine.

15:45.180 --> 15:46.265
OK.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.521
I need my eraser.

16:09.938 --> 16:11.357
Hey, that's mine.

16:11.482 --> 16:12.482
No, it's not.

16:13.027 --> 16:14.155
- This?
- Yeah.

16:14.238 --> 16:15.238
No.

16:15.448 --> 16:16.488
- No, I...
- I bought this.

16:16.535 --> 16:17.888
You don't have any cool erasers,
this is mine.

16:17.912 --> 16:19.552
Are you kidding? I bought that at Sanrio.

16:19.624 --> 16:20.769
Yeah, I am kidding, ha ha ha.

16:20.793 --> 16:22.193
- No, I am serious.
- You... Anna...

16:22.254 --> 16:23.774
I-I bought it and I let you borrow it.

16:26.930 --> 16:29.310
Silent work time.

16:30.980 --> 16:32.065
Can you give it back?

16:32.149 --> 16:33.611
Seriously ask someone else for one.

16:33.736 --> 16:35.573
Ask your mom for one to buy one for you.

16:35.656 --> 16:37.093
- Anna, give it to me. It's mine.
- Sto...

16:37.117 --> 16:39.581
- I am... I am...
- Stop. I need to use it.

16:39.664 --> 16:40.944
I am literally erasing one word.

16:42.002 --> 16:45.258
Go ask someone else for one,
like literally I need it right now.

16:45.342 --> 16:46.342
This minute?

16:46.595 --> 16:48.849
- You're so annoying.
- You're being a bitch.

16:48.933 --> 16:49.809
What?

16:49.893 --> 16:51.354
That's enough!

16:51.437 --> 16:53.483
Clearly, I need to separate you two.

16:53.567 --> 16:55.571
Anna Kone, sit right here.

17:28.721 --> 17:30.056
Oh, my God.

17:30.181 --> 17:34.189
This is why you kids are not allowed
to play with anything on my desk.

17:36.027 --> 17:37.404
I am like bleeding.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.045
<i>What's wrong? How is it?</i>

17:45.128 --> 17:46.213
Mm-hmm, it's really fun.

17:46.339 --> 17:48.176
<i>Good.
Aren't you gonna ask me how am I doing?</i>

17:48.343 --> 17:49.470
<i>Ask me, about me.</i>

17:49.554 --> 17:50.554
I know.

17:50.806 --> 17:52.518
I was about to ask. How are you?

17:52.685 --> 17:54.522
- <i>I am talking our daughter, okay.</i>
- Mom.

17:54.606 --> 17:55.709
<i>Curt, is that OK?
You're so controlling...</i>

17:55.733 --> 17:57.779
Can you pay attention,
I'm trying to talk to you.

17:57.862 --> 18:00.033
- <i>I am paying attention, but please...</i>
- What?

18:00.492 --> 18:02.789
- I am seriously not. I'm just...
- <i>All right.</i>

18:02.914 --> 18:05.126
- <i>Curtis... OK, look, you know what...</i>
- Who do you...

18:05.210 --> 18:07.799
<i>I can't... I can't talk
to both of you at the same time.</i>

18:07.882 --> 18:09.820
<i>I am getting so distracted.
You know there's too much...</i>

18:09.844 --> 18:12.224
<i>Can you just be ready
to go on when we get there?</i>

18:12.307 --> 18:14.507
<i>- OK. I love you so much, Anna.</i>
- OK, I'll see you soon.

18:14.562 --> 18:16.566
- <i>Curtis, why...</i>
- Thanks for listening. Bye.

18:16.692 --> 18:17.819
<i>I mean...</i>

18:22.035 --> 18:23.035
Thanks.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.756
I didn't get the memo
about the hair brushing.

19:31.716 --> 19:34.556
Oh, I'll brush yours the next. OK?

19:35.014 --> 19:36.014
Fine.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.524
Can I at least have an Oreo?

19:40.609 --> 19:42.655
Oh, sorry, that was the last one.

19:44.241 --> 19:45.493
Oh, sorry.

19:48.542 --> 19:49.836
What's going on here?

19:51.673 --> 19:52.508
This...

19:52.592 --> 19:54.052
This is getting, like, really weird.

19:54.136 --> 19:56.366
Like, you have your own family.
Can you go back to your own family?

19:56.390 --> 19:57.518
Don't be so rude, Maya.

19:57.602 --> 19:59.438
No. I am sick of her being here
at my house.

19:59.522 --> 20:01.526
Like, you are stretching out
my PJ's, Anna.

20:01.610 --> 20:03.947
Maya, stop acting like a baby.

20:04.489 --> 20:06.118
You are not a little girl anymore.

20:09.626 --> 20:10.626
What?

20:13.007 --> 20:15.219
Oh, my God, I guess that's my parents.

20:15.303 --> 20:18.142
OK. I'm sorry, Anna.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.518
No, I get it.

20:20.271 --> 20:21.816
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:21.942 --> 20:22.942
Bye.

20:31.418 --> 20:33.339
Thanks... for having me.

20:33.422 --> 20:34.422
It's all right.

20:49.580 --> 20:50.624
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:53.421 --> 20:54.421
How was it?

20:54.966 --> 20:56.803
Good. Good.

20:57.262 --> 20:58.262
How was it with Maya?

20:58.598 --> 20:59.598
Good.

21:00.184 --> 21:01.563
- Good.
- OK.

21:17.052 --> 21:18.722
Oh, no.

21:19.974 --> 21:20.976
No...

21:21.936 --> 21:22.980
No...

21:44.649 --> 21:46.611
Maya, come here.

21:54.167 --> 21:56.380
You can never talk to someone like that,

21:56.756 --> 21:58.259
especially to your friend.

22:01.265 --> 22:02.560
Yeah, but she was...

22:02.643 --> 22:03.643
No.

22:07.068 --> 22:09.615
Anna is going
through a tough time right now,

22:10.158 --> 22:12.162
so we gotta be there for her.

22:12.245 --> 22:14.207
Mom, I am going
through a tough time right now

22:14.291 --> 22:15.794
and you haven't been there for me.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.965
But I am always here for you.

22:18.382 --> 22:19.382
Always.

22:19.802 --> 22:21.556
When you said that I am not...

22:22.348 --> 22:23.977
your little girl anymore,

22:25.229 --> 22:26.481
did you mean that?

22:28.904 --> 22:30.489
You're always my little girl.

22:34.665 --> 22:36.043
- Mmm.
- Oh...

23:21.133 --> 23:22.636
- Anna.
- Yeah.

23:23.555 --> 23:25.517
Can we come in for a minute?

23:26.310 --> 23:27.310
Yeah.

23:33.490 --> 23:34.660
Um...

23:37.541 --> 23:38.541
What's up?

23:47.310 --> 23:48.310
Go ahead.

23:50.901 --> 23:53.405
Your dad and I
have something to tell you.

23:57.497 --> 23:58.958
I don't know how to say this.

24:07.016 --> 24:10.982
Things with me and your dad
haven't been working...

24:12.276 --> 24:13.278
for a long time.

24:16.159 --> 24:17.159
Right, Curtis?

24:19.917 --> 24:20.917
That's right.

24:25.052 --> 24:26.931
So, I hate...

24:28.308 --> 24:29.728
to tell you this...

24:35.448 --> 24:36.448
But we're...

24:37.076 --> 24:38.747
getting a divorce.

24:40.959 --> 24:41.959
OK.

24:43.338 --> 24:44.592
The retreat...

24:45.927 --> 24:47.514
helped us realize

24:48.933 --> 24:50.144
that it's, uh...

24:51.939 --> 24:53.526
the right thing to do.

25:36.486 --> 25:38.616
<i>You have reached the Ishii-Peters.</i>

25:38.950 --> 25:41.329
<i>Please leave your name and phone number</i>
