It's sage. It's supposed to help

25
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:04,753
I want the house to be really clean

- No, no, no. Don't. No.

28

Why in the hell
are we taking rocks to the retreat?

29
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:14,856
- They are crystals, all right?
- Yeah, bu...

30
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,150
And we need them for the meditations.

- Says who?
- What is this retreat for?

32
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:21,118
Well, it's because your dad and I
haven't been getting along.

33
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:22,705
Well, you probably weren't aware of that.

34

Yeah, she... she knows, Kathy,

35
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,799

00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:55,244
and I poop a lot out of it.

176
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:57,290
OK.

177
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:58,835
You guys just don't realize it.

178
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,006
I am the smelliest shit there ever was.

179
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,425
Can I wear your chain?

180
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,343
Leave.

181
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:08,813
Hello.

182
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:12,361
My name is Mayana.

183
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:15,034
Hello, Mother. Hello, brother.

184
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,459
- Morning.
- Did you see that?

185
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:21,714
- Morning.
- That's 'cause we are twins.

186
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,177
This looks amazing.

187
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:37,078
Oh, my God.

188
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,794
- You like it?
- Really... Wow.

189
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,548
- I love it.
- Oh.

190
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,554
What?

191
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,560
I barely had a bite. I am not done.

192
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,772
- Anna, just a little bit.
- I wasn't done.

193
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:52,776
- I, like, didn't even have any.
- OK.

194
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,907
- Seriously?
- Yes.

195
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:56,993
Mmm.

196
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:58,913
Thanks a lot.

197
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:00,457
- It's OK, sis, we'll share.
- Enjoy.

198
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:01,418
Thank you.

199
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,760
Do you want some? Oop, sorry.

200
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:08,432
Aah, that's my napkin.

201
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:10,477
Yeah, Anna, stop being a dummy.

202
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:14,152
You are so funny, Shuji.

203
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,697
But for a dumb person.

204
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:19,788
Hello.

205
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:23,170
I am your substitute teacher,
Ms. Osei-Kuffor.

206
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:27,804
Now, Mr. O told me to teach y'all
some history on Mark Twain.

207
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:30,602
But guess what rhymes with Twain?

208
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:33,524
Harriet Tubmain.

209
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:35,946
We're gonna be learning about her,

210
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,408
and all the rest of my heroes today.

211
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:39,912
- Now, I want everyone to write an essay...
- Maya...

212
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:44,672
Um, are we still on to practice
our dance after school

213
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:45,840
- or...
- Yeah.

214
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,553
Fifty pages.

215
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,807
- OK.
- Of course.

216
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:52,311
- OK.
- That's the plan.

217
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:53,480
OK.

218
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,823
<i>All right.
Five, six, seven, eight...</i>

219
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:06,464
OK, sorry, you keep doing that.
It's actually like this.

220
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,597
That's exactly what I did.

221
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,435
OK, no. You were doing...

222
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,316
It's like this,
and you were doing like... this.

223
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,069
And it's like this.

224
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:19,742
I wasn't. I was doing this,

225
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,038
But OK, whatever.

226
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:24,292
Actually, I don't really
want to do it anymore.

227
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,503
Let's just not practice.

228
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:27,214
I am gonna talk to my boyfriend.

229
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,843
Can I have some privacy.

230
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:31,849
- Please.
- Who's that?

231
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:34,103
What?

232
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:36,609
Who is your boyfriend?

233
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:39,907
It's Flymiamibro.

234
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:43,455
Like, I have talked about him

235
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,457
- constantly.
- No, I know.

236
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,587
I didn't know it was official.
It's official now?

237
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,177
Haven't been able to talk to him
since however many days you have been here

238
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,473
- 'cause there hasn't been time, but...
- All right, fine, whatever.

239
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:53,685
OK. Whatever!

240
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:59,153
To be honest,
my mom usually uses canned tomatoes

241
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:00,949
- so I have not really done this.
- Oh.

242
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:02,828
Like this?

243
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,540
- Or like...
- Like that.

244
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:05,875
Yeah, yeah...

245
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:08,130
Very good, Anna. You're natural.

246
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:10,635
- Is that thin enough?
- Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,304
- Thanks.
- Good.

248
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:15,102
What are you guys doing?

249
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,314
- Slice them a little bit thinner.
- Yeah.

250
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:18,233
I can help.

251
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,112
- Here, I'll... give me one.
- Be careful.

252
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:21,907
Shh... Ouch. Ow.

253
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:25,372
That's actually different
than your mom wants it to be cut.

254
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:28,378
I know how my mom
wants her tomatoes cut, Anna.

255
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,134
- Th-that's...
- That works.

256
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,474
N... Not really. It looks... ugh.

257
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:38,023
- If you can't use that then you can't use...
- Maya.

258
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:40,402
...anything. I don't really understand.

259
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,158
- Shh...
- Sorry, she's so silly.

260
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:44,787
She's...

261
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:46,498
OK.

262
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,878
What do I do with the end slice?

263
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:50,005
Oh, eat it.

264
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:51,634
Eat it.

265
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:52,677
It's OK.

266
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:55,390
- Mmm.
- Yum?

267
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:56,602
Mm-hmm.

268
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:58,898
...she kinda puts it to her nose...

269
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:00,819
...and smells it and goes,

270
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:03,950
"A female raccoon
has been living in my helmet."

271
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:06,872
So...

272
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:08,041
It's like...

273
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,295
What are you talking about?

274
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,924
I was like, "What?"

275
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:14,513
She'd know that.

276
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,857
It's not that funny, you guys.

277
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,819
It's hilarious, no, come on.

278
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:23,614
So... does your dad sing?

279
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,244
He does. He's a very good singer.

280
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:29,208
And my mom can't hold a...
can't hold a note,

281
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,419
very tone deaf.

282
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,383
- Well, you are really a great singer.
- Hmm.

283
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:34,595
Thank you.

284
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,389
I sing too, Dad.

285
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:37,934
Yeah, I know... I know, honey.

286
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,982
But, um, you are interested
in scatting too, right?

287
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:42,569
I like it, but...

288
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:43,779
I don't wanna know if I am

289
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,975
♪ <i>I am flying now...</i> ♪

290
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,691
♪ <i>I have a little cape
'Cause I fly real high</i> ♪

291
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:27,867
I think you are just hurting our ears.

292
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,122
Um, can I just use your phone?

293
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:32,334
'Cause I just remembered I need to call
my parents to check in.

294
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,005
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, we are not allowed to use the phone

295
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,298
during dinner.

296
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:36,259
- Oh, OK. Sorry.
- Yeah.

297
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:38,639
No, it's OK. Anna is a guest so it's OK.

298
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:40,977
- So go ahead, call your parents.
- It's fine.

299
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:42,731
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

300
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:48,199
Never in the 13 years
that I have been living

301
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:50,078
have you ever let me
use the phone during dinner.

302
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,374
She's a guest, it's OK.

303
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:54,588
Bullshit.

304
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:55,548
What?

305
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:57,510
What did you say?

306
00:12:58,053 --> 00:12:58,888
Nothing.

307
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:02,771
I just... what I said is "bullshay."

308
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:05,233
No, you didn't.

309
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:06,570
Yes, I did.

310
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:08,406
Fuck you.

311
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:10,912
Maya, go to your room.

312
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,707
- No.
- Go to your room.

313
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,709
Now!

314
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,711
Mmm.

315
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,632
One...

316
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:20,640
two...

317
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:22,017
I'm not afraid of you.

318
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:26,860
...three.

319
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:30,075
OK, I am going, I am going.
I hate you.

320
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,166
Um, Yuki is teaching me to cook.

321
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,335
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

322
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,547
But, um...

323
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:40,596
- like with Maya I might be bothering her.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

324
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,474
<i>Can you hold on?
Curtis?</i>

325
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,980
<i>Anna, I can't do
two things at once, OK?</i>

326
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:46,482
<i>I-I'm gonna call you back, OK?</i>

327
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,152
Mm-hmm. Bye.

328
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:02,682
What?

329
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:08,443
You OK?

330
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,075
I feel like my parents
are being annoying, so...

331
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:21,511
I could tell they were bothering you.

332
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:26,730
You wanna talk about it?

333
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:31,030
No, I kinda wanna go to bed.

334
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:40,423
Mmm.

335
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,514
Do you mind if I sleep alone
on the bed tonight

336
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:45,768
'cause I just haven't
been sleeping that well?

337
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:48,857
Sure.

338
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:55,120
Can I at least have a pillow?

339
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,497
Yeah, of course.

340
00:14:57,249 --> 00:14:59,211
Can I?
I can't really get it. OK.

341
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:00,296
Thanks.

342
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:06,643
- I was fluffing it.
- Yeah.

343
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:09,273
I fluffed it a lot
before you got here so...

344
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,487
it should be fluffy enough.

345
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,713
- Good morning.
- Morning, Anna.

346
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,466
How did you sleep last night?

347
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,097
My back hurts a little, but I am fine.

348
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,265
OK.

349
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:10,599
I need my eraser.

350
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,357
Hey, that's mine.

351
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:13,359
No, it's not.

352
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:15,155
- This?
- Yeah.

353
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:16,073
No.

354
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:17,409
- No, I...
- I bought this.

355
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:18,787
You don't have any cool erasers,
this is mine.

356
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,498
Are you kidding? I bought that at Sanrio.

357
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:21,710
Yeah, I am kidding, ha ha ha.

358
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:23,171
- No, I am serious.
- You... Anna...

359
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:24,757
I-I bought it and I let you borrow it.

360
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,310
Silent work time.

361
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,065
Can you give it back?

362
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,611
Seriously ask someone else for one.

363
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:36,573
Ask your mom for one to buy one for you.

364
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:38,034
- Anna, give it to me. It's mine.
- Sto...

365
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:40,581
- I am... I am...
- Stop. I need to use it.

366
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:41,791
I am literally erasing one word.

367
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,258
Go ask someone else for one,
like literally I need it right now.

368
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:47,219
This minute?

369
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:49,849
- You're so annoying.
- You're being a bitch.

370
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:50,809
What?

371
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,354
That's enough!

372
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:54,483
Clearly, I need to separate you two.

373
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,571
Anna Kone, sit right here.

374
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:31,056
Oh, my God.

375
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:35,189
This is why you kids are not allowed
to play with anything on my desk.

376
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:38,404
I am like bleeding.

377
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,045
<i>What's wrong? How is it?</i>

378
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:47,213
Mm-hmm, it's really fun.

379
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:49,176
<i>Good.
Aren't you gonna ask me how am I doing?</i>

380
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:50,470
<i>Ask me, about me.</i>

381
00:17:50,554 --> 00:17:51,430
I know.

382
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,518
I was about to ask. How are you?

383
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,522
- <i>I am talking our daughter, okay.</i>
- Mom.

384
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:56,650
<i>Curt, is that OK?
You're so controlling...</i>

385
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,779
Can you pay attention,
I'm trying to talk to you.

386
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:01,033
- <i>I am paying attention, but please...</i>
- What?

387
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:03,789
- I am seriously not. I'm just...
- <i>All right.</i>

388
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:06,126
- <i>Curtis... OK, look, you know what...</i>
- Who do you...

389
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,799
<i>I can't... I can't talk
to both of you at the same time.</i>

390
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:10,761
<i>I am getting so distracted.
You know there's too much...</i>

391
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:13,224
<i>Can you just be ready
to go on when we get there?</i>

392
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:15,478
<i>- OK. I love you so much, Anna.</i>
- OK, I'll see you soon.

393
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,566
- <i>Curtis, why...</i>
- Thanks for listening. Bye.

394
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:18,819
<i>I mean...</i>

395
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:23,912
Thanks.

396
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,756
I didn't get the memo
about the hair brushing.

397
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:35,556
Oh, I'll brush yours the next. OK?

398
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:36,891
Fine.

399
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,524
Can I at least have an Oreo?

400
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:43,655
Oh, sorry, that was the last one.

401
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:46,493
Oh, sorry.

402
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,836
What's going on here?

403
00:19:52,673 --> 00:19:53,508
This...

404
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,052
This is getting, like, really weird.

405
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:57,307
Like, you have your own family.
Can you go back to your own family?

406
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,518
Don't be so rude, Maya.

407
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,438
No. I am sick of her being here
at my house.

408
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:02,526
Like, you are stretching out
my PJ's, Anna.

409
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,947
Maya, stop acting like a baby.

410
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:07,118
You are not a little girl anymore.

411
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,502
What?

412
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,219
Oh, my God, I guess that's my parents.

413
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:19,142
OK. I'm sorry, Anna.

414
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,436
No, I get it.

415
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:22,816
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

416
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:23,818
Bye.

417
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:34,339
Thanks... for having me.

418
00:20:34,422 --> 00:20:35,299
It's all right.

419
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,624
- Hi.
- Hey.

420
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,297
How was it?

421
00:20:55,966 --> 00:20:57,803
Good. Good.

422
00:20:58,262 --> 00:20:59,180
How was it with Maya?

423
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:00,474
Good.

424
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:02,563
- Good.
- OK.

425
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:19,722
Oh, no.

426
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:21,976
No...

427
00:21:22,936 --> 00:21:23,980
No...

428
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:47,611
Maya, come here.

429
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,380
You can never talk to someone like that,

430
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:59,259
especially to your friend.

431
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:03,560
Yeah, but she was...

432
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:04,520
No.

433
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:10,615
Anna is going
through a tough time right now,

434
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:13,162
so we gotta be there for her.

435
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:15,207
Mom, I am going
through a tough time right now

436
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,794
and you haven't been there for me.

437
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,965
But I am always here for you.

438
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:20,217
Always.

439
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:22,556
When you said that I am not...

440
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:24,977
your little girl anymore,

441
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:27,481
did you mean that?

442
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:31,489
You're always my little girl.

443
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:37,043
- Mmm.
- Oh...

444
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,636
- Anna.
- Yeah.

445
00:23:24,555 --> 00:23:26,517
Can we come in for a minute?

446
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,186
Yeah.

447
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,660
Um...

448
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,375
What's up?

449
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,187
Go ahead.

450
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:54,405
Your dad and I
have something to tell you.

451
00:23:58,497 --> 00:23:59,958
I don't know how to say this.

452
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:11,982
Things with me and your dad
haven't been working...

453
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:14,278
for a long time.

454
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,036
Right, Curtis?

455
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,794
That's right.

456
00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:27,931
So, I hate...

457
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:30,728
to tell you this...

458
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:37,324
But we're...

459
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,747
getting a divorce.

460
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,836
OK.

461
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:45,592
The retreat...

462
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:48,514
helped us realize

463
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:51,144
that it's, uh...

464
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:54,526
the right thing to do.

465
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:39,616
