- What is this retreat for?

Well, it's because your dad and I
haven't been getting along.

09:40.992 --> 09:43.455
Like, I have talked about him

09:43.539 --> 09:44.457
- constantly.
- No, I know.

09:44.541 --> 09:46.587
I didn't know it was official.
It's official now?

09:47.421 --> 09:50.177
Haven't been able to talk to him
since however many days you have been here

09:50.260 --> 09:52.473
- 'cause there hasn't been time, but...
- All right, fine, whatever.

09:52.808 --> 09:53.685
OK. Whatever!

09:56.481 --> 09:59.153
To be honest,
my mom usually uses canned tomatoes

09:59.237 --> 10:00.949
- so I have not really done this.
- Oh.

10:01.449 --> 10:02.828
Like this?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.540
- Or like...
- Like that.

10:04.623 --> 10:05.875
Yeah, yeah...

10:05.959 --> 10:08.130
Very good, Anna. You're natural.

10:08.296 --> 10:10.635
- Is that thin enough?
- Yes, yes, yes.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.304
- Thanks.
- Good.

10:13.975 --> 10:15.102
What are you guys doing?

10:15.770 --> 10:17.314
- Slice them a little bit thinner.
- Yeah.

10:17.398 --> 10:18.233
I can help.

10:18.275 --> 10:20.112
- Here, I'll... give me one.
- Be careful.

10:20.404 --> 10:21.907
Shh... Ouch. Ow.

10:22.826 --> 10:25.372
That's actually different
than your mom wants it to be cut.

10:25.414 --> 10:28.378
I know how my mom
wants her tomatoes cut, Anna.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.134
- Th-that's...
- That works.

10:31.259 --> 10:34.474
N... Not really. It looks... ugh.

10:35.727 --> 10:38.023
- If you can't use that then you can't use...
- Maya.

10:38.106 --> 10:40.402
...anything. I don't really understand.

10:40.904 --> 10:43.158
- Shh...
- Sorry, she's so silly.

10:43.868 --> 10:44.787
She's...

10:45.622 --> 10:46.498
OK.

10:46.957 --> 10:48.878
What do I do with the end slice?

10:49.086 --> 10:50.005
Oh, eat it.

10:50.757 --> 10:51.634
Eat it.

10:51.801 --> 10:52.677
It's OK.

10:53.805 --> 10:55.390
- Mmm.
- Yum?

10:55.474 --> 10:56.602
Mm-hmm.

10:57.186 --> 10:58.898
...she kinda puts it to her nose...

10:59.106 --> 11:00.819
...and smells it and goes,

11:00.985 --> 11:03.950
"A female raccoon
has been living in my helmet."

11:05.995 --> 11:06.872
So...

11:07.122 --> 11:08.041
It's like...

11:08.166 --> 11:10.295
What are you talking about?

11:10.630 --> 11:11.924
I was like, "What?"

11:13.385 --> 11:14.513
She'd know that.

11:17.393 --> 11:19.857
It's not that funny, you guys.

11:19.982 --> 11:21.819
It's hilarious, no, come on.

11:22.152 --> 11:23.614
So... does your dad sing?

11:24.490 --> 11:26.244
He does. He's a very good singer.

11:26.327 --> 11:29.208
And my mom can't hold a...
can't hold a note,

11:29.292 --> 11:30.419
very tone deaf.

11:30.460 --> 11:33.383
- Well, you are really a great singer.
- Hmm.

11:33.466 --> 11:34.595
Thank you.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.389
I sing too, Dad.

11:36.932 --> 11:37.934
Yeah, I know... I know, honey.

11:38.018 --> 11:40.982
But, um, you are interested
in scatting too, right?

11:41.065 --> 11:42.569
I like it, but...

11:42.652 --> 11:43.779
I don't wanna know if I am

12:17.388 --> 12:18.975
♪ <i>I am flying now...</i> ♪

12:19.100 --> 12:22.691
♪ <i>I have a little cape
'Cause I fly real high</i> ♪

12:26.155 --> 12:27.867
I think you are just hurting our ears.

12:28.493 --> 12:30.122
Um, can I just use your phone?

12:30.163 --> 12:32.334
'Cause I just remembered I need to call
my parents to check in.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.005
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, we are not allowed to use the phone

12:34.088 --> 12:35.298
during dinner.

12:35.382 --> 12:36.259
- Oh, OK. Sorry.
- Yeah.

12:36.342 --> 12:38.639
No, it's OK. Anna is a guest so it's OK.

12:38.723 --> 12:40.977
- So go ahead, call your parents.
- It's fine.

12:41.436 --> 12:42.731
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

12:45.737 --> 12:48.199
Never in the 13 years
that I have been living

12:48.283 --> 12:50.078
have you ever let me
use the phone during dinner.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.374
She's a guest, it's OK.

12:53.502 --> 12:54.588
Bullshit.

12:54.671 --> 12:55.548
What?

12:56.132 --> 12:57.510
What did you say?

12:58.053 --> 12:58.888
Nothing.

12:59.848 --> 13:02.771
I just... what I said is "bullshay."

13:04.315 --> 13:05.233
No, you didn't.

13:05.275 --> 13:06.570
Yes, I did.

13:07.488 --> 13:08.406
Fuck you.

13:09.743 --> 13:10.912
Maya, go to your room.

13:11.037 --> 13:12.707
- No.
- Go to your room.

13:12.791 --> 13:13.709
Now!

13:13.793 --> 13:14.711
Mmm.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.632
One...

13:19.805 --> 13:20.640
two...

13:20.723 --> 13:22.017
I'm not afraid of you.

13:25.983 --> 13:26.860
...three.

13:26.902 --> 13:30.075
OK, I am going, I am going.
I hate you.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.166
Um, Yuki is teaching me to cook.

13:34.375 --> 13:35.335
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

13:35.460 --> 13:36.547
But, um...

13:37.422 --> 13:40.596
- like with Maya I might be bothering her.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

13:40.805 --> 13:42.474
<i>Can you hold on?
Curtis?</i>

13:42.559 --> 13:44.980
<i>Anna, I can't do
two things at once, OK?</i>

13:45.188 --> 13:46.482
<i>I-I'm gonna call you back, OK?</i>

13:46.567 --> 13:48.152
Mm-hmm. Bye.

14:01.722 --> 14:02.682
What?

14:07.316 --> 14:08.443
You OK?

14:09.529 --> 14:12.075
I feel like my parents
are being annoying, so...

14:19.841 --> 14:21.511
I could tell they were bothering you.

14:25.143 --> 14:26.730
You wanna talk about it?

14:27.105 --> 14:31.030
No, I kinda wanna go to bed.

14:39.547 --> 14:40.423
Mmm.

14:41.133 --> 14:43.514
Do you mind if I sleep alone
on the bed tonight

14:43.597 --> 14:45.768
'cause I just haven't
been sleeping that well?

14:47.981 --> 14:48.857
Sure.

14:54.118 --> 14:55.120
Can I at least have a pillow?

14:55.203 --> 14:56.497
Yeah, of course.

14:57.249 --> 14:59.211
Can I?
I can't really get it. OK.

14:59.294 --> 15:00.296
Thanks.

15:04.973 --> 15:06.643
- I was fluffing it.
- Yeah.

15:06.893 --> 15:09.273
I fluffed it a lot
before you got here so...

15:10.943 --> 15:12.487
it should be fluffy enough.

15:39.793 --> 15:41.713
- Good morning.
- Morning, Anna.

15:41.963 --> 15:43.466
How did you sleep last night?

15:44.343 --> 15:46.097
My back hurts a little, but I am fine.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.265
OK.

16:09.346 --> 16:10.599
I need my eraser.

16:10.938 --> 16:12.357
Hey, that's mine.

16:12.482 --> 16:13.359
No, it's not.

16:14.027 --> 16:15.155
- This?
- Yeah.

16:15.238 --> 16:16.073
No.

16:16.448 --> 16:17.409
- No, I...
- I bought this.

16:17.535 --> 16:18.787
You don't have any cool erasers,
this is mine.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.498
Are you kidding? I bought that at Sanrio.

16:20.624 --> 16:21.710
Yeah, I am kidding, ha ha ha.

16:21.793 --> 16:23.171
- No, I am serious.
- You... Anna...

16:23.254 --> 16:24.757
I-I bought it and I let you borrow it.

16:27.930 --> 16:30.310
Silent work time.

16:31.980 --> 16:33.065
Can you give it back?

16:33.149 --> 16:34.611
Seriously ask someone else for one.

16:34.736 --> 16:36.573
Ask your mom for one to buy one for you.

16:36.656 --> 16:38.034
- Anna, give it to me. It's mine.
- Sto...

16:38.117 --> 16:40.581
- I am... I am...
- Stop. I need to use it.

16:40.664 --> 16:41.791
I am literally erasing one word.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.258
Go ask someone else for one,
like literally I need it right now.

16:46.342 --> 16:47.219
This minute?

16:47.595 --> 16:49.849
- You're so annoying.
- You're being a bitch.

16:49.933 --> 16:50.809
What?

16:50.893 --> 16:52.354
That's enough!

16:52.437 --> 16:54.483
Clearly, I need to separate you two.

16:54.567 --> 16:56.571
Anna Kone, sit right here.

17:29.721 --> 17:31.056
Oh, my God.

17:31.181 --> 17:35.189
This is why you kids are not allowed
to play with anything on my desk.

17:37.027 --> 17:38.404
I am like bleeding.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.045
<i>What's wrong? How is it?</i>

17:46.128 --> 17:47.213
Mm-hmm, it's really fun.

17:47.339 --> 17:49.176
<i>Good.
Aren't you gonna ask me how am I doing?</i>

17:49.343 --> 17:50.470
<i>Ask me, about me.</i>

17:50.554 --> 17:51.430
I know.

17:51.806 --> 17:53.518
I was about to ask. How are you?

17:53.685 --> 17:55.522
- <i>I am talking our daughter, okay.</i>
- Mom.

17:55.606 --> 17:56.650
<i>Curt, is that OK?
You're so controlling...</i>

17:56.733 --> 17:58.779
Can you pay attention,
I'm trying to talk to you.

17:58.862 --> 18:01.033
- <i>I am paying attention, but please...</i>
- What?

18:01.492 --> 18:03.789
- I am seriously not. I'm just...
- <i>All right.</i>

18:03.914 --> 18:06.126
- <i>Curtis... OK, look, you know what...</i>
- Who do you...

18:06.210 --> 18:08.799
<i>I can't... I can't talk
to both of you at the same time.</i>

18:08.882 --> 18:10.761
<i>I am getting so distracted.
You know there's too much...</i>

18:10.844 --> 18:13.224
<i>Can you just be ready
to go on when we get there?</i>

18:13.307 --> 18:15.478
<i>- OK. I love you so much, Anna.</i>
- OK, I'll see you soon.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.566
- <i>Curtis, why...</i>
- Thanks for listening. Bye.

18:17.692 --> 18:18.819
<i>I mean...</i>

18:23.035 --> 18:23.912
Thanks.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.756
I didn't get the memo
about the hair brushing.

19:32.716 --> 19:35.556
Oh, I'll brush yours the next. OK?

19:36.014 --> 19:36.891
Fine.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.524
Can I at least have an Oreo?

19:41.609 --> 19:43.655
Oh, sorry, that was the last one.

19:45.241 --> 19:46.493
Oh, sorry.

19:49.542 --> 19:50.836
What's going on here?

19:52.673 --> 19:53.508
This...

19:53.592 --> 19:55.052
This is getting, like, really weird.

19:55.136 --> 19:57.307
Like, you have your own family.
Can you go back to your own family?

19:57.390 --> 19:58.518
Don't be so rude, Maya.

19:58.602 --> 20:00.438
No. I am sick of her being here
at my house.

20:00.522 --> 20:02.526
Like, you are stretching out
my PJ's, Anna.

20:02.610 --> 20:04.947
Maya, stop acting like a baby.

20:05.489 --> 20:07.118
You are not a little girl anymore.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.502
What?

20:14.007 --> 20:16.219
Oh, my God, I guess that's my parents.

20:16.303 --> 20:19.142
OK. I'm sorry, Anna.

20:19.518 --> 20:20.436
No, I get it.

20:21.271 --> 20:22.816
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:22.942 --> 20:23.818
Bye.

20:32.418 --> 20:34.339
Thanks... for having me.

20:34.422 --> 20:35.299
It's all right.

20:50.580 --> 20:51.624
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.297
How was it?

20:55.966 --> 20:57.803
Good. Good.

20:58.262 --> 20:59.180
How was it with Maya?

20:59.598 --> 21:00.474
Good.

21:01.184 --> 21:02.563
- Good.
- OK.

21:18.052 --> 21:19.722
Oh, no.

21:20.974 --> 21:21.976
No...

21:22.936 --> 21:23.980
No...

21:45.649 --> 21:47.611
Maya, come here.

21:55.167 --> 21:57.380
You can never talk to someone like that,

21:57.756 --> 21:59.259
especially to your friend.

22:02.265 --> 22:03.560
Yeah, but she was...

22:03.643 --> 22:04.520
No.

22:08.068 --> 22:10.615
Anna is going
through a tough time right now,

22:11.158 --> 22:13.162
so we gotta be there for her.

22:13.245 --> 22:15.207
Mom, I am going
through a tough time right now

22:15.291 --> 22:16.794
and you haven't been there for me.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.965
But I am always here for you.

22:19.382 --> 22:20.217
Always.

22:20.802 --> 22:22.556
When you said that I am not...

22:23.348 --> 22:24.977
your little girl anymore,

22:26.229 --> 22:27.481
did you mean that?

22:29.904 --> 22:31.489
You're always my little girl.

22:35.665 --> 22:37.043
- Mmm.
- Oh...

23:22.133 --> 23:23.636
- Anna.
- Yeah.

23:24.555 --> 23:26.517
Can we come in for a minute?

23:27.310 --> 23:28.186
Yeah.

23:34.490 --> 23:35.660
Um...

23:38.541 --> 23:39.375
What's up?

23:48.310 --> 23:49.187
Go ahead.

23:51.901 --> 23:54.405
Your dad and I
have something to tell you.

23:58.497 --> 23:59.958
I don't know how to say this.

24:08.016 --> 24:11.982
Things with me and your dad
haven't been working...

24:13.276 --> 24:14.278
for a long time.

24:17.159 --> 24:18.036
Right, Curtis?

24:20.917 --> 24:21.794
That's right.

24:26.052 --> 24:27.931
So, I hate...

24:29.308 --> 24:30.728
to tell you this...

24:36.448 --> 24:37.324
But we're...

24:38.076 --> 24:39.747
getting a divorce.

24:41.959 --> 24:42.836
OK.

24:44.338 --> 24:45.592
The retreat...

24:46.927 --> 24:48.514
helped us realize

24:49.933 --> 24:51.144
that it's, uh...

24:52.939 --> 24:54.526
the right thing to do.
