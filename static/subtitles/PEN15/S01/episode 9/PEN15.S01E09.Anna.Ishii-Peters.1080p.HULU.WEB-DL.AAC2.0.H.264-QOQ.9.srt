- What is this retreat for?

32
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:20,178
Well, it's because your dad and I
haven't been getting along.

33

Yeah, she... she knows, Kathy,

35
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,815

00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:44,200
I don't even know
what you are talking about.

176
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:45,224
I don't poop.

177
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:46,563
Ugh.

178
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:48,859
I mean, like, you can't poop
and you can't fart,

179
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,028
like, what's on your butt?

180
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,591
- Is there no hole in your butt?
- I have a big hole in my butt

181
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,244
and I poop a lot out of it.

182
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:56,290
OK.

183
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:57,835
You guys just don't realize it.

184
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,006
I am the smelliest shit there ever was.

185
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,425
Can I wear your chain?

186
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:02,509
Leave.

187
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:07,813
Hello.

188
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,361
My name is Mayana.

189
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:14,034
Hello, Mother. Hello, brother.

190
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,459
- Morning.
- Did you see that?

191
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:20,714
- Morning.
- That's 'cause we are twins.

192
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,177
This looks amazing.

193
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:36,078
Oh, my God.

194
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,794
- You like it?
- Really... Wow.

195
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,548
- I love it.
- Oh.

196
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:44,554
What?

197
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:47,560
I barely had a bite. I am not done.

198
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,772
- Anna, just a little bit.
- I wasn't done.

199
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,776
- I, like, didn't even have any.
- OK.

200
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,907
- Seriously?
- Yes.

201
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:56,116
Mmm.

202
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:57,913
Thanks a lot.

203
00:07:57,997 --> 00:07:59,457
- It's OK, sis, we'll share.
- Enjoy.

204
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,542
Thank you.

205
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,760
Do you want some? Oop, sorry.

206
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:07,432
Aah, that's my napkin.

207
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:09,477
Yeah, Anna, stop being a dummy.

208
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,152
You are so funny, Shuji.

209
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:14,697
But for a dumb person.

210
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:18,788
Hello.

211
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:22,170
I am your substitute teacher,
Ms. Osei-Kuffor.

212
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:26,804
Now, Mr. O told me to teach y'all
some history on Mark Twain.

213
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,602
But guess what rhymes with Twain?

214
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,524
Harriet Tubmain.

215
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:34,946
We're gonna be learning about her,

216
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:37,408
and all the rest of my heroes today.

217
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,347
- Now, I want everyone to write an essay...
- Maya...

218
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:43,672
Um, are we still on to practice
our dance after school

219
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:44,840
- or...
- Yeah.

220
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:46,553
Fifty pages.

221
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,807
- OK.
- Of course.

222
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:51,311
- OK.
- That's the plan.

223
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:52,480
OK.

224
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,823
<i>All right.
Five, six, seven, eight...</i>

225
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,464
OK, sorry, you keep doing that.
It's actually like this.

226
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,597
That's exactly what I did.

227
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:11,435
OK, no. You were doing...

228
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,316
It's like this,
and you were doing like... this.

229
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,069
And it's like this.

230
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:18,742
I wasn't. I was doing this,

231
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:21,038
But OK, whatever.

232
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,292
Actually, I don't really
want to do it anymore.

233
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,503
Let's just not practice.

234
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:26,214
I am gonna talk to my boyfriend.

235
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,843
Can I have some privacy.

236
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:30,849
- Please.
- Who's that?

237
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:33,226
What?

238
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:35,609
Who is your boyfriend?

239
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:38,907
It's Flymiamibro.

240
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,455
Like, I have talked about him

241
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,457
- constantly.
- No, I know.

242
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,587
I didn't know it was official.
It's official now?

243
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:49,236
Haven't been able to talk to him
since however many days you have been here

244
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,784
- 'cause there hasn't been time, but...
- All right, fine, whatever.

245
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:52,808
OK. Whatever!

246
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:58,153
To be honest,
my mom usually uses canned tomatoes

247
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,949
- so I have not really done this.
- Oh.

248
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,828
Like this?

249
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,540
- Or like...
- Like that.

250
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:04,875
Yeah, yeah...

251
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,130
Very good, Anna. You're natural.

252
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:09,635
- Is that thin enough?
- Yes, yes, yes.

253
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,304
- Thanks.
- Good.

254
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:14,102
What are you guys doing?

255
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,374
- Slice them a little bit thinner.
- Yeah.

256
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,233
I can help.

257
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:19,112
- Here, I'll... give me one.
- Be careful.

258
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:20,907
Shh... Ouch. Ow.

259
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,372
That's actually different
than your mom wants it to be cut.

260
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:27,378
I know how my mom
wants her tomatoes cut, Anna.

261
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:30,134
- Th-that's...
- That works.

262
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:33,474
N... Not really. It looks... ugh.

263
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:37,023
- If you can't use that then you can't use...
- Maya.

264
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,402
Anything. I don't really understand.

265
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:42,158
- Shh...
- Sorry, she's so silly.

266
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:43,868
She's...

267
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:45,622
OK.

268
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:47,878
What do I do with the end slice?

269
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:49,086
Oh, eat it.

270
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:50,757
Eat it.

271
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:51,801
It's OK.

272
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,390
- Mmm.
- Yum?

273
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:55,602
Mm-hmm.

274
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:57,898
She kinda puts it to her nose...

275
00:10:58,106 --> 00:10:59,819
and smells it and goes,

276
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:02,950
"A female raccoon
has been living in my helmet."

277
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:05,995
So...

278
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:07,122
It's like...

279
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,295
What are you talking about?

280
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,924
I was like, "What?"

281
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:13,513
She'd know that.

282
00:11:16,393 --> 00:11:18,857
It's not that funny, you guys.

283
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,819
It's hilarious, no, come on.

284
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:22,614
So... does your dad sing?

285
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,244
He does. He's a very good singer.

286
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:28,208
And my mom can't hold a...
can't hold a note,

287
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:29,419
very tone deaf.

288
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,383
- Well, you are really a great singer.
- Hmm.

289
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,595
Thank you.

290
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,389
I sing too, Dad.

291
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:36,994
Yeah, I know... I know, honey.

292
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:39,982
But, um, you are interested
in scatting too, right?

293
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,569
I like it, but...

294
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:42,779
I don't wanna know if I am

295
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:17,975
♪ <i>I am flying now...</i> ♪

296
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,691
♪ <i>I have a little cape
'Cause I fly real high</i> ♪

297
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,867
I think you are just hurting our ears.

298
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:29,122
Um, can I just use your phone?

299
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:31,352
'Cause I just remembered I need to call
my parents to check in.

300
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,064
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, we are not allowed to use the phone

301
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:34,298
during dinner.

302
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:35,259
- Oh, OK. Sorry.
- Yeah.

303
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:37,639
No, it's OK. Anna is a guest so it's OK.

304
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,977
- So go ahead, call your parents.
- It's fine.

305
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:41,731
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

306
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:47,199
Never in the 13 years
that I have been living

307
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,096
have you ever let me
use the phone during dinner.

308
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,374
She's a guest, it's OK.

309
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:53,588
Bullshit.

310
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:54,671
What?

311
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:56,510
What did you say?

312
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:58,053
Nothing.

313
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:01,771
I just... what I said is "bullshay."

314
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,233
No, you didn't.

315
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:05,570
Yes, I did.

316
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:07,488
Fuck you.

317
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:09,912
Maya, go to your room.

318
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,707
- No.
- Go to your room.

319
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,709
Now!

320
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:13,793
Mmm.

321
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,632
One...

322
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:19,640
two...

323
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:21,017
I'm not afraid of you.

324
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:25,860
Three.

325
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:29,075
OK, I am going, I am going.
I hate you.

326
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,166
Um, Yuki is teaching me to cook.

327
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,375
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

328
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,547
But, um...

329
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:39,596
- like with Maya I might be bothering her.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

330
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,474
<i>Can you hold on?
Curtis?</i>

331
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,980
<i>Anna, I can't do
two things at once, OK?</i>

332
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:45,482
<i>I-I'm gonna call you back, OK?</i>

333
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:47,152
Mm-hmm. Bye.

334
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:01,722
What?

335
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:07,443
You OK?

336
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,075
I feel like my parents
are being annoying, so...

337
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,511
I could tell they were bothering you.

338
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:25,730
You wanna talk about it?

339
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:30,030
No, I kinda wanna go to bed.

340
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:39,547
Mmm.

341
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,514
Do you mind if I sleep alone
on the bed tonight

342
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:44,768
'cause I just haven't
been sleeping that well?

343
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:47,981
Sure.

344
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:54,179
Can I at least have a pillow?

345
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:55,497
Yeah, of course.

346
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:58,211
Can I?
I can't really get it. OK.

347
00:14:58,294 --> 00:14:59,296
Thanks.

348
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:05,643
- I was fluffing it.
- Yeah.

349
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:08,273
I fluffed it a lot
before you got here so...

350
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,487
it should be fluffy enough.

351
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,713
- Good morning.
- Morning, Anna.

352
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,466
How did you sleep last night?

353
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,097
My back hurts a little, but I am fine.

354
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,265
OK.

355
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,521
I need my eraser.

356
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:11,357
Hey, that's mine.

357
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:12,482
No, it's not.

358
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:14,155
- This?
- Yeah.

359
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:15,238
No.

360
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:16,488
- No, I...
- I bought this.

361
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:17,888
You don't have any cool erasers,
this is mine.

362
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,552
Are you kidding? I bought that at Sanrio.

363
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:20,769
Yeah, I am kidding, ha ha ha.

364
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,193
- No, I am serious.
- You... Anna...

365
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:23,774
I-I bought it and I let you borrow it.

366
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,310
Silent work time.

367
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,065
Can you give it back?

368
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:33,611
Seriously ask someone else for one.

369
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:35,573
Ask your mom for one to buy one for you.

370
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,093
- Anna, give it to me. It's mine.
- Sto...

371
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:39,581
- I am... I am...
- Stop. I need to use it.

372
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:40,944
I am literally erasing one word.

373
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,258
Go ask someone else for one,
like literally I need it right now.

374
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:46,342
This minute?

375
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,849
- You're so annoying.
- You're being a bitch.

376
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:49,809
What?

377
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,354
That's enough!

378
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:53,483
Clearly, I need to separate you two.

379
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,571
Anna Kone, sit right here.

380
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,056
Oh, my God.

381
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:34,189
This is why you kids are not allowed
to play with anything on my desk.

382
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:37,404
I am like bleeding.

383
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:45,045
<i>What's wrong? How is it?</i>

384
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:46,213
Mm-hmm, it's really fun.

385
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:48,176
<i>Good.
Aren't you gonna ask me how am I doing?</i>

386
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:49,470
<i>Ask me, about me.</i>

387
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:50,554
I know.

388
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:52,518
I was about to ask. How are you?

389
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,522
- <i>I am talking our daughter, okay.</i>
- Mom.

390
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,709
<i>Curt, is that OK?
You're so controlling...</i>

391
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,779
Can you pay attention,
I'm trying to talk to you.

392
00:17:57,862 --> 00:18:00,033
- <i>I am paying attention, but please...</i>
- What?

393
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:02,789
- I am seriously not. I'm just...
- <i>All right.</i>

394
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:05,126
- <i>Curtis... OK, look, you know what...</i>
- Who do you...

395
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,799
<i>I can't... I can't talk
to both of you at the same time.</i>

396
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:09,820
<i>I am getting so distracted.
You know there's too much...</i>

397
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:12,224
<i>Can you just be ready
to go on when we get there?</i>

398
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,507
<i>- OK. I love you so much, Anna.</i>
- OK, I'll see you soon.

399
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:16,566
- <i>Curtis, why...</i>
- Thanks for listening. Bye.

400
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:17,819
<i>I mean...</i>

401
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,035
Thanks.

402
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,756
I didn't get the memo
about the hair brushing.

403
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:34,556
Oh, I'll brush yours the next. OK?

404
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:36,014
Fine.

405
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,524
Can I at least have an Oreo?

406
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:42,655
Oh, sorry, that was the last one.

407
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:45,493
Oh, sorry.

408
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,836
What's going on here?

409
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:52,508
This...

410
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,052
This is getting, like, really weird.

411
00:19:54,136 --> 00:19:56,366
Like, you have your own family.
Can you go back to your own family?

412
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,518
Don't be so rude, Maya.

413
00:19:57,602 --> 00:19:59,438
No. I am sick of her being here
at my house.

414
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:01,526
Like, you are stretching out
my PJ's, Anna.

415
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,947
Maya, stop acting like a baby.

416
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:06,118
You are not a little girl anymore.

417
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,626
What?

418
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:15,219
Oh, my God, I guess that's my parents.

419
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:18,142
OK. I'm sorry, Anna.

420
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,518
No, I get it.

421
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,816
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

422
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:22,942
Bye.

423
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:33,339
Thanks... for having me.

424
00:20:33,422 --> 00:20:34,422
It's all right.

425
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,624
- Hi.
- Hey.

426
00:20:53,421 --> 00:20:54,421
How was it?

427
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:56,803
Good. Good.

428
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:58,262
How was it with Maya?

429
00:20:58,598 --> 00:20:59,598
Good.

430
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:01,563
- Good.
- OK.

431
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:18,722
Oh, no.

432
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:20,976
No...

433
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:22,980
No...

434
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:46,611
Maya, come here.

435
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,380
You can never talk to someone like that,

436
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:58,259
especially to your friend.

437
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:02,560
Yeah, but she was...

438
00:22:02,643 --> 00:22:03,643
No.

439
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:09,615
Anna is going
through a tough time right now,

440
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:12,162
so we gotta be there for her.

441
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:14,207
Mom, I am going
through a tough time right now

442
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,794
and you haven't been there for me.

443
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:17,965
But I am always here for you.

444
00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:19,382
Always.

445
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:21,556
When you said that I am not...

446
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:23,977
your little girl anymore,

447
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:26,481
did you mean that?

448
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:30,489
You're always my little girl.

449
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:36,043
- Mmm.
- Oh...

450
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,636
- Anna.
- Yeah.

451
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:25,517
Can we come in for a minute?

452
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,310
Yeah.

453
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,660
Um...

454
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,541
What's up?

455
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,310
Go ahead.

456
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:53,405
Your dad and I
have something to tell you.

457
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:58,958
I don't know how to say this.

458
00:24:07,016 --> 00:24:10,982
Things with me and your dad
haven't been working...

459
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:13,278
for a long time.

460
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,159
Right, Curtis?

461
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:20,917
That's right.

462
00:24:25,052 --> 00:24:26,931
So, I hate...

463
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:29,728
to tell you this...

464
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:36,448
But we're...

465
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,747
getting a divorce.

466
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:41,959
OK.

467
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:44,592
The retreat...

468
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,514
helped us realize

469
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:50,144
that it's, uh...

470
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:53,526
the right thing to do.

471
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:38,616
