1
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:08,768
OK.

2
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:11,356
- They're gonna be here like any minute.
- I know.

3
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:13,193
Did you bring your mom's shopping bag?

4
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:16,742
- Oh, yes. Chanel, baby...
- Oh, perfect.

5
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:19,790
- You want tape, too?
- Yeah, thanks.

6
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,710
Thank you, madam.

7
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:23,631
OK, so, we have...

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,971
- the milk cups...
- OK, yeah, amazing.

9
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:30,603
- Um, what else do we need?
- OK, we have some clothes.

10
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:31,897
Stevie's gonna be bringing...

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,316
- camera...
- Camera.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,447
Connie can bring clothes
and I have clothes.

13
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:38,452
I just hope that they take
this project seriously

14
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:40,540
'cause osteoporosis is not a joke.

15
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,629
Like my grandmother had it
and devastated my father.

16
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,299
He hasn't really been the same.

17
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:47,386
Hey, Butt Lords.

18
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:50,100
- What are you doing?
- Shuji, go away.

19
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,731
We're working on,
like, a serious project. Hello!

20
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:53,816
Hey, Shuj.

21
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:55,319
What up?

22
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:57,072
Hey, Evan.

23
00:00:57,949 --> 00:00:59,953
- Hey.
- What's up with you?

24
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:02,458
We... we was gonna go see <i>Cast Away</i> again?

25
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,211
I like your hair today.

26
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:07,636
Um, my mum wanted me to give this to you
before we left. Um...

27
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,600
Don't flick me off!

28
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:12,646
Bye, Evan.

29
00:01:13,146 --> 00:01:15,818
- OK, do you, um...
- Your brother is fine.

30
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:18,783
Anna, stop, that's disgusting.

31
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:21,622
Uh, stop! OK, did you bring the snacks?

32
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:22,916
Hell yeah!

33
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,005
- Gushers, cheetos.
- Perfect.

34
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,634
Just like you requested.

35
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:30,491
- Oh, my God! OK, they're here.
- They're here.

36
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:31,576
- They're here. We're good.
- All right, all right, all right.

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,287
- We're good. We're good.
- Yeah, we're good.

38
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:36,192
- You look good. Do I? Mm-hmm.
- You look good. Yeah. Do I? OK.

39
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:39,115
- Um... Chill.
- Shh. Chill.

40
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,045
- Are you ready. One, two, three.
- You ready?

41
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:47,964
Do it.

42
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:51,180
One, two, three.

43
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,767

We had to for school, obviously.

- Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.
- Yeah, obviously.

53
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:23,744
So...

54
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:26,502
Is anyone hungry?

55
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:40,320
- You guys hungry, or like...
- Um...

56
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:42,405
Anna?

57
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:44,076
Like...

58
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:45,955
No, don't... No.

59
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,344
- Do you, like, have more food?
- No.

60
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:55,058
That's not possible.
Uh, can I check the fridge?

61
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,897
Actually my brother
ate everything we have,

62
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:00,820
so, like there's nothing in there.
Literal... There's...

63
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:02,197
It's just on the right.

64
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,285
Ew!

65
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:06,832
Why is there fish heads in here.
Close it! Close it.

66
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,428
Maya, have you any ham?

67
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:21,319
No, do you want me to buy some?

68
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,840
No, it's like...
it's like an inside joke.

69
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:25,118
- Yeah, OK.
- Never mind, I'm not hungry anymore.

70
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:27,915
Should we, like, start the project

71
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,079
- or... We'll start. OK. Get the clothes.
- Yeah, we'll do it, you guys, so...

72
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:32,550
Um, if you want to choose, like,

73
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:35,096
- Spice Girl outfits to be Spice Girls.
- Oh, yeah.

74
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,476
Let's just pick
from what Connie and I brought.

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,396
- Yeah.
- Oh, good idea.

76
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,279
So, just to go over it, you guys,
so, we're the old Spice Girls

77
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:46,828
and we, like, can't sing or dance
'cause we have osteoporosis

78
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:50,126
so, we need milk, so, that we...
And then we drink and we get strong

79
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:51,295
and then we'd fight dance...

80
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,007
OK. I'm Baby.

81
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,428
- I'm Posh.
- I want to be Posh.

82
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:56,932
- Baby.
- Ginger.

83
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,309
- I'm Sporty then.
- OK.

84
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:00,731
OK. I'm Baby. Steve's Ginger,

85
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,403
Anna's Sporty, and Connie's Posh.

86
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:04,781
Wait, I called Posh.

87
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:07,202
<i>My name is Posh and I go to Chanel.</i>

88
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,083
- But you look the most like Scary.
- She does.

89
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,047
Do you have,
like a Sporty outfit, or...

90
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:15,427
This I guess could be Sporty's.

91
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,099
- No, I do.
- Stevie, look.

92
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:19,182
- Look...
- No.

93
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,274
Guys, did you see that? Guys, guys,

94
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:24,654
- you all... OK.
- That literally touched my face.

95
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,616
- Touched my face.
- Guys, stop.

96
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:27,702
We're about to record.

97
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:31,333
So, we have the definition in the dance
but who's gonna bring us milk.

98
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,046
- Not it.
- Not it.

99
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,926
- Maya's it.
- I said "Not it" before all of you.

100
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:37,137
I'll do it.

101
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,766
No it's funny if Maya plays

102
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,286
- the servant and brings us milk.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,189
Wait, why do I have to be the servant?

104
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,959
Because you're like different from us.

105
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:45,672
Like, so, were the Spice girls,
and you are the servant

106
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:46,696
'cause you're like tan.

107
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:49,328
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

108
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:51,750
So, okay that's funny.

109
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:55,609
- No, like, hunch over more.
- Yeah, like, you're old.

110
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,633
Like bent.

111
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:59,933
- You got to go lower. Hunch over.
- Like lower.

112
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,814
- Like this is not funny.
- Yeah.

113
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:05,235
Who wants some milk?

114
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,157
Guido! Guido, bring me some milk!

115
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:09,911
Who's Guido? What's Guido.

116
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,959
Maya's Guido The Gardener
because he's Mexican and she's tan.

117
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:17,134
Tan!

118
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:21,225
<i>Guido, do you want the milk?</i>

119
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:25,066
- <i>Get it, get it? Me want milk...</i>
- Ew! Don't touch us.

120
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,150
You're dirty.

121
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:28,114
Guys, lets start.

122
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:30,368
- OK, yeah.
- OK, get in line.

123
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:32,289
I know. Sorry.

124
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,459
- Sorry.
- OK.

125
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,643
What are you doing? No, you're recording.

126
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,009
Yeah. Guido!

127
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:39,011
- No, I'm...
- You're on camera duty.

128
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:41,182
- Yeah.
- I can record. I'll record.

129
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,269
- No, no. Let her do it.
- OK.

130
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:44,438
Get back...

131
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,251
- I can do it.
- It's... Just push the button.

132
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,880
- I know what button it is...
- She knows.

133
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:48,904
You guys.

134
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:58,926
We're the old Spice Girls
and we have osteoporosis.

135
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,474
A condition where,
um, your bones almost crack

136
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:05,313
because you didn't get your vitamins.
Got milk?

137
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:10,114
Ooh, I'm so old.

138
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,705
Ooh, my back.

139
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:18,966
Oh, thank you.

140
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:37,460
- Five, six, seven, eight. One...
- Five, six, seven, eight.

141
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:44,660
And then it's kind of doing this
at the end.

142
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:45,684
Yeah, like this. Yeah.

143
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,775
But it was like,
sometimes it looked like this,

144
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:50,654
but it was...

145
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,198
it was so fun.

146
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,453
And we filmed it, on... And it was like,

147
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:57,042
- Stevie, Jessica, Connie. Yeah.
- Oh, my God,

148
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,335
actually Maya did this

149
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,465
- really funny character...
- No.

150
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:01,944
- For that...
- I'm not doing it.

151
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:04,139
It was so funny.

152
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:05,224
I'd want to see it.

153
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:06,770
OK. I'll do it.

154
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:09,692
- OK. It's really funny, but it was like...
- So funny.

155
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:11,463
- It's like...
- They made me do it,

156
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:14,284
and I, like, didn't know what I was...
uh, I'll do it. OK. Like...

157
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:20,881
<i>Oh, Guido, you want
the milk for you... I make the cake.</i>

158
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,094
Oh, my God.

159
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,641
- It's like...
- OK, you racist.

160
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:29,481
- It's not racist.
- They were, like, joking. I don't know.

161
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,694
Wait, did... did you
just make fun of Mexicans?

162
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:34,032
I wasn't... I didn't say I was Mexican,

163
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:35,243
like, they told me I was

164
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:37,706
- and it was like a joke.
- So, wait, wait, wait. So...

165
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,459
In this video project,

166
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:41,088
you play servant

167
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:43,353
and you're serving all your white friends?

168
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:44,971
Hmm-hmm.

169
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,852
And she put a blanket
over Ojichan's shrine.

170
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:51,275
You don't mess with Ojichan's shrine.

171
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:52,193
I didn't.

172
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:53,798
- I just didn't want to scare them.
- Oh, my God.

173
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:56,703
Why are you so ashamed of being Japanese?

174
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:58,122
I'm not.

175
00:07:58,582 --> 00:08:02,297
I'm like barely Japanese,
and I'm cool with it.

176
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,719
Guido is fucked up, too.

177
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:06,346
<i>Watch your language.</i>

178
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:09,854
Mom? What?

179
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,979
Anna, you are more fucked up
for making her do that.

180
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,029
Mom?

181
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:17,118
Good job, racists.

182
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,954
<i>As a great beacon light of hope,</i>

183
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:24,127
<i>the greatest demonstration for freedom</i>

184
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,381
<i>in the history of our nation.</i>

185
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,972
<i>It came as a joyous daybreak</i>

186
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:35,609
<i>to end the long night of their captivity.</i>

187
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:42,539
"Brings attention

188
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,879
to reality that teenagers
are in denial about."

189
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,462
<i>Oh, dude!</i>

190
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:29,800
- I just caught a Psyduck!
- OK.

191
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:31,136
You're such an idiot.

192
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,184
- Let's see it.
- I got you. I got you so good.

193
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,729
You do this every single time.

194
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,398
Dude, it's like it's two time.

195
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:39,360
It's not funny.

196
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:42,325
I get you every time.
It's always funny.

197
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,878
Can we help you?

198
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:50,967
<i>No, can I help you?</i>

199
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:53,055
Oh, we don't...
we don't speak Japanese.

200
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:54,932
Me neither.

201
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:02,073
No!
God, you're paying for that.

202
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:12,009
Hi. Um, is the principal here, please.
It's important, please.

203
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:14,347
The principal isn't in right now.

204
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:16,059
Is there something I can help you.

205
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:22,530
Um, yeah, actually
I... I've been noticing some, um...

206
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:24,200
racism in society

207
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,706
and I would like to report it.

208
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:30,252
OK, kiddo.

209
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,930
- Oh, Principal Ravage.
- Ah.

210
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:37,226
Um, I just have a quick thought for you.

211
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:40,609
- Um...
- Yeah, uh-huh. Sure. What?

212
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,447
Um, I've been noticing
a bit of a pattern in this school

213
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:44,571
- which is, um...
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,539
Um, racism.

215
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,503
And also separate se-segregation.

216
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,593
And I just think it needs fixings, so...

217
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:57,726
Uh-huh. Well, thank you
for bringing this to my attention,

218
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,228
Anna,

219
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:01,483
but I can't tell kids
who to spend time with.

220
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,821
And I hear that. I really do, but...

221
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,744
actually asked Jeeves last night
for some ideas.

222
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,627
And I'm thinking of like a demonstration
or something, you know, like...

223
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,756
they do organize drunk driving scenes

224
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,010
to show kids,
like why not to drink and drive,

225
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,698
and I think we can do like the same thing.

226
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:19,102
Uh, you know what? I hear you,

227
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:22,149
but these tend to work themselves out.

228
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,487
Sometimes they don't
and you need a demonstration.

229
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:26,867
OK.

230
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,453
Great.

231
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:31,126
I guess it's up to me, you dick.

232
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:36,844
Wake up!

233
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,269
So, it'll just be kind of a favor,

234
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:43,526
um, and it wouldn't interfere
with drama rehearsal after school at all.

235
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,530
It actually be like...

236
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:47,491
now-ish.

237
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:49,243
Um...

238
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:54,464
So, yeah? Just see,
you think of this as a script

239
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,596
and if you're him...

240
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:00,307
Hi.

241
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:01,896
- Hi.
- Hi.

242
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:03,816
Hi!
- Hey, darling.

243
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,572
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm OK.

244
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:08,534
I don't know, I'm just a little like...

245
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,997
- blah, after last night.
- Yeah.

246
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,376
I know what you mean, it was crazy.

247
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,466
- Yeah, it was just weird.
- It's kind of eye-opening for me.

248
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,930
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I'm sorry.

249
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:21,945
And I got a little something
for you later.

250
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:23,063
What do you have?

251
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,942
- OK, party people...
- A surprise?

252
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:28,533
Today we're talking
about the late Thomas Jefferson.

253
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,745
What do we know about the great TJ? Yes.

254
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:32,833
Yeah, he's dead.

255
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:35,922
That is true. OK.

256
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:37,634
Yes. Gabe again.

257
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,930
Uh, he loves grilled bananas.

258
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:42,003
I don't think that's true, Gabe.

259
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,270
Bless you.

260
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:45,942
You don't know what I know.

261
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:48,739
OK, I do know
that he was a Founding Father.

262
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:50,407
What...

263
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:52,454
He was a disgusting slave owner.

264
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:02,224
Maya is Japanese.

265
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:05,063
That's so weird.

266
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:09,948
Yeah, that is weird. I bet she eats...

267
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,956
I bet she eats all kinds of gross foods.

268
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:16,419
Fish-heads. Ew!

269
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,006
No, I don't.

270
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,222
And this, you guys has been
an example of racism.

271
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:24,937
And I would just like everybody
to acknowledge that

272
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,694
- and I see that happening in our school...
- I am Japanese.

273
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,740
So, um, where was I?

274
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:34,413
- I was just saying that in America...
- Maya, me love you long time!

275
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:36,961
- You sound Jamaican...
- OK.

276
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,673
That's not part of this.

277
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,512
Hey, Lucy Liu,
can I get a $5 hand-job?

278
00:14:41,595 --> 00:14:44,433
You're Japanese?
No shit, Maya, I'm American.

279
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:45,955
- Her eyes are always closed.
- Hey, hey,

280
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:47,147
what's going on here?

281
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:50,822
Everyone, everyone,
get back to your classes.

282
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:52,282
What's going on?

283
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:55,414
Someone put this on my locker.

284
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,302
Who is responsible for this?

285
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,481
Well, it's...

286
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:10,152
Seriously?

287
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:13,868
Oh, Miss Kone, come on, come on.

288
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,330
We're going to wait in here
till Mr. Ravage comes.

289
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:18,562
- Maya, it was...
- We're going to have to call your parents,

290
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:19,921
you know, that was a hate crime.

291
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:21,842
- It...
- Come on, come on, get in there.

292
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:23,470
Be quiet and sit down.

293
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:28,606
I thought they were friends.

294
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,192
Anna.

295
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:33,073
- Kone.
- Mom.

296
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:35,035
She is my best friend

297
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:36,705
and her name is Maya

298
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:38,626
and just so you know

299
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:41,422
the only reason I did that
was to bring attention because

300
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,554
Becca and Stevie and Connie
were treating her differently.

301
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:47,560
All right.
Let's not point the finger, all right?

302
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,898
This is about you and all this racism.

303
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:52,904
Honey, I taught you this, no?

304
00:15:53,697 --> 00:15:55,737
- I'm disappointed.
- That's what I'm trying to say.

305
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,914
I'm trying to bring
attention to the issue.

306
00:15:57,997 --> 00:16:00,545
Don't be a know it all. You're 13.

307
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:03,174
I... I think, uh, some...

308
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:06,180
major apologizing is in order.

309
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:08,476
See, this is why she doesn't take
anything seriously.

310
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,081
- Why?
- You just want her to apologize

311
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:11,626
go through the motions of apologizing

312
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,672
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
and then you're gonna go home

313
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:15,456
and you'll watch
<i>The Simpsons</i> with her later.

314
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,055
- The point is, then she doesn't learn...
- What's wrong with <i>The Simpsons?</i>

315
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,628
To take it seriously.
Jesus fucking Christ, Curtis.

316
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:24,091
- Mom, we're in school, you can't say...
- Who gives a fuck?

317
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,264
OK, uh, I wanna thank you both...

318
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:29,351
so much for coming down here today.

319
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:33,401
And as for you, Miss Kone,
I will see you in detention.

320
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:38,871
I'm not eating.

321
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:41,960
I'm not eating until racism is over.

322
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,467
You're going on a hunger strike
like Gandhi?

323
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,933
- What?
- Oh, for heaven sakes.

324
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:01,708
Geez, dummy.

325
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:04,921
What happened?

326
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:10,433
Nothing.

327
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:16,905
Come on. Lets' go.

328
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,297
Here you all go.

329
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:29,263
You know what?

330
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,647
Take a nice long look at yourself,

331
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:35,610
and your bigotry.

332
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:43,458
It's your problem.

333
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,172
Anybody else, anybody else wanna test me?

334
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:49,428
- Boom, bitch.
- Suck my pubes, bitch.

335
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,186
- Yo, what up, Shuji?
- What's up?

336
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:54,689
What's up, Shuj?

337
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:58,572
Um, welcome to the park.

338
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:00,868
Yo, this is my sister, Maya.

339
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:03,162
Yo, what up, Maya?

340
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:04,626
What's up, Evan?

341
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,130
- Let's sit down.
- So...

342
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:09,969
Some fucked up shit happened to her today.

343
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:13,852
Someone wrote "I'm Japanese" on her locker

344
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:15,815
and a bunch of kids
called her a dirty Jap.

345
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:17,902
Yo, that's fucked up.

346
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,323
This is Andy Kim. He's in my grade.

347
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:21,448
What's up?

348
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:23,789
Yo, you're trying to hit this, though?

349
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:25,992
- This tree is hella tight, dawg.
- Yeah, let's do it.

350
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:43,662
Yo, Maya, you wanna hit this?

351
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,511
- Hey, yo!
- No, wait.

352
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,640
I'm just kidding.

353
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:56,980
- Hey, yo, she never hit a pipe though.
- Yes, I have.

354
00:18:57,063 --> 00:19:00,613
Like freaking dank faded all the time.

355
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:01,696
Oh!

356
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:05,288
Um, you know what?
On second thought I feel like...

357
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:09,756
I normally would, but I just,
during school, like shouldn't.

358
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,385
- You know?
- Staying sober for school.

359
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:13,929
I respect that.

360
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:17,270
Uh, Shuji, you wanna hit this?
- Yeah. All right.

361
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:24,243
Oh, God. Hey, Koney.
Why aren't you at lunch?

362
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,330
Honey-baked ham day.

363
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,419
I'm just kind of busy,
like fixing the school.

364
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:35,431
Oh, well, actually
that's not really a bad idea

365
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:37,435
to take a look at yourself
especially when you

366
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:39,858
think something's everybody else's fault.

367
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
OK.

368
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:44,313
Have you seen Maya?
She's, like, mad at me or whatever.

369
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:47,181
Uh, sweetie pie, why don't you sit down
and have some lunch.

370
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:48,876
You don't seem like yourself today.

371
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,840
I'm on a hunger strike
until racism is over.

372
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,598
Oh. Uh, you... you want half of this?

373
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:57,727
Because that other thing's

374
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,810
gonna take a sec.

375
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,398
What kind is it?

376
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,906
It's... It's kind of a meat.

377
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:08,582
Ham. There might be cheese in it.

378
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,146
- Just keep it. Just keep it.
- No, no. It's OK. I'm good.

379
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,090
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

380
00:20:13,842 --> 00:20:15,428
- Yeah, right.
- Thanks, Jan.

381
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:18,894
Why'd they switch out Aunt Viv?
Think about it.

382
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,106
She got that lighter skin, that's right.

383
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,069
Yo, Maya needs justice, man.

384
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:26,450
She needs to, like,
put her racist ass friend in check.

385
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,247
She's not really
that racist, she's like...

386
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,335
a good person.

387
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,089
No, that shit that she said to you

388
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,411
was some of the most fucked up stuff
that I've ever heard.

389
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,349
I bet my sister doesn't even know
what racism is.

390
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:41,146
That is such bullshit. Yes, I do.

391
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,486
It's like when you're mean to people

392
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:47,785
'cause of their skin color
and like lynch them.

393
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:49,998
No, it's not always as obvious as that.

394
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,588
Yeah, Maya, think about it.

395
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:56,176
<i>Use your head.</i>

396
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:59,474
<i>- Do your parents own the cleaners?
- You look dirty.</i>

397
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,728
<i>When did you immigrate here?</i>

398
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:02,147
<i>I've never met
an oriental before.</i>

399
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,359
- <i>Say something in Chinese.
- Konnichiwa.</i>

400
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:08,492
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What the fuck, dude.

401
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,371
- Come on.
- What? It's disgu...

402
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:11,791
Ah!

403
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,920
Sorry, it happens sometimes.

404
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:15,505
You see now.

405
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,829
You got to speak up for yourself.

406
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,345
Yeah.

407
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:21,644
You got to beat up your friend.

408
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,650
Yeah.

409
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:31,330
Hey, let me hit that.

410
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,623
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

411
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,708
Hey, no...

412
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,760
- Don't... Maya!
- Fucking... Jesus.

413
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:41,431
Let's do it.

414
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,546
I have to beat you up.

415
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:19,927
I'm gonna eat you up.

416
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:22,725
I'm gonna beat your ass now.

417
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:24,729
I'm gonna eat your ass.

418
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:27,818
Hello, 'Na.

419
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:34,747
May.

420
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,003
Hey, 'Na.

421
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:38,963
I...

422
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:41,428
- Do it.
- I, uh...

423
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:47,315
- I have to beat your white ass up...
- White ass up.

424
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:49,442
Now.

425
00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:53,954
Follow me, bitch.

426
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,711
OK.

427
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:01,928
Oh, yeah, you got this, Maya.

428
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:03,347
Yeah, come on.

429
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,978
They want you to really punch me, so...

430
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:07,480
Stand up for yourself.

431
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:09,023
Go!

432
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:12,282
Come on! Get angry.

433
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Hit her.

434
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,133
Yeah.

435
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,811
- Go!
- I can't believe you fucking did that!

436
00:23:26,894 --> 00:23:28,188
I was trying to help.

437
00:23:28,314 --> 00:23:30,318
By telling everyone I'm Asian.

438
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,365
They already freaking know. Am I right?

439
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:36,163
I know, I mean, duh,
like I know I'm Asian,

440
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:38,853
- but I'm more than that.
- I know and that's what I was trying to

441
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:39,795
- say, like...
- Yeah.

442
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:42,199
You just shouldn't hide it
and I just thought that I was...

443
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,887
celebrating your heritage.

444
00:23:44,513 --> 00:23:47,811
That is so easy for you to say.
You don't know what it's like to be me.

445
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:50,817
You're right. I don't. You're right.

446
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:54,992
OK, and I wanna choose
which Spice Girl I'm gonna be.

447
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:57,163
I know, you... you should.

448
00:23:57,205 --> 00:24:00,044
And I should've told them
that you are Posh Spice.

449
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:02,298
- I should've, OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

450
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,052
And Guido's fucked up.

451
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:06,431
I don't wanna punch you.

452
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:09,814
I don't want you to punch me either.

453
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:13,195
Please.

454
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:16,536
Yeah, you punch that racist.

455
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:18,495
Hit her.

456
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:27,516
- Five...
- Six...

457
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,689
- Seven...
- Eight...

458
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,116
What the hell is this?

459
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:58,160
- Boo!
- Boo!

460
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:59,997
It's not fighting.
You guys are hugging.

461
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,251
Let's get out of here.

462
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:15,110
They don't even know how to do it.

463
00:25:15,236 --> 00:25:17,950
Like, I feel like
I was going so much harder...

464
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:21,039
- That guy...
- He got so freaked out.

465
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,630
Are you sure, like,
that I didn't hurt you at all?

466
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:27,134
I was, like, rough

467
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:28,761
and tumble.

468
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:30,892
It's crazy. Ma... Ow!

469
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:32,521
You know that scares me.

470
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:34,397
Hey, Shuji.

471
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,067
What's up?

472
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:38,323
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

473
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:43,543
And I know that you probably hate me now
and I understand why.

474
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,672
I knew she wasn't gonna hit you, so...

475
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:47,425
That's a lie.

476
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:51,308
- I was so freaking... I was like...
- Maya.

477
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:53,435
I was like...

478
00:25:58,488 --> 00:25:59,825
Dude, your Japanese is so bad.

479
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,453
No, it isn't.

480
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:04,000
- That's so mean.
- I have no idea what you guys are saying

481
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,629
but I just literally love you.

482
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,828
