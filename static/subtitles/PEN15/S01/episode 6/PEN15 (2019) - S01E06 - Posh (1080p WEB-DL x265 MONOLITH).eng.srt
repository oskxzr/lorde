1
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:09,768
OK.

2
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:12,356
- They're gonna be here like any minute.
- I know.

3
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:14,193
Did you bring your mom's shopping bag?

4
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:17,742
- Oh, yes. Chanel, baby...
- Oh, perfect.

5
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:20,790
- You want tape, too?
- Yeah, thanks.

6
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:22,710
Thank you, madam.

7
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:24,631
OK, so, we have...

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,971
- the milk cups...
- OK, yeah, amazing.

9
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,603
- Um, what else do we need?
- OK, we have some clothes.

10
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:32,897
Stevie's gonna be bringing...

11
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:34,316
- camera...
- Camera.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,447
Connie can bring clothes
and I have clothes.

13
00:00:37,532 --> 00:00:39,451
I just hope that they take
this project seriously

14
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,540
'cause osteoporosis is not a joke.

15
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:44,629
Like my grandmother had it
and devastated my father.

16
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,299
He hasn't really been the same.

17
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:48,386
Hey, Butt Lords.

18
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:51,100
- What are you doing?
- Shuji, go away.

19
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:53,731
We're working on,
like, a serious project. Hello!

20
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:54,816
Hey, Shuj.

21
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:56,319
What up?

22
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:58,072
Hey, Evan.

23
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,953
- Hey.
- What's up with you?

24
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:03,458
We... we was gonna go see <i>Cast Away</i> again?

25
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:05,211
I like your hair today.

26
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:08,636
Um, my mum wanted me to give this to you
before we left. Um...

27
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,600
Don't flick me off!

28
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:13,646
Bye, Evan.

29
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:16,818
- OK, do you, um...
- Your brother is fine.

30
00:01:16,902 --> 00:01:19,783
Anna, stop, that's disgusting.

31
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:22,622
Uh, stop! OK, did you bring the snacks?

32
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:23,916
Hell yeah!

33
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,005
- Gushers, cheetos.
- Perfect.

34
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:28,634
Just like you requested.

35
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:31,430
- Oh, my God! OK, they're here.
- They're here.

36
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:32,517
- They're here. We're good.
- All right, all right, all right.

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,228
- We're good. We're good.
- Yeah, we're good.

38
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:37,192
- You look good. Do I? Mm-hmm.
- You look good. Yeah. Do I? OK.

39
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:40,115
- Um... Chill.
- Shh. Chill.

40
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:47,045
- Are you ready. One, two, three.
- You ready?

41
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:48,841
Do it.

42
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:52,180
One, two, three.

43
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,767
Hey.

44
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:17,648
Thanks for, like coming over, you guys.

45
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:20,403
We had to for school, obviously.

46
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:23,034
- Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.
- Yeah, obviously.

47
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,579
So...

48
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:27,502
Is anyone hungry?

49
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:41,320
- You guys hungry, or like...
- Um...

50
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:43,241
Anna?

51
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:44,953
Like...

52
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:46,873
No, don't... No.

53
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,344
- Do you, like, have more food?
- No.

54
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:56,058
That's not possible.
Uh, can I check the fridge?

55
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:58,897
Actually my brother
ate everything we have,

56
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:01,820
so, like there's nothing in there.
Literal... There's...

57
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:03,197
It's just on the right.

58
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,285
Ew!

59
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,832
Why is there fish heads in here.
Close it! Close it.

60
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,428
Maya, have you any ham?

61
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:22,319
No, do you want me to buy some?

62
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,780
No, it's like...
it's like an inside joke.

63
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:26,118
- Yeah, OK.
- Never mind, I'm not hungry anymore.

64
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:28,915
Should we, like, start the project

65
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,755
- or... We'll start. OK. Get the clothes.
- Yeah, we'll do it, you guys, so...

66
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,550
Um, if you want to choose, like,

67
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:36,096
- Spice Girl outfits to be Spice Girls.
- Oh, yeah.

68
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,476
Let's just pick
from what Connie and I brought.

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,396
- Yeah.
- Oh, good idea.

70
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,279
So, just to go over it, you guys,
so, we're the old Spice Girls

71
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:47,828
and we, like, can't sing or dance
'cause we have osteoporosis

72
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:51,126
so, we need milk, so, that we...
And then we drink and we get strong

73
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,295
and then we'd fight dance...

74
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,007
OK. I'm Baby.

75
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,428
- I'm Posh.
- I want to be Posh.

76
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:57,932
- Baby.
- Ginger.

77
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:59,309
- I'm Sporty then.
- OK.

78
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:01,731
OK. I'm Baby. Steve's Ginger,

79
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,403
Anna's Sporty, and Connie's Posh.

80
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:05,781
Wait, I called Posh.

81
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:08,202
<i>My name is Posh and I go to Chanel.</i>

82
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,083
- But you look the most like Scary.
- She does.

83
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,047
Do you have,
like a Sporty outfit, or...

84
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:16,427
This I guess could be Sporty's.

85
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,099
- No, I do.
- Stevie, look.

86
00:04:19,182 --> 00:04:20,017
- Look...
- No.

87
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,274
Guys, did you see that? Guys, guys,

88
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:25,654
- you all... OK.
- That literally touched my face.

89
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:27,616
- Touched my face.
- Guys, stop.

90
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:28,702
We're about to record.

91
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:32,333
So, we have the definition in the dance
but who's gonna bring us milk.

92
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,046
- Not it.
- Not it.

93
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,926
- Maya's it.
- I said "Not it" before all of you.

94
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:38,137
I'll do it.

95
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,766
No it's funny if Maya plays

96
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:40,976
- the servant and brings us milk.
- Yeah.

97
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,189
Wait, why do I have to be the servant?

98
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,942
Because you're like different from us.

99
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:46,613
Like, so, were the Spice girls,
and you are the servant

100
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:47,531
'cause you're like tan.

101
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,328
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

102
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:52,750
So, okay that's funny.

103
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,549
- No, like, hunch over more.
- Yeah, like, you're old.

104
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:57,551
Like bent.

105
00:04:58,427 --> 00:05:00,933
- You got to go lower. Hunch over.
- Like lower.

106
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,814
- Like this is not funny.
- Yeah.

107
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,235
Who wants some milk?

108
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,157
Guido! Guido, bring me some milk!

109
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:10,911
Who's Guido? What's Guido.

110
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:13,959
Maya's Guido The Gardener
because he's Mexican and she's tan.

111
00:05:15,796 --> 00:05:18,134
Tan!

112
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,225
<i>Guido, do you want the milk?</i>

113
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:26,066
- <i>Get it, get it? Me want milk...</i>
- Ew! Don't touch us.

114
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,026
You're dirty.

115
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:29,114
Guys, lets start.

116
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:31,368
- OK, yeah.
- OK, get in line.

117
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:33,289
I know. Sorry.

118
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:35,459
- Sorry.
- OK.

119
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,548
What are you doing? No, you're recording.

120
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:39,009
Yeah. Guido!

121
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:40,011
- No, I'm...
- You're on camera duty.

122
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:42,182
- Yeah.
- I can record. I'll record.

123
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:44,269
- No, no. Let her do it.
- OK.

124
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:45,438
Get back...

125
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:47,233
- I can do it.
- It's... Just push the button.

126
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,820
- I know what button it is...
- She knows.

127
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:49,822
...you guys.

128
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:59,926
We're the old Spice Girls
and we have osteoporosis.

129
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,474
A condition where,
um, your bones almost crack

130
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:06,313
because you didn't get your vitamins.
Got milk?

131
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:11,114
Ooh, I'm so old.

132
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:14,705
Ooh, my back.

133
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:19,966
Oh, thank you.

134
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:38,460
- Five, six, seven, eight. One...
- Five, six, seven, eight.

135
00:06:43,972 --> 00:06:45,600
And then it's kind of doing this
at the end.

136
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:46,602
Yeah, like this. Yeah.

137
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:49,775
But it was like,
sometimes it looked like this,

138
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:51,654
but it was...

139
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,198
it was so fun.

140
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,453
And we filmed it, on... And it was like,

141
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:58,042
- Stevie, Jessica, Connie. Yeah.
- Oh, my God,

142
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,335
actually Maya did this

143
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,465
- really funny character...
- No.

144
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:02,718
- ...for that...
- I'm not doing it.

145
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:05,139
It was so funny.

146
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,224
I'd want to see it.

147
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:07,770
OK. I'll do it.

148
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,692
- OK. It's really funny, but it was like...
- So funny.

149
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:12,361
- It's like...
- They made me do it,

150
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:15,284
and I, like, didn't know what I was...
uh, I'll do it. OK. Like...

151
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:21,881
<i>Oh, Guido, you want
the milk for you... I make the cake.</i>

152
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,094
Oh, my God.

153
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,641
- It's like...
- OK, you racist.

154
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:30,481
- It's not racist.
- They were, like, joking. I don't know.

155
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,694
Wait, did... did you
just make fun of Mexicans?

156
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,032
I wasn't... I didn't say I was Mexican,

157
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:36,243
like, they told me I was

158
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:38,706
- and it was like a joke.
- So, wait, wait, wait. So...

159
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,459
In this video project,

160
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,088
you play servant

161
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:44,259
and you're serving all your white friends?

162
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:45,971
Hmm-hmm.

163
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,852
And she put a blanket
over Ojichan's shrine.

164
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,275
You don't mess with Ojichan's shrine.

165
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:53,193
I didn't.

166
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:54,738
- I just didn't want to scare them.
- Oh, my God.

167
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:57,703
Why are you so ashamed of being Japanese?

168
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,122
I'm not.

169
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:03,297
I'm like barely Japanese,
and I'm cool with it.

170
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:05,719
Guido is fucked up, too.

171
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:07,346
<i>Watch your language.</i>

172
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:10,854
Mom? What?

173
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:13,902
Anna, you are more fucked up
for making her do that.

174
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,029
Mom?

175
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:18,118
Good job, racists.

176
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,954
<i>...as a great beacon light of hope,</i>

177
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,127
<i>the greatest demonstration for freedom</i>

178
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,381
<i>in the history of our nation.</i>

179
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,972
<i>It came as a joyous daybreak</i>

180
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:36,609
<i>to end the long night of their captivity.</i>

181
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:43,539
"Brings attention

182
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,879
to reality that teenagers
are in denial about."

183
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,462
<i>Oh, dude!</i>

184
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,800
- I just caught a Psyduck!
- OK.

185
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:32,136
You're such an idiot.

186
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:35,184
- Let's see it.
- I got you. I got you so good.

187
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,729
You do this every single time.

188
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:38,398
Dude, it's like it's two time.

189
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:40,360
It's not funny.

190
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:43,325
I get you every time.
It's always funny.

191
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,878
Can we help you?

192
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:51,967
<i>No, can I help you?</i>

193
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:54,055
Oh, we don't...
we don't speak Japanese.

194
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:55,892
Me neither.

195
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:03,073
No!
God, you're paying for that.

196
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,009
Hi. Um, is the principal here, please.
It's important, please.

197
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:15,347
The principal isn't in right now.

198
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,059
Is there something I can help you.

199
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:23,530
Um, yeah, actually
I... I've been noticing some, um...

200
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,200
racism in society

201
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,706
and I would like to report it.

202
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:31,087
OK, kiddo.

203
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,930
- Oh, Principal Ravage.
- Ah.

204
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:38,226
Um, I just have a quick thought for you.

205
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:41,609
- Um...
- Yeah, uh-huh. Sure. What?

206
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,447
Um, I've been noticing
a bit of a pattern in this school

207
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:45,490
- which is, um...
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:48,539
Um, racism.

209
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:51,503
And also separate se-segregation.

210
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,593
And I just think it needs fixings, so...

211
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:58,726
Uh-huh. Well, thank you
for bringing this to my attention,

212
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,228
Anna,

213
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,483
but I can't tell kids
who to spend time with.

214
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,821
And I hear that. I really do, but...

215
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,744
actually asked Jeeves last night
for some ideas.

216
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,627
And I'm thinking of like a demonstration
or something, you know, like...

217
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,756
they do organize drunk driving scenes

218
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,010
to show kids,
like why not to drink and drive,

219
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,639
and I think we can do like the same thing.

220
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:20,102
Uh, you know what? I hear you,

221
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:23,149
but these tend to work themselves out.

222
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,487
Sometimes they don't
and you need a demonstration.

223
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:27,867
OK.

224
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:29,453
Great.

225
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:32,126
I guess it's up to me, you dick.

226
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:37,804
Wake up!

227
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,269
So, it'll just be kind of a favor,

228
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:44,526
um, and it wouldn't interfere
with drama rehearsal after school at all.

229
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:46,530
It actually be like...

230
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:48,491
now-ish.

231
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,120
Um...

232
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:55,464
So, yeah? Just see,
you think of this as a script

233
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,596
and if you're him...

234
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:01,184
Hi.

235
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:02,896
- Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:04,816
Hi!
- Hey, darling.

237
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,572
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm OK.

238
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:09,534
I don't know, I'm just a little like...

239
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,997
- blah, after last night.
- Yeah.

240
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,376
I know what you mean, it was crazy.

241
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,466
- Yeah, it was just weird.
- It's kind of eye-opening for me.

242
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,930
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I'm sorry.

243
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:22,936
And I got a little something
for you later.

244
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:24,063
What do you have?

245
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,942
- OK, party people...
- A surprise?

246
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:29,533
...today we're talking
about the late Thomas Jefferson.

247
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:31,745
What do we know about the great TJ? Yes.

248
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:33,833
Yeah, he's dead.

249
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:36,922
That is true. OK.

250
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:38,634
Yes. Gabe again.

251
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,930
Uh, he loves grilled bananas.

252
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:42,976
I don't think that's true, Gabe.

253
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,188
Bless you.

254
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:46,942
You don't know what I know.

255
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:49,739
OK, I do know
that he was a Founding Father.

256
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:51,367
What...

257
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,454
He was a disgusting slave owner.

258
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:03,224
Maya is Japanese.

259
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,063
That's so weird.

260
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:10,948
Yeah, that is weird. I bet she eats...

261
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,956
I bet she eats all kinds of gross foods.

262
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,419
Fish-heads. Ew!

263
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:19,006
No, I don't.

264
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,222
And this, you guys has been
an example of racism.

265
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,937
And I would just like everybody
to acknowledge that

266
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,694
- and I see that happening in our school...
- I am Japanese.

267
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:31,740
So, um, where was I?

268
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:35,413
- I was just saying that in America...
- Maya, me love you long time!

269
00:14:35,497 --> 00:14:37,961
- You sound Jamaican...
- OK.

270
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,673
That's not part of this.

271
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:42,512
Hey, Lucy Liu,
can I get a $5 hand-job?

272
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:45,433
You're Japanese?
No shit, Maya, I'm American.

273
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,853
- Her eyes are always closed.
- Hey, hey,

274
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,147
what's going on here?

275
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:51,822
Everyone, everyone,
get back to your classes.

276
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:53,282
What's going on?

277
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:56,414
Someone put this on my locker.

278
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:03,302
Who is responsible for this?

279
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,481
Well, it's...

280
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,152
Seriously?

281
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,868
Oh, Miss Kone, come on, come on.

282
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:17,330
We're going to wait in here
till Mr. Ravage comes.

283
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:19,502
- Maya, it was...
- We're going to have to call your parents,

284
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,921
you know, that was a hate crime.

285
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,842
- It...
- Come on, come on, get in there.

286
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,470
Be quiet and sit down.

287
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,606
I thought they were friends.

288
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,192
Anna.

289
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:34,073
- Kone.
- Mom.

290
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,035
She is my best friend

291
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:37,705
and her name is Maya

292
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:39,626
and just so you know

293
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:42,422
the only reason I did that
was to bring attention because

294
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,554
Becca and Stevie and Connie
were treating her differently.

295
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:48,560
All right.
Let's not point the finger, all right?

296
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:50,898
This is about you and all this racism.

297
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:53,904
Honey, I taught you this, no?

298
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:56,701
- I'm disappointed.
- That's what I'm trying to say.

299
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,914
I'm trying to bring
attention to the issue.

300
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:01,545
Don't be a know it all. You're 13.

301
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,174
I... I think, uh, some...

302
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:07,180
major apologizing is in order.

303
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:09,476
See, this is why she doesn't take
anything seriously.

304
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:11,063
- Why?
- You just want her to apologize

305
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:12,567
go through the motions of apologizing

306
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,571
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
and then you're gonna go home

307
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:16,198
and you'll watch
<i>The Simpsons</i> with her later.

308
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,996
- The point is, then she doesn't learn...
- What's wrong with <i>The Simpsons?</i>

309
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,628
...to take it seriously.
Jesus fucking Christ, Curtis.

310
00:16:22,712 --> 00:16:25,091
- Mom, we're in school, you can't say...
- Who gives a fuck?

311
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:28,264
OK, uh, I wanna thank you both...

312
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,351
so much for coming down here today.

313
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:34,401
And as for you, Miss Kone,
I will see you in detention.

314
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:39,871
I'm not eating.

315
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm not eating until racism is over.

316
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,467
You're going on a hunger strike
like Gandhi?

317
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,933
- What?
- Oh, for heaven sakes.

318
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:02,708
Geez, dummy.

319
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:05,839
What happened?

320
00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:11,433
Nothing.

321
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:17,905
Come on. Lets' go.

322
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,297
Here you all go.

323
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:30,263
You know what?

324
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,647
Take a nice long look at yourself,

325
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:36,610
and your bigotry.

326
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:44,458
It's your problem.

327
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:47,172
Anybody else, anybody else wanna test me?

328
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:50,428
- Boom, bitch.
- Suck my pubes, bitch.

329
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:54,186
- Yo, what up, Shuji?
- What's up?

330
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:55,689
What's up, Shuj?

331
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:59,572
Um, welcome to the park.

332
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:01,868
Yo, this is my sister, Maya.

333
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:04,081
Yo, what up, Maya?

334
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:05,626
What's up, Evan?

335
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,130
- Let's sit down.
- So...

336
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:10,969
Some fucked up shit happened to her today.

337
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:14,852
Someone wrote "I'm Japanese" on her locker

338
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:16,815
and a bunch of kids
called her a dirty Jap.

339
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,902
Yo, that's fucked up.

340
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:21,323
This is Andy Kim. He's in my grade.

341
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:22,325
What's up?

342
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:24,789
Yo, you're trying to hit this, though?

343
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,960
- This tree is hella tight, dawg.
- Yeah, let's do it.

344
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,662
Yo, Maya, you wanna hit this?

345
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:52,511
- Hey, yo!
- No, wait.

346
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,640
I'm just kidding.

347
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:57,980
- Hey, yo, she never hit a pipe though.
- Yes, I have.

348
00:18:58,063 --> 00:19:01,613
Like freaking dank faded all the time.

349
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:02,531
Oh!

350
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:06,288
Um, you know what?
On second thought I feel like...

351
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:10,756
I normally would, but I just,
during school, like shouldn't.

352
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,385
- You know?
- Staying sober for school.

353
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:14,806
I respect that.

354
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:18,270
Uh, Shuji, you wanna hit this?
- Yeah. All right.

355
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:25,243
Oh, God. Hey, Koney.
Why aren't you at lunch?

356
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,330
Honey-baked ham day.

357
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,419
I'm just kind of busy,
like fixing the school.

358
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:36,431
Oh, well, actually
that's not really a bad idea

359
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:38,435
to take a look at yourself
especially when you

360
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:40,858
think something's everybody else's fault.

361
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,277
OK.

362
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:45,241
Have you seen Maya?
She's, like, mad at me or whatever.

363
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,122
Uh, sweetie pie, why don't you sit down
and have some lunch.

364
00:19:48,205 --> 00:19:49,876
You don't seem like yourself today.

365
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:52,840
I'm on a hunger strike
until racism is over.

366
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:56,598
Oh. Uh, you... you want half of this?

367
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:58,727
Because that other thing's

368
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,729
gonna take a sec.

369
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:02,358
What kind is it?

370
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,906
It's... It's kind of a meat.

371
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:09,582
Ham. There might be cheese in it.

372
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:12,086
- Just keep it. Just keep it.
- No, no. It's OK. I'm good.

373
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,090
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

374
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:16,428
- Yeah, right.
- Thanks, Jan.

375
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:19,894
Why'd they switch out Aunt Viv?
Think about it.

376
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:22,106
She got that lighter skin, that's right.

377
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,069
Yo, Maya needs justice, man.

378
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:27,450
She needs to, like,
put her racist ass friend in check.

379
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,247
She's not really
that racist, she's like...

380
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,335
a good person.

381
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,089
No, that shit that she said to you

382
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,259
was some of the most fucked up stuff
that I've ever heard.

383
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,349
I bet my sister doesn't even know
what racism is.

384
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:42,146
That is such bullshit. Yes, I do.

385
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,486
It's like when you're mean to people

386
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:48,785
'cause of their skin color
and like lynch them.

387
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:50,998
No, it's not always as obvious as that.

388
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,588
Yeah, Maya, think about it.

389
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:57,176
<i>Use your head.</i>

390
00:20:58,178 --> 00:21:00,474
<i>- Do your parents own the cleaners?
- You look dirty.</i>

391
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,728
<i>When did you immigrate here?</i>

392
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:03,147
<i>I've never met
an oriental before.</i>

393
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,359
- <i>Say something in Chinese.
- Konnichiwa.</i>

394
00:21:05,944 --> 00:21:09,492
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What the fuck, dude.

395
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,371
- Come on.
- What? It's disgu...

396
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:12,791
Ah!

397
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,920
Sorry, it happens sometimes.

398
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:16,381
You see now.

399
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,762
You got to speak up for yourself.

400
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,181
Yeah.

401
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:22,644
You got to beat up your friend.

402
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,527
Yeah.

403
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:32,330
Hey, let me hit that.

404
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:33,583
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

405
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,543
Hey, no...

406
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,760
- Don't... Maya!
- Fucking... Jesus.

407
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:42,391
Let's do it.

408
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,546
I have to beat you up.

409
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:20,927
I'm gonna eat you up.

410
00:22:21,888 --> 00:22:23,725
I'm gonna beat your ass now.

411
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:25,729
I'm gonna eat your ass.

412
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:28,818
Hello, 'Na.

413
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:35,624
May.

414
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,003
Hey, 'Na.

415
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:39,882
I...

416
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:42,428
- Do it.
- I, uh...

417
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:48,315
- I have to beat your white ass up...
- White ass up.

418
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:50,319
...now.

419
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:54,954
Follow me, bitch.

420
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,630
OK.

421
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:02,928
Oh, yeah, you got this, Maya.

422
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:04,347
Yeah, come on.

423
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,978
They want you to really punch me, so...

424
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,480
Stand up for yourself.

425
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:09,942
Go!

426
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:13,282
Come on! Get angry.

427
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,535
Hit her.

428
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:22,968
Yeah.

429
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,811
- Go!
- I can't believe you fucking did that!

430
00:23:27,894 --> 00:23:29,188
I was trying to help.

431
00:23:29,314 --> 00:23:31,318
By telling everyone I'm Asian.

432
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,365
They already freaking know. Am I right?

433
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:37,163
I know, I mean, duh,
like I know I'm Asian,

434
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:39,375
- but I'm more than that.
- I know and that's what I was trying to

435
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:40,795
- say, like...
- Yeah.

436
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,924
You just shouldn't hide it
and I just thought that I was...

437
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,887
celebrating your heritage.

438
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:48,811
That is so easy for you to say.
You don't know what it's like to be me.

439
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:51,817
You're right. I don't. You're right.

440
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:55,992
OK, and I wanna choose
which Spice Girl I'm gonna be.

441
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:58,163
I know, you... you should.

442
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:01,044
And I should've told them
that you are Posh Spice.

443
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,298
- I should've, OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

444
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,052
And Guido's fucked up.

445
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,431
I don't wanna punch you.

446
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:10,814
I don't want you to punch me either.

447
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:14,195
Please.

448
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:17,536
Yeah, you punch that racist.

449
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:19,372
Hit her.

450
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,516
- Five...
- Six...

451
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:31,689
- Seven...
- Eight...

452
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:37,116
What the hell is this?

453
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:59,160
- Boo!
- Boo!

454
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:00,997
It's not fighting.
You guys are hugging.

455
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:03,251
Let's get out of here.

456
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:16,110
They don't even know how to do it.

457
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:18,950
Like, I feel like
I was going so much harder...

458
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:22,039
- That guy...
- He got so freaked out.

459
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,630
Are you sure, like,
that I didn't hurt you at all?

460
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:28,134
I was, like, rough

461
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:29,638
and tumble.

462
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:31,892
It's crazy. Ma... Ow!

463
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,521
You know that scares me.

464
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:35,274
Hey, Shuji.

465
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:36,944
What's up?

466
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:39,323
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

467
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:44,543
And I know that you probably hate me now
and I understand why.

468
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,672
I knew she wasn't gonna hit you, so...

469
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,425
That's a lie.

470
00:25:49,302 --> 00:25:52,308
- I was so freaking... I was like...
- Maya.

471
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:54,312
I was like...

472
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:00,825
Dude, your Japanese is so bad.

473
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,453
No, it isn't.

474
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:05,000
- That's so mean.
- I have no idea what you guys are saying

475
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,629
but I just literally love you.

476
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,828
