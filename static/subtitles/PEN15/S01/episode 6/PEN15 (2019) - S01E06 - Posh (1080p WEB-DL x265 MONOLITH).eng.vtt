WEBVTT

00:08.766 --> 00:09.768
OK.

00:10.101 --> 00:12.356
- They're gonna be here like any minute.
- I know.

00:12.607 --> 00:14.193
Did you bring your mom's shopping bag?

00:14.569 --> 00:17.742
- Oh, yes. Chanel, baby...
- Oh, perfect.

00:17.909 --> 00:20.790
- You want tape, too?
- Yeah, thanks.

00:21.123 --> 00:22.710
Thank you, madam.

00:23.127 --> 00:24.631
OK, so, we have...

00:25.090 --> 00:27.971
- the milk cups...
- OK, yeah, amazing.

00:28.681 --> 00:31.603
- Um, what else do we need?
- OK, we have some clothes.

00:31.687 --> 00:32.897
Stevie's gonna be bringing...

00:33.189 --> 00:34.316
- camera...
- Camera.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.447
Connie can bring clothes
and I have clothes.

00:37.532 --> 00:39.451
I just hope that they take
this project seriously

00:39.536 --> 00:41.540
'cause osteoporosis is not a joke.

00:41.623 --> 00:44.629
Like my grandmother had it
and devastated my father.

00:44.963 --> 00:46.299
He hasn't really been the same.

00:47.217 --> 00:48.386
Hey, Butt Lords.

00:49.013 --> 00:51.100
- What are you doing?
- Shuji, go away.

00:51.183 --> 00:53.731
We're working on,
like, a serious project. Hello!

00:53.814 --> 00:54.816
Hey, Shuj.

00:55.275 --> 00:56.319
What up?

00:56.695 --> 00:58.072
Hey, Evan.

00:58.949 --> 01:00.953
- Hey.
- What's up with you?

01:01.412 --> 01:03.458
We... we was gonna go see <i>Cast Away</i> again?

01:04.001 --> 01:05.211
I like your hair today.

01:05.295 --> 01:08.636
Um, my mum wanted me to give this to you
before we left. Um...

01:09.219 --> 01:11.600
Don't flick me off!

01:12.017 --> 01:13.646
Bye, Evan.

01:14.146 --> 01:16.818
- OK, do you, um...
- Your brother is fine.

01:16.902 --> 01:19.783
Anna, stop, that's disgusting.

01:19.866 --> 01:22.622
Uh, stop! OK, did you bring the snacks?

01:22.872 --> 01:23.916
Hell yeah!

01:25.043 --> 01:27.005
- Gushers, cheetos.
- Perfect.

01:27.172 --> 01:28.634
Just like you requested.

01:29.678 --> 01:31.430
- Oh, my God! OK, they're here.
- They're here.

01:31.515 --> 01:32.517
- They're here. We're good.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.228
- We're good. We're good.
- Yeah, we're good.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.192
- You look good. Do I? Mm-hmm.
- You look good. Yeah. Do I? OK.

01:37.484 --> 01:40.115
- Um... Chill.
- Shh. Chill.

01:44.039 --> 01:47.045
- Are you ready. One, two, three.
- You ready?

01:47.964 --> 01:48.841
Do it.

01:50.385 --> 01:52.180
One, two, three.

01:52.890 --> 01:53.767
Hey.

02:15.811 --> 02:17.648
Thanks for, like coming over, you guys.

02:18.065 --> 02:20.403
We had to for school, obviously.

02:20.613 --> 02:23.034
- Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.
- Yeah, obviously.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.579
So...

02:25.706 --> 02:27.502
Is anyone hungry?

02:38.982 --> 02:41.320
- You guys hungry, or like...
- Um...

02:42.405 --> 02:43.241
Anna?

02:44.076 --> 02:44.953
Like...

02:45.955 --> 02:46.873
No, don't... No.

02:51.090 --> 02:53.344
- Do you, like, have more food?
- No.

02:53.804 --> 02:56.058
That's not possible.
Uh, can I check the fridge?

02:56.141 --> 02:58.897
Actually my brother
ate everything we have,

02:58.981 --> 03:01.820
so, like there's nothing in there.
Literal... There's...

03:01.903 --> 03:03.197
It's just on the right.

03:03.866 --> 03:05.285
Ew!

03:05.368 --> 03:07.832
Why is there fish heads in here.
Close it! Close it.

03:12.675 --> 03:14.428
Maya, have you any ham?

03:19.772 --> 03:22.319
No, do you want me to buy some?

03:22.402 --> 03:23.780
No, it's like...
it's like an inside joke.

03:23.864 --> 03:26.118
- Yeah, OK.
- Never mind, I'm not hungry anymore.

03:27.162 --> 03:28.915
Should we, like, start the project

03:28.999 --> 03:31.755
- or... We'll start. OK. Get the clothes.
- Yeah, we'll do it, you guys, so...

03:32.255 --> 03:33.550
Um, if you want to choose, like,

03:33.634 --> 03:36.096
- Spice Girl outfits to be Spice Girls.
- Oh, yeah.

03:36.180 --> 03:38.476
Let's just pick
from what Connie and I brought.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.396
- Yeah.
- Oh, good idea.

03:40.480 --> 03:44.279
So, just to go over it, you guys,
so, we're the old Spice Girls

03:44.363 --> 03:47.828
and we, like, can't sing or dance
'cause we have osteoporosis

03:47.912 --> 03:51.126
so, we need milk, so, that we...
And then we drink and we get strong

03:51.168 --> 03:52.295
and then we'd fight dance...

03:52.379 --> 03:54.007
OK. I'm Baby.

03:54.341 --> 03:56.428
- I'm Posh.
- I want to be Posh.

03:56.805 --> 03:57.932
- Baby.
- Ginger.

03:58.015 --> 03:59.309
- I'm Sporty then.
- OK.

03:59.686 --> 04:01.731
OK. I'm Baby. Steve's Ginger,

04:02.440 --> 04:04.403
Anna's Sporty, and Connie's Posh.

04:04.486 --> 04:05.781
Wait, I called Posh.

04:05.864 --> 04:08.202
<i>My name is Posh and I go to Chanel.</i>

04:08.620 --> 04:11.083
- But you look the most like Scary.
- She does.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.047
Do you have,
like a Sporty outfit, or...

04:14.423 --> 04:16.427
This I guess could be Sporty's.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.099
- No, I do.
- Stevie, look.

04:19.182 --> 04:20.017
- Look...
- No.

04:21.521 --> 04:23.274
Guys, did you see that? Guys, guys,

04:23.357 --> 04:25.654
- you all... OK.
- That literally touched my face.

04:25.738 --> 04:27.616
- Touched my face.
- Guys, stop.

04:27.783 --> 04:28.702
We're about to record.

04:28.785 --> 04:32.333
So, we have the definition in the dance
but who's gonna bring us milk.

04:32.501 --> 04:34.046
- Not it.
- Not it.

04:34.129 --> 04:36.926
- Maya's it.
- I said "Not it" before all of you.

04:37.302 --> 04:38.137
I'll do it.

04:38.220 --> 04:39.766
No it's funny if Maya plays

04:39.849 --> 04:40.976
- the servant and brings us milk.
- Yeah.

04:41.310 --> 04:43.189
Wait, why do I have to be the servant?

04:43.439 --> 04:44.942
Because you're like different from us.

04:45.026 --> 04:46.613
Like, so, were the Spice girls,
and you are the servant

04:46.696 --> 04:47.531
'cause you're like tan.

04:49.117 --> 04:50.328
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:51.288 --> 04:52.750
So, okay that's funny.

04:54.504 --> 04:56.549
- No, like, hunch over more.
- Yeah, like, you're old.

04:56.633 --> 04:57.551
Like bent.

04:58.427 --> 05:00.933
- You got to go lower. Hunch over.
- Like lower.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.814
- Like this is not funny.
- Yeah.

05:04.272 --> 05:06.235
Who wants some milk?

05:06.611 --> 05:09.157
Guido! Guido, bring me some milk!

05:09.449 --> 05:10.911
Who's Guido? What's Guido.

05:11.036 --> 05:13.959
Maya's Guido The Gardener
because he's Mexican and she's tan.

05:15.796 --> 05:18.134
Tan!

05:20.054 --> 05:22.225
<i>Guido, do you want the milk?</i>

05:22.267 --> 05:26.066
- <i>Get it, get it? Me want milk...</i>
- Ew! Don't touch us.

05:26.150 --> 05:27.026
You're dirty.

05:27.611 --> 05:29.114
Guys, lets start.

05:29.657 --> 05:31.368
- OK, yeah.
- OK, get in line.

05:31.995 --> 05:33.289
I know. Sorry.

05:33.748 --> 05:35.459
- Sorry.
- OK.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.548
What are you doing? No, you're recording.

05:37.798 --> 05:39.009
Yeah. Guido!

05:39.092 --> 05:40.011
- No, I'm...
- You're on camera duty.

05:40.094 --> 05:42.182
- Yeah.
- I can record. I'll record.

05:42.265 --> 05:44.269
- No, no. Let her do it.
- OK.

05:44.562 --> 05:45.438
Get back...

05:45.522 --> 05:47.233
- I can do it.
- It's... Just push the button.

05:47.275 --> 05:48.820
- I know what button it is...
- She knows.

05:48.904 --> 05:49.822
...you guys.

05:56.753 --> 05:59.926
We're the old Spice Girls
and we have osteoporosis.

06:00.009 --> 06:03.474
A condition where,
um, your bones almost crack

06:03.558 --> 06:06.313
because you didn't get your vitamins.
Got milk?

06:08.693 --> 06:11.114
Ooh, I'm so old.

06:12.743 --> 06:14.705
Ooh, my back.

06:18.755 --> 06:19.966
Oh, thank you.

06:35.747 --> 06:38.460
- Five, six, seven, eight. One...
- Five, six, seven, eight.

06:43.972 --> 06:45.600
And then it's kind of doing this
at the end.

06:45.684 --> 06:46.602
Yeah, like this. Yeah.

06:47.604 --> 06:49.775
But it was like,
sometimes it looked like this,

06:49.859 --> 06:51.654
but it was...

06:52.030 --> 06:53.198
it was so fun.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.453
And we filmed it, on... And it was like,

06:55.537 --> 06:58.042
- Stevie, Jessica, Connie. Yeah.
- Oh, my God,

06:58.125 --> 06:59.335
actually Maya did this

06:59.503 --> 07:01.465
- really funny character...
- No.

07:01.549 --> 07:02.718
- ...for that...
- I'm not doing it.

07:02.968 --> 07:05.139
It was so funny.

07:05.222 --> 07:06.224
I'd want to see it.

07:06.308 --> 07:07.770
OK. I'll do it.

07:07.853 --> 07:10.692
- OK. It's really funny, but it was like...
- So funny.

07:11.193 --> 07:12.361
- It's like...
- They made me do it,

07:12.487 --> 07:15.284
and I, like, didn't know what I was...
uh, I'll do it. OK. Like...

07:16.662 --> 07:21.881
<i>Oh, Guido, you want
the milk for you... I make the cake.</i>

07:22.508 --> 07:24.094
Oh, my God.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.641
- It's like...
- OK, you racist.

07:26.933 --> 07:30.481
- It's not racist.
- They were, like, joking. I don't know.

07:30.565 --> 07:32.694
Wait, did... did you
just make fun of Mexicans?

07:32.986 --> 07:35.032
I wasn't... I didn't say I was Mexican,

07:35.116 --> 07:36.243
like, they told me I was

07:36.326 --> 07:38.706
- and it was like a joke.
- So, wait, wait, wait. So...

07:39.290 --> 07:40.459
In this video project,

07:40.794 --> 07:42.088
you play servant

07:42.673 --> 07:44.259
and you're serving all your white friends?

07:44.635 --> 07:45.971
Hmm-hmm.

07:46.889 --> 07:48.852
And she put a blanket
over Ojichan's shrine.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.275
You don't mess with Ojichan's shrine.

07:52.358 --> 07:53.193
I didn't.

07:53.277 --> 07:54.738
- I just didn't want to scare them.
- Oh, my God.

07:54.822 --> 07:57.703
Why are you so ashamed of being Japanese?

07:57.786 --> 07:59.122
I'm not.

07:59.582 --> 08:03.297
I'm like barely Japanese,
and I'm cool with it.

08:04.299 --> 08:05.719
Guido is fucked up, too.

08:06.178 --> 08:07.346
<i>Watch your language.</i>

08:09.225 --> 08:10.854
Mom? What?

08:11.939 --> 08:13.902
Anna, you are more fucked up
for making her do that.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.029
Mom?

08:16.574 --> 08:18.118
Good job, racists.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.954
<i>...as a great beacon light of hope,</i>

09:22.121 --> 09:25.127
<i>the greatest demonstration for freedom</i>

09:25.210 --> 09:27.381
<i>in the history of our nation.</i>

09:28.801 --> 09:30.972
<i>It came as a joyous daybreak</i>

09:33.018 --> 09:36.609
<i>to end the long night of their captivity.</i>

09:42.244 --> 09:43.539
"Brings attention

09:44.290 --> 09:46.879
to reality that teenagers
are in denial about."

10:27.293 --> 10:28.462
<i>Oh, dude!</i>

10:28.963 --> 10:30.800
- I just caught a Psyduck!
- OK.

10:30.884 --> 10:32.136
You're such an idiot.

10:32.721 --> 10:35.184
- Let's see it.
- I got you. I got you so good.

10:35.267 --> 10:36.729
You do this every single time.

10:36.812 --> 10:38.398
Dude, it's like it's two time.

10:38.482 --> 10:40.360
It's not funny.

10:40.862 --> 10:43.325
I get you every time.
It's always funny.

10:47.667 --> 10:48.878
Can we help you?

10:49.671 --> 10:51.967
<i>No, can I help you?</i>

10:52.009 --> 10:54.055
Oh, we don't...
we don't speak Japanese.

10:54.932 --> 10:55.892
Me neither.

10:59.942 --> 11:03.073
No!
God, you're paying for that.

11:09.586 --> 11:13.009
Hi. Um, is the principal here, please.
It's important, please.

11:13.426 --> 11:15.347
The principal isn't in right now.

11:15.682 --> 11:17.059
Is there something I can help you.

11:17.561 --> 11:23.530
Um, yeah, actually
I... I've been noticing some, um...

11:23.614 --> 11:25.200
racism in society

11:25.577 --> 11:27.706
and I would like to report it.

11:30.252 --> 11:31.087
OK, kiddo.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.930
- Oh, Principal Ravage.
- Ah.

11:36.306 --> 11:38.226
Um, I just have a quick thought for you.

11:38.978 --> 11:41.609
- Um...
- Yeah, uh-huh. Sure. What?

11:41.650 --> 11:44.447
Um, I've been noticing
a bit of a pattern in this school

11:44.531 --> 11:45.490
- which is, um...
- Mm-hmm.

11:46.952 --> 11:48.539
Um, racism.

11:48.748 --> 11:51.503
And also separate se-segregation.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.593
And I just think it needs fixings, so...

11:54.635 --> 11:58.726
Uh-huh. Well, thank you
for bringing this to my attention,

11:59.352 --> 12:00.228
Anna,

12:00.312 --> 12:02.483
but I can't tell kids
who to spend time with.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.821
And I hear that. I really do, but...

12:05.030 --> 12:07.744
actually asked Jeeves last night
for some ideas.

12:08.078 --> 12:11.627
And I'm thinking of like a demonstration
or something, you know, like...

12:11.669 --> 12:13.756
they do organize drunk driving scenes

12:13.839 --> 12:16.010
to show kids,
like why not to drink and drive,

12:16.135 --> 12:17.639
and I think we can do like the same thing.

12:17.722 --> 12:20.102
Uh, you know what? I hear you,

12:20.812 --> 12:23.149
but these tend to work themselves out.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.487
Sometimes they don't
and you need a demonstration.

12:26.865 --> 12:27.867
OK.

12:27.951 --> 12:29.453
Great.

12:29.746 --> 12:32.126
I guess it's up to me, you dick.

12:36.844 --> 12:37.804
Wake up!

12:39.599 --> 12:41.269
So, it'll just be kind of a favor,

12:41.603 --> 12:44.526
um, and it wouldn't interfere
with drama rehearsal after school at all.

12:44.901 --> 12:46.530
It actually be like...

12:47.364 --> 12:48.491
now-ish.

12:49.243 --> 12:50.120
Um...

12:51.707 --> 12:55.464
So, yeah? Just see,
you think of this as a script

12:56.090 --> 12:58.596
and if you're him...

13:00.307 --> 13:01.184
Hi.

13:01.392 --> 13:02.896
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:03.104 --> 13:04.816
Hi!
- Hey, darling.

13:05.150 --> 13:07.572
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm OK.

13:07.655 --> 13:09.534
I don't know, I'm just a little like...

13:09.910 --> 13:11.997
- blah, after last night.
- Yeah.

13:12.081 --> 13:14.376
I know what you mean, it was crazy.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.466
- Yeah, it was just weird.
- It's kind of eye-opening for me.

13:17.550 --> 13:19.930
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I'm sorry.

13:21.265 --> 13:22.936
And I got a little something
for you later.

13:23.061 --> 13:24.063
What do you have?

13:24.230 --> 13:25.942
- OK, party people...
- A surprise?

13:26.025 --> 13:29.533
...today we're talking
about the late Thomas Jefferson.

13:29.616 --> 13:31.745
What do we know about the great TJ? Yes.

13:32.789 --> 13:33.833
Yeah, he's dead.

13:35.753 --> 13:36.922
That is true. OK.

13:37.297 --> 13:38.634
Yes. Gabe again.

13:39.009 --> 13:40.930
Uh, he loves grilled bananas.

13:41.723 --> 13:42.976
I don't think that's true, Gabe.

13:44.270 --> 13:45.188
Bless you.

13:45.773 --> 13:46.942
You don't know what I know.

13:46.984 --> 13:49.739
OK, I do know
that he was a Founding Father.

13:50.407 --> 13:51.367
What...

13:51.785 --> 13:53.454
He was a disgusting slave owner.

14:01.555 --> 14:03.224
Maya is Japanese.

14:04.393 --> 14:06.063
That's so weird.

14:07.859 --> 14:10.948
Yeah, that is weird. I bet she eats...

14:12.660 --> 14:14.956
I bet she eats all kinds of gross foods.

14:15.165 --> 14:17.419
Fish-heads. Ew!

14:17.962 --> 14:19.006
No, I don't.

14:19.340 --> 14:23.222
And this, you guys has been
an example of racism.

14:23.389 --> 14:25.937
And I would just like everybody
to acknowledge that

14:26.020 --> 14:29.694
- and I see that happening in our school...
- I am Japanese.

14:29.778 --> 14:31.740
So, um, where was I?

14:32.115 --> 14:35.413
- I was just saying that in America...
- Maya, me love you long time!

14:35.497 --> 14:37.961
- You sound Jamaican...
- OK.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.673
That's not part of this.

14:39.756 --> 14:42.512
Hey, Lucy Liu,
can I get a $5 hand-job?

14:42.595 --> 14:45.433
You're Japanese?
No shit, Maya, I'm American.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.853
- Her eyes are always closed.
- Hey, hey,

14:46.979 --> 14:48.147
what's going on here?

14:48.857 --> 14:51.822
Everyone, everyone,
get back to your classes.

14:51.905 --> 14:53.282
What's going on?

14:54.201 --> 14:56.414
Someone put this on my locker.

15:00.798 --> 15:03.302
Who is responsible for this?

15:07.520 --> 15:09.481
Well, it's...

15:10.066 --> 15:11.152
Seriously?

15:12.446 --> 15:14.868
Oh, Miss Kone, come on, come on.

15:14.993 --> 15:17.330
We're going to wait in here
till Mr. Ravage comes.

15:17.414 --> 15:19.502
- Maya, it was...
- We're going to have to call your parents,

15:19.586 --> 15:20.921
you know, that was a hate crime.

15:21.047 --> 15:22.842
- It...
- Come on, come on, get in there.

15:22.925 --> 15:24.470
Be quiet and sit down.

15:27.685 --> 15:29.606
I thought they were friends.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.192
Anna.

15:32.027 --> 15:34.073
- Kone.
- Mom.

15:34.448 --> 15:36.035
She is my best friend

15:36.494 --> 15:37.705
and her name is Maya

15:37.997 --> 15:39.626
and just so you know

15:39.793 --> 15:42.422
the only reason I did that
was to bring attention because

15:42.590 --> 15:45.554
Becca and Stevie and Connie
were treating her differently.

15:45.846 --> 15:48.560
All right.
Let's not point the finger, all right?

15:48.811 --> 15:50.898
This is about you and all this racism.

15:51.107 --> 15:53.904
Honey, I taught you this, no?

15:54.697 --> 15:56.701
- I'm disappointed.
- That's what I'm trying to say.

15:56.785 --> 15:58.914
I'm trying to bring
attention to the issue.

15:58.997 --> 16:01.545
Don't be a know it all. You're 13.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.174
I... I think, uh, some...

16:04.676 --> 16:07.180
major apologizing is in order.

16:07.347 --> 16:09.476
See, this is why she doesn't take
anything seriously.

16:09.561 --> 16:11.063
- Why?
- You just want her to apologize

16:11.188 --> 16:12.567
go through the motions of apologizing

16:12.650 --> 16:14.571
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
and then you're gonna go home

16:14.696 --> 16:16.198
and you'll watch
<i>The Simpsons</i> with her later.

16:16.490 --> 16:18.996
- The point is, then she doesn't learn...
- What's wrong with <i>The Simpsons?</i>

16:19.079 --> 16:22.628
...to take it seriously.
Jesus fucking Christ, Curtis.

16:22.712 --> 16:25.091
- Mom, we're in school, you can't say...
- Who gives a fuck?

16:25.216 --> 16:28.264
OK, uh, I wanna thank you both...

16:28.849 --> 16:30.351
so much for coming down here today.

16:30.686 --> 16:34.401
And as for you, Miss Kone,
I will see you in detention.

16:38.869 --> 16:39.871
I'm not eating.

16:40.706 --> 16:42.960
I'm not eating until racism is over.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.467
You're going on a hunger strike
like Gandhi?

16:46.760 --> 16:49.933
- What?
- Oh, for heaven sakes.

17:01.247 --> 17:02.708
Geez, dummy.

17:04.921 --> 17:05.839
What happened?

17:10.306 --> 17:11.433
Nothing.

17:15.776 --> 17:17.905
Come on. Lets' go.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.297
Here you all go.

17:29.261 --> 17:30.263
You know what?

17:31.683 --> 17:34.647
Take a nice long look at yourself,

17:35.398 --> 17:36.610
and your bigotry.

17:43.414 --> 17:44.458
It's your problem.

17:44.876 --> 17:47.172
Anybody else, anybody else wanna test me?

17:47.548 --> 17:50.428
- Boom, bitch.
- Suck my pubes, bitch.

17:52.808 --> 17:54.186
- Yo, what up, Shuji?
- What's up?

17:54.394 --> 17:55.689
What's up, Shuj?

17:56.691 --> 17:59.572
Um, welcome to the park.

18:00.198 --> 18:01.868
Yo, this is my sister, Maya.

18:03.162 --> 18:04.081
Yo, what up, Maya?

18:04.498 --> 18:05.626
What's up, Evan?

18:05.709 --> 18:08.130
- Let's sit down.
- So...

18:09.007 --> 18:10.969
Some fucked up shit happened to her today.

18:12.138 --> 18:14.852
Someone wrote "I'm Japanese" on her locker

18:15.019 --> 18:16.815
and a bunch of kids
called her a dirty Jap.

18:16.898 --> 18:18.902
Yo, that's fucked up.

18:19.361 --> 18:21.323
This is Andy Kim. He's in my grade.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.325
What's up?

18:23.244 --> 18:24.789
Yo, you're trying to hit this, though?

18:24.872 --> 18:26.960
- This tree is hella tight, dawg.
- Yeah, let's do it.

18:43.367 --> 18:44.662
Yo, Maya, you wanna hit this?

18:51.049 --> 18:52.511
- Hey, yo!
- No, wait.

18:53.220 --> 18:54.640
I'm just kidding.

18:54.724 --> 18:57.980
- Hey, yo, she never hit a pipe though.
- Yes, I have.

18:58.063 --> 19:01.613
Like freaking dank faded all the time.

19:01.696 --> 19:02.531
Oh!

19:03.491 --> 19:06.288
Um, you know what?
On second thought I feel like...

19:06.998 --> 19:10.756
I normally would, but I just,
during school, like shouldn't.

19:10.839 --> 19:13.385
- You know?
- Staying sober for school.

19:13.929 --> 19:14.806
I respect that.

19:15.641 --> 19:18.270
Uh, Shuji, you wanna hit this?
- Yeah. All right.

19:21.778 --> 19:25.243
Oh, God. Hey, Koney.
Why aren't you at lunch?

19:26.119 --> 19:27.330
Honey-baked ham day.

19:27.998 --> 19:30.419
I'm just kind of busy,
like fixing the school.

19:32.716 --> 19:36.431
Oh, well, actually
that's not really a bad idea

19:36.558 --> 19:38.435
to take a look at yourself
especially when you

19:38.812 --> 19:40.858
think something's everybody else's fault.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.277
OK.

19:43.153 --> 19:45.241
Have you seen Maya?
She's, like, mad at me or whatever.

19:45.868 --> 19:48.122
Uh, sweetie pie, why don't you sit down
and have some lunch.

19:48.205 --> 19:49.876
You don't seem like yourself today.

19:50.418 --> 19:52.840
I'm on a hunger strike
until racism is over.

19:53.257 --> 19:56.598
Oh. Uh, you... you want half of this?

19:56.723 --> 19:58.727
Because that other thing's

19:58.810 --> 19:59.729
gonna take a sec.

20:01.398 --> 20:02.358
What kind is it?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.906
It's... It's kind of a meat.

20:06.618 --> 20:09.582
Ham. There might be cheese in it.

20:09.957 --> 20:12.086
- Just keep it. Just keep it.
- No, no. It's OK. I'm good.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.090
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

20:14.842 --> 20:16.428
- Yeah, right.
- Thanks, Jan.

20:17.598 --> 20:19.894
Why'd they switch out Aunt Viv?
Think about it.

20:20.061 --> 20:22.106
She got that lighter skin, that's right.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.069
Yo, Maya needs justice, man.

20:24.528 --> 20:27.450
She needs to, like,
put her racist ass friend in check.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.247
She's not really
that racist, she's like...

20:31.291 --> 20:32.335
a good person.

20:32.460 --> 20:34.089
No, that shit that she said to you

20:34.130 --> 20:36.259
was some of the most fucked up stuff
that I've ever heard.

20:37.220 --> 20:39.349
I bet my sister doesn't even know
what racism is.

20:39.474 --> 20:42.146
That is such bullshit. Yes, I do.

20:43.190 --> 20:45.486
It's like when you're mean to people

20:45.946 --> 20:48.785
'cause of their skin color
and like lynch them.

20:48.868 --> 20:50.998
No, it's not always as obvious as that.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.588
Yeah, Maya, think about it.

20:56.049 --> 20:57.176
<i>Use your head.</i>

20:58.178 --> 21:00.474
<i>- Do your parents own the cleaners?
- You look dirty.</i>

21:00.600 --> 21:01.728
<i>When did you immigrate here?</i>

21:01.811 --> 21:03.147
<i>I've never met
an oriental before.</i>

21:03.230 --> 21:05.359
- <i>Say something in Chinese.
- Konnichiwa.</i>

21:05.944 --> 21:09.492
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What the fuck, dude.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.371
- Come on.
- What? It's disgu...

21:11.789 --> 21:12.791
Ah!

21:12.875 --> 21:14.920
Sorry, it happens sometimes.

21:15.505 --> 21:16.381
You see now.

21:17.509 --> 21:18.762
You got to speak up for yourself.

21:19.345 --> 21:20.181
Yeah.

21:21.266 --> 21:22.644
You got to beat up your friend.

21:25.650 --> 21:26.527
Yeah.

21:31.161 --> 21:32.330
Hey, let me hit that.

21:32.623 --> 21:33.583
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:33.708 --> 21:34.543
Hey, no...

21:36.463 --> 21:38.760
- Don't... Maya!
- Fucking... Jesus.

21:41.431 --> 21:42.391
Let's do it.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.546
I have to beat you up.

22:19.257 --> 22:20.927
I'm gonna eat you up.

22:21.888 --> 22:23.725
I'm gonna beat your ass now.

22:24.058 --> 22:25.729
I'm gonna eat your ass.

22:26.731 --> 22:28.818
Hello, 'Na.

22:34.747 --> 22:35.624
May.

22:36.876 --> 22:38.003
Hey, 'Na.

22:38.963 --> 22:39.882
I...

22:41.343 --> 22:42.428
- Do it.
- I, uh...

22:45.017 --> 22:48.315
- I have to beat your white ass up...
- White ass up.

22:49.442 --> 22:50.319
...now.

22:53.408 --> 22:54.954
Follow me, bitch.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.630
OK.

23:01.383 --> 23:02.928
Oh, yeah, you got this, Maya.

23:03.345 --> 23:04.347
Yeah, come on.

23:05.140 --> 23:06.978
They want you to really punch me, so...

23:07.186 --> 23:08.480
Stand up for yourself.

23:09.023 --> 23:09.942
Go!

23:11.988 --> 23:13.282
Come on! Get angry.

23:13.700 --> 23:14.535
Hit her.

23:22.133 --> 23:22.968
Yeah.

23:25.180 --> 23:27.811
- Go!
- I can't believe you fucking did that!

23:27.894 --> 23:29.188
I was trying to help.

23:29.314 --> 23:31.318
By telling everyone I'm Asian.

23:31.610 --> 23:34.365
They already freaking know. Am I right?

23:34.992 --> 23:37.163
I know, I mean, duh,
like I know I'm Asian,

23:37.288 --> 23:39.375
- but I'm more than that.
- I know and that's what I was trying to

23:39.877 --> 23:40.795
- say, like...
- Yeah.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.924
You just shouldn't hide it
and I just thought that I was...

23:43.300 --> 23:44.887
celebrating your heritage.

23:45.513 --> 23:48.811
That is so easy for you to say.
You don't know what it's like to be me.

23:50.064 --> 23:51.817
You're right. I don't. You're right.

23:51.901 --> 23:55.992
OK, and I wanna choose
which Spice Girl I'm gonna be.

23:56.409 --> 23:58.163
I know, you... you should.

23:58.205 --> 24:01.044
And I should've told them
that you are Posh Spice.

24:01.169 --> 24:03.298
- I should've, OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:03.340 --> 24:05.052
And Guido's fucked up.

24:05.929 --> 24:07.431
I don't wanna punch you.

24:08.893 --> 24:10.814
I don't want you to punch me either.

24:13.193 --> 24:14.195
Please.

24:16.074 --> 24:17.536
Yeah, you punch that racist.

24:18.495 --> 24:19.372
Hit her.

24:26.762 --> 24:28.516
- Five...
- Six...

24:28.933 --> 24:31.689
- Seven...
- Eight...

24:36.072 --> 24:37.116
What the hell is this?

24:55.444 --> 24:59.160
- Boo!
- Boo!

24:59.243 --> 25:00.997
It's not fighting.
You guys are hugging.

25:02.249 --> 25:03.251
Let's get out of here.

25:13.773 --> 25:16.110
They don't even know how to do it.

25:16.236 --> 25:18.950
Like, I feel like
I was going so much harder...

25:20.035 --> 25:22.039
- That guy...
- He got so freaked out.

25:23.041 --> 25:25.630
Are you sure, like,
that I didn't hurt you at all?

25:26.005 --> 25:28.134
I was, like, rough

25:28.761 --> 25:29.638
and tumble.

25:30.055 --> 25:31.892
It's crazy. Ma... Ow!

25:31.976 --> 25:33.521
You know that scares me.

25:34.397 --> 25:35.274
Hey, Shuji.

25:36.067 --> 25:36.944
What's up?

25:37.529 --> 25:39.323
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

25:40.618 --> 25:44.543
And I know that you probably hate me now
and I understand why.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.672
I knew she wasn't gonna hit you, so...

25:47.089 --> 25:48.425
That's a lie.

25:49.302 --> 25:52.308
- I was so freaking... I was like...
- Maya.

25:53.435 --> 25:54.312
I was like...

25:59.488 --> 26:00.825
Dude, your Japanese is so bad.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.453
No, it isn't.

26:02.579 --> 26:05.000
- That's so mean.
- I have no idea what you guys are saying

26:05.083 --> 26:06.629
but I just literally love you.

26:40.530 --> 26:43.828
