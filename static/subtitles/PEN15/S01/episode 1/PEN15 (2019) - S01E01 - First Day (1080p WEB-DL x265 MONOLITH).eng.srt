1
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:13,182
<i>Oh, my God, Na, seventh grade!</i>

2
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:14,226
I know.

3
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:16,355
It's gonna be amazing.

4
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:24,872
<i>Who else is in homeroom with us?</i>

5
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:27,001
- Like a Sam?
- Oh, my God, he wishes.

6
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:30,341
He wants you so bad, it's crazy.

7
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:33,890
Ew, Na! Never in a trillion years,
it's disgusting.

8
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:36,270
- Like hell no!
- <i>No. I know.</i>

9
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,607
Do you think Alex is still dating Heather?

10
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:41,405
No, absolutely not.
I heard that they broke up,

11
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:44,829
<i>because Heather gave a handjob to both
Brandt J. and Dustin L. this summer.</i>

12
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:45,998
<i>Wait, what?</i>

13
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:47,793
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- That whole bag?

14
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:49,379
<i>Such a slut. Oh, my God, also,</i>

15
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:52,845
I heard that Connie M. grew
double D's her last night at camp.

16
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,222
<i>That's so effed up.</i>

17
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,767
How is that even possible?

18
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:58,564
<i>I don't know. It, like,
happened in the middle of her sleep.</i>

19
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:00,401
That's so unfair that
that happens to people...

20
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:01,653
- <i>I know.</i>
- ...I wish that was me.

21
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,492
- Na?
- <i>Huh?</i>

22
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:08,125
I'm gonna ask you something,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

23
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,254
<i>- Swear on your life.</i>
- Swear.

24
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:14,679
Do I look exactly the same as last year?

25
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:16,099
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- I won't be mad. Tell me.

26
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:17,518
- Oh, my God, not at all.
- <i>I won't be mad.</i>

27
00:01:17,602 --> 00:01:19,272
- <i>Are you kidding me?</i>
- Really?

28
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:20,483
<i>Promise.</i>

29
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:21,861
What are you going to wear tomorrow?

30
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:24,825
I'm thinking, like, my blue shirt with,
uh, the stripes.

31
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,119
<i>Oh, my God! So cute.</i>

32
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:28,457
But, like, I'm also thinking
of wearing a bra.

33
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,461
Oh, my God. That's, like, really smart.

34
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:31,798
You need it for your nipples.

35
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:34,511
Yeah.

36
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,889
I feel like we should make a pact.

37
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:39,229
Duh! Let's like...
Let's, like, do everything together.

38
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:42,402
Yeah, no doubt, like, all our
first together like our first kiss.

39
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:44,280
- Obviously.
- Yeah, no doubt.

40
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:45,826
Deal.

41
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:51,211
Oh, my God!
Seventh grade is gonna be so amazing.

42
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:52,881
It's gonna be really, really good.

43
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:55,469
This is gonna be like the best year
of our lives.

44
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,561
Shuji, get off AOL!

45
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:02,608
<i>Shuji!</i>

46
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:03,987
Maya?

47
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,289
What's up!

48
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:54,462
Yeah.

49
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:57,928
I guess I did change
a lot over the summer.

50
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,809
Like, broke up with my camp boyfriend.

51
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,605
Just like single now, so...

52
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:07,113
Yeah. Line up.

53
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:15,337
Do you like it? I changed it last night.

54
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:17,216
No, it's stupid.

55
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:20,139
No, it's not. It got layers.

56
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,451
Mom!

57
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:26,568
- What?
- I'll fix it.

58
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:27,695
Let me try fixing it.

59
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,657
OK, fine. Just like a couple of layers.

60
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,913
- OK, sit.
- Just on the left side, though, OK?

61
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:33,958
- Just like a little bit.
- OK. OK. OK.

62
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:35,461
It's not a lot.

63
00:03:35,544 --> 00:03:37,256
On the left side...

64
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,427
What are you doing with that bowl?

65
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,429
What now?

66
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,099
- I'm going to make it better.
- No, no, no.

67
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:43,227
- I'm going to make it better.
- Mom!

68
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,105
- I'm going to make it better.
- I'm not six anymore.

69
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:46,316
Don't put it.

70
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:50,241
OK, but...

71
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:54,332
OK, but not really short. OK?
Not like you've done before.

72
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:56,628
- Like a layer, OK?
- Like a layer?

73
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:59,300
OK, with not, like, a bowl.

74
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:01,054
What the fuck did you do?

75
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:03,392
Shut up, Shuji!

76
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,293
- Hi, Maya.
- Hi.

77
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:19,048
You ready for your first day
in a new school, sweetie?

78
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,469
- Yes, thanks.
- First year, Mom.

79
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:26,814
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

80
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:29,193
- How did you not tell me? You hair.
- I hate it. I hate it.

81
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:30,989
- Why? It looks so good.
- No, it doesn't.

82
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:32,951
- Are you serious?
- Does it? You swear?

83
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:33,995
Swear.

84
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:37,209
- Swear on my life?
- Swear on your freaking life.

85
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:40,967
OK, I was going for Sarah Michelle Geller,
but then, like, I ended up with this.

86
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:43,138
That's who I was gonna say.

87
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,392
But short?
- Yeah, how do I look, though?

88
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:46,979
- You look so good.
- No, I don't.

89
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:48,440
Yes, you do, like, so good.

90
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,652
This is just like... doesn't fit me right.

91
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,573
No. It looks amazing.

92
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,126
Oh, my God! You got spit on.

93
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,587
Move your bag, dummy.

94
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,924
Don't call me that.

95
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,095
Maya, move your bag.

96
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:07,103
- Are we picking up Sam next?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:17,206
- Hi, Mrs. Kone.
- Hello!

98
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,922
Hi, guys.

99
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:24,805
Maya, what the fuck did you do
to your hair?

100
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:28,103
- Na, you said it looked good.
- It does look good. I don't know why...

101
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:29,773
It looks like shit, Maya.

102
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:31,651
Suck my balls, Sam.

103
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:32,946
Suck these balls.

104
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:34,908
- Ew!
- That's nasty, Sam.

105
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,954
God!

106
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:39,333
Hey, Shuji.

107
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:43,718
Happy Eighth grade.

108
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,393
- Mom!
- Yeah, this is good.

109
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:51,942
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

110
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:53,486
- Maya, be cool.
- I am.

111
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,488
- Bye, Mom.
- Go.

112
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,159
Thank you, Kathy.

113
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:57,578
- Oh, my God. Maya? Maya?
- What? What?

114
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:59,917
We have to do it at the exact same time.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,254
- Oh, yeah.
- First steps in the middle school.

116
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:06,221
OK, ready? Wait.

117
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:09,811
One, two, three.

118
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:38,451
Watch out.

119
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:42,877
Oh, my God!

120
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:45,590
Connie M. is totally best friends
with Heather now.

121
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:46,927
Ooh. Oh, my God!

122
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:49,348
It's fricking true. They're ginormous!

123
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:15,108
- Jessica Abrams.
- Here.

124
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,114
- Anna Kone?
- Present.

125
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:21,037
- Uh, Brent Jackson?
- President!

126
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:24,418
OK. Cool guy.

127
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:28,093
- Uh, Maya Ishii-Peters.
- Present.

128
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:31,099
Ishii... Oishi... you making me hungry.

129
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:32,894
That means food, right?

130
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:36,275
Yeah. That's crazy. How do you know that?

131
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:39,115
Spent a little time in Japan
teaching English in my 20s...

132
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:43,623
- Right. Rebecca Roth?
- Here.

133
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,043
- Maya.
- What?

134
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:48,091
Um, is Alex looking at me?

135
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:51,264
- Robert Terry?
- Here.

136
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,435
- Julie Burger?
- No.

137
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:55,898
How about now? Hold on.

138
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:56,900
Present.

139
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,445
No.

140
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,159
No, he's hitting Brandt in the balls.

141
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,538
Hey. Don't. Get away from my balls.

142
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,752
- Brian Carter?
- Here.

143
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,839
- He'll probably look at me later.
- Yeah.

144
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,760
OK. Listen up, everyone.

145
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:11,471
I have your locker assignments.

146
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:14,143
So you can just... take it outside.

147
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,407
- Oh, my God!
- What are these?

148
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:22,576
What are what?

149
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,079
There's, like, all these signs.

150
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:26,292
"Brandt loves Maya."

151
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,588
"Dustin loves Maya."

152
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,091
It says down there, too.

153
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,887
Oh, my God! They all say

154
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,181
"Brandt loves Maya"
and "Dustin loves Maya."

155
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,558
Anna, what is happening?

156
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,105
Oh, my God!

157
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:39,693
I mean, is that like me?

158
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,572
- Yeah, it's you.
- Crazy. Wait. Wait. Wait.

159
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:44,286
They're literally the hottest guys
in the school.

160
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,290
Maya, it's happening.

161
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:48,044
Hey, Maya, come over here.

162
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,338
Yeah. Come over here.

163
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:50,925
Oh, my God!

164
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:53,848
- Come with me. Come with me.
- I can't.

165
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,058
- No, no, no. Come with me.
- They didn't say me.

166
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:56,143
- They only said you.
- OK, all right.

167
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:57,312
- OK.
- You got it.

168
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:04,953
What's up!

169
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:06,539
You look so different.

170
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:09,044
Thanks. Um...

171
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:12,969
Yeah. I got a...
I got a haircut last minute.

172
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,138
Oh, where did you get it?

173
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,100
Where did I get it?

174
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:21,987
- At the salon, that was, like, called...
- Superb.

175
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,489
Salon Superb.

176
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,201
Hmm. Never heard of that one.

177
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:26,454
Becca!

178
00:09:26,537 --> 00:09:28,207
But whatever you did, it worked.

179
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,255
Because Brandt and Dustin obviously think
you're, like, so fine this year.

180
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:33,176
No, they don't. You guys...

181
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:35,347
- They're totally into you.
- Everyone's talking about it.

182
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,641
- They were staring at you.
- Stop!

183
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:39,146
Yeah, Brandt's so fine,
and they both like you.

184
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:41,150
- Isn't that amazing?
- I know, like, what!

185
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,613
- Crazy!
- It's crazy, you guys,

186
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:46,327
like, I'm losing my mind right now.

187
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:55,303
They think I'm fine,
and Heather likes my haircut.

188
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,597
- Brandt loves you...
- Brandt loves Maya...

189
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,184
- Dustin loves Maya.
- Dustin loves you.

190
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,355
Wait. Wait a second. Wait.

191
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:02,944
Is there another Maya?

192
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:05,365
- No.
- No.

193
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:07,285
No. I can't... I can't think of anyone.

194
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:09,164
- Yeah. So it's me.
- It's you.

195
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:10,542
It's me. Oh, my God!

196
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,795
Oh, my God!

197
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,091
Hey! You two!

198
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:15,928
You think you can talk over me?

199
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,807
No.

200
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:20,395
Oh, thank you.

201
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,401
I've got my eye on you two.

202
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,908
Oh, my God!

203
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:33,546
- Come, come on.
- Get him, get him.

204
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:37,054
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry,
but, like, here comes Brandt.

205
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,514
God, no!

206
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:41,645
OK, just throw it.

207
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,155
Stop! Stop. Stop!

208
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,855
But then again, there's Dustin. He's fly.

209
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:09,409
His earring is so hot.

210
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:11,873
- Yeah, I know.
- He is so cute.

211
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:19,138
And then there's... him.

212
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:39,721
Earth to Blondie! Batter up!

213
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:41,725
- Sorry.
- Anna, that's you. Oh, my God, go.

214
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,108
Go, Na!

215
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,321
You got this.

216
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:50,910
Kick it, Na!

217
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:52,537
Kick it. Kick it!

218
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,392
Man down. Everybody, sit down.

219
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:07,108
Hey, you! Take your victim to the nurse.

220
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,830
I'm really, really, really, really sorry.

221
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,168
It's chill.

222
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:20,009
Um, it's crazy, though,

223
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:23,099
because you don't even look bad
with blood on your face.

224
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,442
Um, do you know my friend Maya?

225
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:29,737
Nah.

226
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:34,579
Oh, my God, that... that's crazy.

227
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:36,041
That's her nickname for me.

228
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,502
Na.

229
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:40,550
Um, she's my best friend. She's amazing,

230
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:43,974
and actually two of your best friends
are, like, in love with her.

231
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:47,105
So it's like, how do you pick, you know,

232
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:49,944
'cause, like, I've only ever been in love
with one person.

233
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:58,252
Brandt's nice, but you know,
Dustin has an earring.

234
00:12:58,335 --> 00:12:59,839
Dustin's a bitch.

235
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:05,726
Dustin is a bitch?

236
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:10,485
Dustin is a bitch.

237
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:11,653
A bitch?

238
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:13,699
- That's what Alex said.
- Oh, my God.

239
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:15,704
Yeah, so I really think that you should
just go with Brandt.

240
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:17,792
I mean, obviously, whatever you wanna do.

241
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,544
But do you really wanna do with the bitch

242
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:20,839
that doesn't hang out with Alex?

243
00:13:21,423 --> 00:13:23,887
I don't know. Maybe being with a bitch
is the best thing for me.

244
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,600
Look, I like his earring. Shit.

245
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,564
Can't believe they're not friends.
They're not best friends?

246
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:31,527
Yeah, I mean, obviously, not anymore.

247
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,030
That is crazy.

248
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:36,078
OK. Well,
then I don't wanna be with him. I don't.

249
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:38,040
I only wanna be with someone
who's best friends with Alex,

250
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:40,336
'cause I wanna be in the same room
with you for our first fingers.

251
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,257
Like, I'm not gonna do without you.

252
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,302
Seriously, like, I'm gonna go with Brandt.

253
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:46,640
Quiet, please.
Settle down.

254
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:50,231
Young sir in the Care Bear sweatshirt.

255
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:51,275
Huh?

256
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:52,736
She's a girl.

257
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:54,281
Yeah, I'm a girl.

258
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:57,412
Care to share something you did
over the summer?

259
00:13:57,997 --> 00:13:59,624
Come up to the front.

260
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:08,944
Um...

261
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:12,525
I guess, like, the most memorable thing
I did over this summer

262
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:15,866
was I watched <i>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,</i>
like, six times in a row.

263
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:17,745
And it is, like, really funny.

264
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:22,670
'Cause he does, like, all this like,
rewind, like, fast forward stuff, like...

265
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,635
I'll just do it. It's like...

266
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:29,017
"I really wanna play, Coach.
Just give me a chance.

267
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:31,814
Let's see that in instant slow-mo."

268
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,192
Really makes me laugh.

269
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:56,739
And he does this other thing,
where he's like...

270
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:59,286
Ahhh!

271
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,178
Sit down.

272
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,272
Enough of that.

273
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:16,320
OK. Everyone,
take out your summer reading,

274
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:18,282
and get into groups of four.

275
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:22,040
Uh, John, Lydia, Jafeer...

276
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:25,629
OK, so, what do you think about this
if I give that to Brandt?

277
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,018
Um, it could go like this.

278
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:42,831
Look,
I feel like it needs a question.

279
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,209
OK. Yeah, I know. You're right.

280
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:46,588
And then put my name,
'cause he won't know who it is.

281
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:48,634
Perfect.

282
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:53,352
So exciting.

283
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,863
OK, Brandt.

284
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:06,086
I'm gonna, like, have my first boyfriend.

285
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:07,213
No doubt.

286
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:08,925
That's freaking crazy.

287
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,594
It's amazing, and we'll go on, like,
double dates and stuff.

288
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,848
I know, with, like, Alex.

289
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,142
I mean, if he wants to.

290
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,020
Dustin says yes. Dustin says yes.

291
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:16,189
- Brandt says yes.
- I do not say yes.

292
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:17,191
- Yes, he does.
- No, I do not.

293
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,193
- Yes, he does.
- No, I do not.

294
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,822
Oh, my God, wait.

295
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:21,700
Dustin, that is, like,
so presumptuous to think

296
00:16:21,784 --> 00:16:23,245
that she's asking you. She asked him.

297
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:24,790
You guys, stop.

298
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:27,713
This is, like, so mean. Just tell her.

299
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:30,009
U-G-I-S, biyatch!

300
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:31,553
- UGIS.
- UGIS.

301
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:34,935
Wait, what?

302
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,731
Oh, honey, don't you know?

303
00:16:36,814 --> 00:16:38,735
It means ugliest girl in school.

304
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:45,206
UGIS!

305
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:46,959
They're so mean.

306
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:49,840
And they said they don't know
why you are wearing a bra, Anna,

307
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:52,261
'cause there's nothing to go in it.

308
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,809
I'm so sorry.

309
00:16:56,686 --> 00:16:59,735
It's cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, this is really funny.

310
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,116
UGIS! UGIS!

311
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:05,579
- Thanks for telling me, Becca.
- You're welcome.

312
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:07,375
- OK.
- Bye.

313
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,795
Bye.

314
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:20,735
It's not they like my haircut.

315
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,446
They're assholes.

316
00:17:22,697 --> 00:17:24,409
No. They were right.

317
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:29,544
- I am ugly. I'm a freaking freak.
- No, you're not.

318
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:32,258
Like...

319
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:33,845
I'm UGIS.

320
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:39,022
Maya, if UGIS means beautiful unicorn,

321
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:43,030
then yeah, you... you you're UGIS.
Then, yeah, you are.

322
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:45,534
No. Na, do you understand, like,

323
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:47,873
I'm the ugliest girl in school.

324
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:50,879
You get that in your skull?

325
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:53,718
Like, to love me is the biggest insult.

326
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:56,181
Like, that's what it means.

327
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:03,695
Then I guess, you know,
I've been insulted the greatest.

328
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:48,870
You literally look, like, hot right now.

329
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,878
You know, none of this
actually makes any sense.

330
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:53,963
I know.

331
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:56,092
Like Terra Newback?
It's a hunchback for Pete's sake.

332
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,763
Yeah, I know.
Or freaking Cindy Puchak like?

333
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,223
Her mole covers her whole neck.

334
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,352
It's the size of my face, like,
it's bigger.

335
00:19:01,436 --> 00:19:03,106
And like, think about Beth Mahoney.

336
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,737
Beth Mahoney is freaking busted like...

337
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,908
- She's UGIS.
- She's so UGIS.

338
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:09,577
- Like I'm UGIS?
- You're not UGIS.

339
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,083
- Hey, UGIS.
- Go fuck your mom.

340
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:14,420
They're all a bunch of fuckers.

341
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:19,472
We just have to do something about this.

342
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:20,725
Anna, I can't.

343
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:24,817
I have an idea.

344
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:27,906
Do you know where the eighth graders sit?

345
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,025
You shouldn't be here.

346
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,446
- Get out of here, freaks.
- OK.

347
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,657
- Fucking leave.
- We should go.

348
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:51,578
Shuji, no. It's important. Stop.

349
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:53,581
Um...

350
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,962
They were these boys in our grade,

351
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:58,508
who were not kind to...

352
00:19:58,592 --> 00:20:00,763
- I need you to beat them up, Shuji.
- Yeah.

353
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:02,726
Like, it just needs to happen.

354
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:04,145
Why should I?

355
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,234
See. Like I told you he wouldn't care.

356
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,697
This is literally, like,
the worst day of my life,

357
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:12,036
and he'll probably call me UGIS, too.

358
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,542
Did you just say UGIS?

359
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:17,296
Yeah.

360
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:25,145
UGIS is the worst thing you can be called.

361
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:28,235
The list of UGIS's past,
they're all heinous dogs.

362
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:29,320
There's a list?

363
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:32,493
Look, I'm not gonna beat up
a seventh grader,

364
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,038
but I can teach you some words.

365
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:36,376
Um, what do they look like?

366
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:39,590
Um. Well, like, um...

367
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:45,310
Brandt, he, like,
has this, like, chestnut silky hair,

368
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:47,564
and it's like, he has brown honeydew...

369
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,360
No, what are his bad features?

370
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,199
Oh.

371
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:53,410
Um...

372
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:57,084
- I think he's like... he's, like, short.
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,713
- That's true.
- Yeah. That's good.

374
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:00,173
- Is that good?
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:02,136
- And like, Stacy Davis told me that...
- Oh, yeah.

376
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,931
...she gave me a handy
when his dad was sick

377
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,350
to help make him feel better,

378
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,646
and she said he's not circumcised,

379
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:09,317
and it looks like an aardvark.

380
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,694
That's what she said.

381
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:12,741
OK, for sure, you're gonna wanna bring up
the aardvark dick.

382
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:14,995
- OK.
- OK, this is what you're gonna say.

383
00:21:15,078 --> 00:21:18,043
Hey, you porcupine midget piece of shit,

384
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:20,757
I would never touch that aardvark dick
with a 10-foot pole,

385
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,676
so suck it, bitch.

386
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:28,229
You got it?

387
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:31,277
Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:32,947
- That was great.
- OK. All right.

389
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:34,617
- OK.
- Don't...

390
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,912
Come on.

391
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,434
You guys. You guys!

392
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:51,275
After school,
I'm gonna bitch out Brandt and Dustin.

393
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:53,238
Magic.

394
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:56,912
She's gonna get her butt kicked.

395
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,510
- You can do this.
- Yeah.

396
00:22:04,677 --> 00:22:06,305
Like don't let anyone stop you
from your dreams.

397
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:07,641
Yeah.

398
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:25,385
- What's up?
- So what's up!

399
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,556
- What's up?
- What's up?

400
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:30,228
- You midget!
- What are you doing?

401
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:34,069
- Midget!
- OK.

402
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:35,990
Midget.

403
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:38,787
You midget. Aardvark. You got an aardvark?

404
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:41,459
- You got an aardvark.
- I... I have a dog.

405
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:43,379
Has a dog.

406
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,467
- You're a piece of shit!
- Yeah, you're a piece of shit!

407
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,012
Oh, damn, you're gonna take that?

408
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:48,807
Midget piece of shit.

409
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:50,227
Yeah, what?

410
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:53,483
Come on. Come on, fight.

411
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:55,738
Yeah! Yeah! You mi...

412
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:57,282
You midget piece of shit! Yeah!

413
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:58,576
You gonna take that?

414
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,080
- You better take that.
- Yeah, take that.

415
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:02,000
- You gonna take that?
- What?

416
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,796
- You're a midget piece of shit!
- Yeah!

417
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:07,386
And you got an aardvark dick,
and that's why your dad died.

418
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:13,398
- Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Go! Go!
- Yes!

419
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:21,247
Hey, Brandt, are you OK?

420
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:24,713
Can't believe you'd bring up his dad.

421
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,050
What the fuck? Come on.

422
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:29,305
You can't help it if Dustin's a bitch.

423
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:30,432
Fuck you!

424
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:32,102
Oh, my God, my mom!

425
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:34,231
- Go! Go!
- Maya...

426
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:36,235
It's OK.

427
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:44,168
Did I go too far today?

428
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:48,426
<i>I mean, like, it was definitely,
like, intense.</i>

429
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:51,432
I probably shouldn't have said that
about his dad.

430
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,436
<i>Yeah. I mean, it was crazy.</i>

431
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,484
<i>- But, like, his dad did die. It's just a fact.</i>
- Oh, wait, Na.

432
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,154
<i>Oh! Mayi?</i>

433
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,369
<i>Mayi? Hello?</i>

434
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:03,122
- Hold on.
<i>- OK.</i>

435
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:13,017
<i>What you doing?</i>

436
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,440
<i>I mean, Maya, are you there?</i>

437
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,033
- Oh, my God, Na!
<i>- Oh, my God, what?</i>

438
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:24,833
- Oh, my God!
<i>- What?</i>

439
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:30,093
Holy f-balls!

440
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,094
Can't do this.

441
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,104
I don't wanna face everyone.

442
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:42,780
I don't wanna do seventh grade.

443
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:45,618
I'm not doing seventh grade by myself.

444
00:25:45,703 --> 00:25:47,455
No, it's gonna be a lot easier
for you now.

445
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:49,209
I mean, like, you should go.

446
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:51,756
Maya.

447
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:55,973
You are my actual rainbow gel pen

448
00:25:57,017 --> 00:26:01,442
in a sea of blue and black
writing utensils, like...

449
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,279
- I'm not doing it alone.
- Really?

450
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:04,573
Yeah! Duh!

451
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:07,245
- So we'll do it together?
- Yeah.

452
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:09,666
Just one step at a time.
It's not like it's gonna last forever.

453
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:11,170
- Yeah, it's not.
- Like...

454
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:12,715
And, like, I'll do it you do it.

455
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:17,682
OK. I'll do it if you do it.

456
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,069
Wait.

457
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:27,953
We have to do it
at the exact same time, OK?

458
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:33,339
One, two...
