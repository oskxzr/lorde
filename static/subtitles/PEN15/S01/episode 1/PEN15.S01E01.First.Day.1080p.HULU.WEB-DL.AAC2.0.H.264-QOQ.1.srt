00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:15,155
It's gonna be amazing.

00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:25,801
- Like a Sam?
- Oh, my God, he wishes.

9
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:29,141
He wants you so bad, it's crazy.

10
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:32,690
Ew, Na! Never in a trillion years,
it's disgusting.

11
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:35,070
- Like hell no!
- <i>No. I know.</i>

12
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:37,407
Do you think Alex is still dating Heather?

13
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:40,205
No, absolutely not.
I heard that they broke up,

14
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:43,629
<i>because Heather gave a handjob to both
Brandt J. and Dustin L. this summer.</i>

15
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:44,798
<i>Wait, what?</i>

16
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,593
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- That whole bag?

17
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:48,179
<i>Such a slut. Oh, my God, also,</i>

18
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:51,645
I heard that Connie M. grew
double D's her last night at camp.

19
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:53,022
<i>That's so effed up.</i>

20
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:54,567
How is that even possible?

21
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:57,364
<i>I don't know. It, like,
happened in the middle of her sleep.</i>

22
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:59,260
That's so unfair that
that happens to people...

23
00:00:59,284 --> 00:01:00,604
- <i>I know.</i>
- I wish that was me.

24
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:03,292
- Na?
- <i>Huh?</i>

25
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:06,925
I'm gonna ask you something,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

26
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:09,054
<i>- Swear on your life.</i>
- Swear.

27
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:13,479
Do I look exactly the same as last year?

28
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:14,959
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- I won't be mad. Tell me.

29
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:16,378
- Oh, my God, not at all.
- <i>I won't be mad.</i>

30
00:01:16,402 --> 00:01:18,072
- <i>Are you kidding me?</i>
- Really?

31
00:01:18,156 --> 00:01:19,283
<i>Promise.</i>

32
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:20,721
What are you going to wear tomorrow?

33
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:23,625
I'm thinking, like, my blue shirt with,
uh, the stripes.

34
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,919
<i>Oh, my God! So cute.</i>

35
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,257
But, like, I'm also thinking
of wearing a bra.

36
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,261
Oh, my God. That's, like, really smart.

37
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,598
You need it for your nipples.

38
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,311
Yeah.

39
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,749
I feel like we should make a pact.

40
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:38,029
Duh! Let's like...
Let's, like, do everything together.

41
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:41,202
Yeah, no doubt, like, all our
first together like our first kiss.

42
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,080
- Obviously.
- Yeah, no doubt.

43
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:44,626
Deal.

44
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:50,011
Oh, my God!
Seventh grade is gonna be so amazing.

45
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:51,681
It's gonna be really, really good.

46
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:54,269
This is gonna be like the best year
of our lives.

47
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:58,361

Yeah.

58

I guess I did change
a lot over the summer.

59
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:59,609
Like, broke up with my camp boyfriend.

60
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:02,405
Just like single now, so...

61
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:05,913
Yeah. Line up.

62
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:14,137
Do you like it? I changed it last night.

63
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:16,016
No, it's stupid.

64
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:18,939
No, it's not. It got layers.

65
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,269
Mom!

66
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:25,368
- What?
- I'll fix it.

67
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:26,495
Let me try fixing it.

68
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,457
OK, fine. Just like a couple of layers.

69
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,713
- OK, sit.
- Just on the left side, though, OK?

70
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,758
- Just like a little bit.
- OK. OK. OK.

71
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:34,261
It's not a lot.

72
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,056
On the left side...

73
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,227
What are you doing with that bowl?

74
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,229
What now?

75
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:40,959
- I'm going to make it better.
- No, no, no.

76
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:42,086
- I'm going to make it better.
- Mom!

77
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,965
- I'm going to make it better.
- I'm not six anymore.

78
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,116
Don't put it.

79
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,041
OK, but...

80
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:53,132
OK, but not really short. OK?
Not like you've done before.

81
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:55,428
- Like a layer, OK?
- Like a layer?

82
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,100
OK, with not, like, a bowl.

83
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:59,854
What the fuck did you do?

84
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:02,192
Shut up, Shuji!

85
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,093
- Hi, Maya.
- Hi.

86
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:17,848
You ready for your first day
in a new school, sweetie?

87
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:20,269
- Yes, thanks.
- First year, Mom.

88
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:25,614
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

89
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:28,053
- How did you not tell me? You hair.
- I hate it. I hate it.

90
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:29,789
- Why? It looks so good.
- No, it doesn't.

91
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:31,751
- Are you serious?
- Does it? You swear?

92
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:32,835
Swear.

93
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:36,009
- Swear on my life?
- Swear on your freaking life.

94
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:39,767
OK, I was going for Sarah Michelle Geller,
but then, like, I ended up with this.

95
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:41,938
That's who I was gonna say.

96
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:44,192
But short?
- Yeah, how do I look, though?

97
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:45,779
- You look so good.
- No, I don't.

98
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:47,240
Yes, you do, like, so good.

99
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:49,452
This is just like... doesn't fit me right.

100
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,373
No. It looks amazing.

101
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:56,926
Oh, my God! You got spit on.

102
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,387
Move your bag, dummy.

103
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,724
Don't call me that.

104
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,895
Maya, move your bag.

105
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:05,903
- Are we picking up Sam next?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:16,006
- Hi, Mrs. Kone.
- Hello!

107
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,722
Hi, guys.

108
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:23,605
Maya, what the fuck did you do
to your hair?

109
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,962
- Na, you said it looked good.
- It does look good. I don't know why...

110
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,573
It looks like shit, Maya.

111
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:30,451
Suck my balls, Sam.

112
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:31,746
Suck these balls.

113
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:33,708
- Ew!
- That's nasty, Sam.

114
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,754

115
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:38,133
Hey, Shuji.

116
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:42,518
Happy Eighth grade.

117
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:47,193

- Yeah, this is good.

118

119
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:52,286

- I am.

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,288
- Bye, Mom.
- Go.

121
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:54,959

- What? What?

No, he's hitting Brandt in the balls.

162

166
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:10,271

173
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:28,891

175
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,040
"Brandt loves Maya"
and "Dustin loves Maya."

176
00:08:32,064 --> 00:08:33,358
Anna, what is happening?

177
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:35,905
Oh, my God!

178
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:38,493
I mean, is that like me?

179
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:40,372
- Yeah, it's you.
- Crazy. Wait. Wait. Wait.

180
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:43,086
They're literally the hottest guys
in the school.

181
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,090
Maya, it's happening.

182
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:46,844
Hey, Maya, come over here.

183
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,138
Yeah. Come over here.

184
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:49,725
Oh, my God!

185
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,648
- Come with me. Come with me.
- I can't.

186
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:53,917
- No, no, no. Come with me.
- They didn't say me.

187
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:55,003
- They only said you.
- OK, all right.

188
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:56,112
- OK.
- You got it.

189
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,753
What's up!

190
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,339
You look so different.

191
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:07,844
Thanks. Um...

192
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:11,769
Yeah. I got a...
I got a haircut last minute.

193
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:12,938
Oh, where did you get it?

194
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:14,900
Where did I get it?

195
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:20,787
- At the salon, that was, like, called...
- Superb.

196
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,289
Salon Superb.

197
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:24,001
Hmm. Never heard of that one.

198
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,254
Becca!

199
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:27,007
But whatever you did, it worked.

200
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:30,055
Because Brandt and Dustin obviously think
you're, like, so fine this year.

201
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,976
No, they don't. You guys...

202
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:34,206
- They're totally into you.
- Everyone's talking about it.

203
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,501
- They were staring at you.
- Stop!

204
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:37,946
Yeah, Brandt's so fine,
and they both like you.

205
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:39,950
- Isn't that amazing?
- I know, like, what!

206
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,413
- Crazy!
- It's crazy, you guys,

207
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:45,127
like, I'm losing my mind right now.

208
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:54,103
They think I'm fine,
and Heather likes my haircut.

209
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:55,541
- Brandt loves you...
- Brandt loves Maya...

210
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:57,043
- Dustin loves Maya.
- Dustin loves you.

211
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:59,155
Wait. Wait a second. Wait.

212
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,744
Is there another Maya?

213
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:04,165
- No.
- No.

214
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,085
No. I can't... I can't think of anyone.

215
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:07,964
- Yeah. So it's me.
- It's you.

216
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:09,342
It's me. Oh, my God!

217
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,595
Oh, my God!

218
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,891
Hey! You two!

219
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:14,728
You think you can talk over me?

220
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,607
No.

221
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,195
Oh, thank you.

222
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,201
I've got my eye on you two.

223
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,708
Oh, my God!

224
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:32,346
- Come, come on.
- Get him, get him.

225
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:35,854
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry,
but, like, here comes Brandt.

226
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,314
God, no!

227
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,445
OK, just throw it.

228
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,955
Stop! Stop. Stop!

229
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:51,426

- Yeah, I know.
- He is so cute.

237
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:17,938

243
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:40,525
- Sorry.
- Anna, that's you. Oh, my God, go.

244
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:44,908
Go, Na!

245
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,121
You got this.

246
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,710
Kick it, Na!

247
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,337
Kick it. Kick it!

248
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:02,192
Man down. Everybody, sit down.

249
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:05,908
Hey, you! Take your victim to the nurse.

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,630
I'm really, really, really, really sorry.

251
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:14,968
It's chill.

252
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:18,809
Um, it's crazy, though,

253
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:21,899
because you don't even look bad
with blood on your face.

254
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:27,242
Um, do you know my friend Maya?

255
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:28,537
Nah.

256
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:33,379
Oh, my God, that... that's crazy.

257
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:34,841
That's her nickname for me.

258
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,302
Na.

259
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:39,350
Um, she's my best friend. She's amazing,

260
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:42,774
and actually two of your best friends
are, like, in love with her.

261
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:45,905
So it's like, how do you pick, you know,

262
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:48,744
'cause, like, I've only ever been in love
with one person.

263
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:57,052
Brandt's nice, but you know,
Dustin has an earring.

264
00:12:57,135 --> 00:12:58,639
Dustin's a bitch.

265
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:04,526
Dustin is a bitch?

266
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,285
Dustin is a bitch.

267
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:10,453
A bitch?

268
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:12,499
- That's what Alex said.
- Oh, my God.

269
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,564
Yeah, so I really think that you should
just go with Brandt.

270
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:16,592
I mean, obviously, whatever you wanna do.

271
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:18,344
But do you really wanna do with the bitch

272
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:19,708
that doesn't hang out with Alex?

273
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:22,743
I don't know. Maybe being with a bitch
is the best thing for me.

274
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:25,400
Look, I like his earring. Shit.

275
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:28,424
Can't believe they're not friends.
They're not best friends?

276
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:30,327
Yeah, I mean, obviously, not anymore.

277
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,830
That is crazy.

278
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:34,878
OK. Well,
then I don't wanna be with him. I don't.

279
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,900
I only wanna be with someone
who's best friends with Alex,

280
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:39,195
'cause I wanna be in the same room
with you for our first fingers.

281
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,057
Like, I'm not gonna do without you.

282
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,102
Seriously, like, I'm gonna go with Brandt.

283
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:45,440
Quiet, please.
Settle down.

284
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,031
Young sir in the Care Bear sweatshirt.

285
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:50,114
Huh?

286
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:51,536
She's a girl.

287
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:53,081
Yeah, I'm a girl.

288
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:56,212
Care to share something you did
over the summer?

289
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:58,424
Come up to the front.

290
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:07,876
Um...

291
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:11,325
I guess, like, the most memorable thing
I did over this summer

292
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:14,666
was I watched <i>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,</i>
like, six times in a row.

293
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,545
And it is, like, really funny.

294
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:21,470
'Cause he does, like, all this like,
rewind, like, fast forward stuff, like...

295
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:24,435
I'll just do it. It's like...

296
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:27,817
"I really wanna play, Coach.
Just give me a chance.

297
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:30,614
Let's see that in instant slow-mo."

298
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:52,992
Really makes me laugh.

299
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:55,539
And he does this other thing,
where he's like...

300
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,086
Ahhh!

301
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,978
Sit down.

302
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,072
Enough of that.

303
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:15,120
OK. Everyone,
take out your summer reading,

304
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:17,082
and get into groups of four.

305
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:20,840
Uh, John, Lydia, Jafeer...

306
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:24,429
OK, so, what do you think about this
if I give that to Brandt?

307
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,818
Um, it could go like this.

308
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,691
Look,
I feel like it needs a question.

309
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:43,009
OK. Yeah, I know. You're right.

310
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:45,388
And then put my name,
'cause he won't know who it is.

311
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:47,434
Perfect.

312
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,152
So exciting.

313
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,663
OK, Brandt.

314
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:04,886
I'm gonna, like, have my first boyfriend.

315
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:06,053
No doubt.

316
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:07,725
That's freaking crazy.

317
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:09,454
It's amazing, and we'll go on, like,
double dates and stuff.

318
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:10,648
I know, with, like, Alex.

319
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:11,942
I mean, if he wants to.

320
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,820
Dustin says yes. Dustin says yes.

321
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:15,049
- Brandt says yes.
- I do not say yes.

322
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:15,991
- Yes, he does.
- No, I do not.

323
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:16,993
- Yes, he does.
- No, I do not.

324
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,622
Oh, my God, wait.

325
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:20,545
Dustin, that is, like,
so presumptuous to think

326
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:22,064
that she's asking you. She asked him.

327
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:23,590
You guys, stop.

328
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:26,513
This is, like, so mean. Just tell her.

329
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:28,809
U-G-I-S, biyatch!

330
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:30,353
- UGIS.
- UGIS.

331
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:33,735
Wait, what?

332
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:35,531
Oh, honey, don't you know?

333
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:37,535
It means ugliest girl in school.

334
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,006
UGIS!

335
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,759
They're so mean.

336
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:49,200
And they said they don't know
why you are wearing a bra, Anna,

337
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,061
'cause there's nothing to go in it.

338
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:53,609
I'm so sorry.

339
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:58,535
It's cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, this is really funny.

340
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:01,916
UGIS! UGIS!

341
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,379
- Thanks for telling me, Becca.
- You're welcome.

342
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:06,175
- OK.
- Bye.

343
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,595
Bye.

344
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:19,535
It's not they like my haircut.

345
00:17:19,786 --> 00:17:21,246
They're assholes.

346
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:23,209
No. They were right.

347
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:28,344
- I am ugly. I'm a freaking freak.
- No, you're not.

348
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:31,058
Like...

349
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:32,645
I'm UGIS.

350
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:37,822
Maya, if UGIS means beautiful unicorn,

351
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:41,830
then yeah, you... you you're UGIS.
Then, yeah, you are.

352
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:44,334
No. Na, do you understand, like,

353
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:46,673
I'm the ugliest girl in school.

354
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:49,679
You get that in your skull?

355
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:52,518
Like, to love me is the biggest insult.

356
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:54,981
Like, that's what it means.

357
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:02,495
Then I guess, you know,
I've been insulted the greatest.

358
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:21,450
<i>♪ I'm desperate for changing ♪</i>

359
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:25,416
<i>♪ Starving for truth ♪</i>

360
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,466

<i>♪ Letting go of all I've held onto ♪</i>

364
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:47,670
You literally look, like, hot right now.

365
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,679
You know, none of this
actually makes any sense.

366
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:52,763
I know.

367
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:54,927
Like Terra Newback?
It's a hunchback for Pete's sake.

368
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:56,622
Yeah, I know.
Or freaking Cindy Puchak like?

369
00:18:56,646 --> 00:18:58,023
Her mole covers her whole neck.

370
00:18:58,107 --> 00:19:00,152
It's the size of my face, like,
it's bigger.

371
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:01,906
And like, think about Beth Mahoney.

372
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,537
Beth Mahoney is freaking busted like...

373
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,708
- She's UGIS.
- She's so UGIS.

374
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,377
- Like I'm UGIS?
- You're not UGIS.

375
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,883
- Hey, UGIS.
- Go fuck your mom.

376
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,220
They're all a bunch of fuckers.

377
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,272
We just have to do something about this.

378
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:19,525
Anna, I can't.

379
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:23,617
I have an idea.

380
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,706
Do you know where the eighth graders sit?

381
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,825
You shouldn't be here.

382
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,246
- Get out of here, freaks.
- OK.

383
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,517
- Fucking leave.
- We should go.

384
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,378
Shuji, no. It's important. Stop.

385
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:52,381
Um...

386
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:54,762
They were these boys in our grade,

387
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,308
who were not kind to...

388
00:19:57,392 --> 00:19:59,563
- I need you to beat them up, Shuji.
- Yeah.

389
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:01,526
Like, it just needs to happen.

390
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:02,945
Why should I?

391
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,034
See. Like I told you he wouldn't care.

392
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,497
This is literally, like,
the worst day of my life,

393
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:10,836
and he'll probably call me UGIS, too.

394
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:14,342
Did you just say UGIS?

395
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:16,096
Yeah.

396
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:23,945
UGIS is the worst thing you can be called.

397
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:27,035
The list of UGIS's past,
they're all heinous dogs.

398
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:28,120
There's a list?

399
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:31,293
Look, I'm not gonna beat up
a seventh grader,

400
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:32,838
but I can teach you some words.

401
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:35,176
Um, what do they look like?

402
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:38,390
Um. Well, like, um...

403
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:44,110
Brandt, he, like,
has this, like, chestnut silky hair,

404
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:46,364
and it's like, he has brown honeydew...

405
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:48,160
No, what are his bad features?

406
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,999
Oh.

407
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,291
Um...

408
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,884
- I think he's like... he's, like, short.
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,513
- That's true.
- Yeah. That's good.

410
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:58,973
- Is that good?
- Mm-hmm.

411
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,995
- And like, Stacy Davis told me that...
- Oh, yeah.

412
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,739
She gave me a handy
when his dad was sick

413
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:04,150
to help make him feel better,

414
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:06,446
and she said he's not circumcised,

415
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,117
and it looks like an aardvark.

416
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,494
That's what she said.

417
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:11,600
OK, for sure, you're gonna wanna bring up
the aardvark dick.

418
00:21:11,624 --> 00:21:13,795
- OK.
- OK, this is what you're gonna say.

419
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:16,843
Hey, you porcupine midget piece of shit,

420
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:19,557
I would never touch that aardvark dick
with a 10-foot pole,

421
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,476
so suck it, bitch.

422
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:27,029
You got it?

423
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:30,077
Yeah. Yeah.

424
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:31,747
- That was great.
- OK. All right.

425
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:33,417
- OK.
- Don't...

426
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,712
Come on.

427
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:46,234
You guys. You guys!

428
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:50,075
After school,
I'm gonna bitch out Brandt and Dustin.

429
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,038
Magic.

430
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:55,712
She's gonna get her butt kicked.

431
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:03,310
- You can do this.
- Yeah.

432
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:05,165
Like don't let anyone stop you
from your dreams.

433
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,441
Yeah.

434
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:24,185
- What's up?
- So what's up!

435
00:22:24,937 --> 00:22:26,356
- What's up?
- What's up?

436
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:29,028
- You midget!
- What are you doing?

437
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:32,869
- Midget!
- OK.

438
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:34,790
Midget.

439
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:37,587
You midget. Aardvark. You got an aardvark?

440
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:40,259
- You got an aardvark.
- I... I have a dog.

441
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:42,179
Has a dog.

442
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:44,326
- You're a piece of shit!
- Yeah, you're a piece of shit!

443
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,812
Oh, damn, you're gonna take that?

444
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:47,607
Midget piece of shit.

445
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:49,027
Yeah, what?

446
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:52,283
Come on. Come on, fight.

447
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:54,538
Yeah! Yeah! You mi...

448
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:56,082
You midget piece of shit! Yeah!

449
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:57,376
You gonna take that?

450
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,939
- You better take that.
- Yeah, take that.

451
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,800
- You gonna take that?
- What?

452
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:02,596
- You're a midget piece of shit!
- Yeah!

453
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:06,186
And you got an aardvark dick,
and that's why your dad died.

454
00:23:06,394 --> 00:23:12,198
- Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Go! Go!
- Yes!

455
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:20,047
Hey, Brandt, are you OK?

456
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,513
Can't believe you'd bring up his dad.

457
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:25,850
What the fuck? Come on.

458
00:23:25,934 --> 00:23:28,105
You can't help it if Dustin's a bitch.

459
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:29,232
Fuck you!

460
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:30,902
Oh, my God, my mom!

461
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:33,031
- Go! Go!
- Maya...

462
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:35,035
It's OK.

463
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:42,968
Did I go too far today?

464
00:23:43,343 --> 00:23:47,226
<i>I mean, like, it was definitely,
like, intense.</i>

465
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:50,232
I probably shouldn't have said that
about his dad.

466
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:52,236
<i>Yeah. I mean, it was crazy.</i>

467
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,284
<i>- But, like, his dad did die. It's just a fact.</i>
- Oh, wait, Na.

468
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,954
<i>Oh! Mayi?</i>

469
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,169
<i>Mayi? Hello?</i>

470
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:01,922
- Hold on.
<i>- OK.</i>

471
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:11,817
<i>What you doing?</i>

472
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:15,240
<i>I mean, Maya, are you there?</i>

473
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,833
- Oh, my God, Na!
<i>- Oh, my God, what?</i>

474
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,633
- Oh, my God!
<i>- What?</i>

475
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:28,893
Holy f-balls!

476
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,894
Can't do this.

477
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,904
I don't wanna face everyone.

478
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:41,580
I don't wanna do seventh grade.

479
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,418
I'm not doing seventh grade by myself.

480
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:46,255
No, it's gonna be a lot easier
for you now.

481
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:48,009
I mean, like, you should go.

482
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:50,556
Maya.

483
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,773
You are my actual rainbow gel pen

484
00:25:55,817 --> 00:26:00,242
in a sea of blue and black
writing utensils, like...

485
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,138
- I'm not doing it alone.
- Really?

486
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:03,373
Yeah! Duh!

487
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:06,045
- So we'll do it together?
- Yeah.

488
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,527
Just one step at a time.
It's not like it's gonna last forever.

489
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:09,970
- Yeah, it's not.
- Like...

490
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:11,515
And, like, I'll do it you do it.

491
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:16,482
OK. I'll do it if you do it.

492
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,869
Wait.

493
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,753
We have to do it
at the exact same time, OK?

494
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:32,139
