00:10.301 --> 00:13.182
<i>Oh, my God, Na, seventh grade!</i>

00:13.265 --> 00:14.226
I know.

00:14.769 --> 00:16.355
It's gonna be amazing.

00:23.077 --> 00:24.872
<i>Who else is in homeroom with us?</i>

00:24.956 --> 00:27.001
- Like a Sam?
- Oh, my God, he wishes.

00:27.085 --> 00:30.341
He wants you so bad, it's crazy.

00:30.424 --> 00:33.890
Ew, Na! Never in a trillion years,
it's disgusting.

00:33.974 --> 00:36.270
- Like hell no!
- <i>No. I know.</i>

00:36.645 --> 00:38.607
Do you think Alex is still dating Heather?

00:38.691 --> 00:41.405
No, absolutely not.
I heard that they broke up,

00:41.488 --> 00:44.829
<i>because Heather gave a handjob to both
Brandt J. and Dustin L. this summer.</i>

00:44.912 --> 00:45.998
<i>Wait, what?</i>

00:46.081 --> 00:47.793
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- That whole bag?

00:47.877 --> 00:49.379
<i>Such a slut. Oh, my God, also,</i>

00:49.462 --> 00:52.845
I heard that Connie M. grew
double D's her last night at camp.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.222
<i>That's so effed up.</i>

00:54.347 --> 00:55.767
How is that even possible?

00:55.851 --> 00:58.564
<i>I don't know. It, like,
happened in the middle of her sleep.</i>

00:58.647 --> 01:00.401
That's so unfair that
that happens to people...

01:00.484 --> 01:01.653
- <i>I know.</i>
- ...I wish that was me.

01:02.614 --> 01:04.492
- Na?
- <i>Huh?</i>

01:05.036 --> 01:08.125
I'm gonna ask you something,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

01:08.208 --> 01:10.254
<i>- Swear on your life.</i>
- Swear.

01:11.758 --> 01:14.679
Do I look exactly the same as last year?

01:14.764 --> 01:16.099
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- I won't be mad. Tell me.

01:16.183 --> 01:17.518
- Oh, my God, not at all.
- <i>I won't be mad.</i>

01:17.602 --> 01:19.272
- <i>Are you kidding me?</i>
- Really?

01:19.356 --> 01:20.483
<i>Promise.</i>

01:20.566 --> 01:21.861
What are you going to wear tomorrow?

01:21.945 --> 01:24.825
I'm thinking, like, my blue shirt with,
uh, the stripes.

01:24.909 --> 01:26.119
<i>Oh, my God! So cute.</i>

01:26.203 --> 01:28.457
But, like, I'm also thinking
of wearing a bra.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.461
Oh, my God. That's, like, really smart.

01:30.544 --> 01:31.798
You need it for your nipples.

01:33.258 --> 01:34.511
Yeah.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.889
I feel like we should make a pact.

01:35.973 --> 01:39.229
Duh! Let's like...
Let's, like, do everything together.

01:39.312 --> 01:42.402
Yeah, no doubt, like, all our
first together like our first kiss.

01:42.485 --> 01:44.280
- Obviously.
- Yeah, no doubt.

01:44.656 --> 01:45.826
Deal.

01:47.245 --> 01:51.211
Oh, my God!
Seventh grade is gonna be so amazing.

01:51.294 --> 01:52.881
It's gonna be really, really good.

01:52.965 --> 01:55.469
This is gonna be like the best year
of our lives.

01:57.265 --> 01:59.561
Shuji, get off AOL!

02:00.772 --> 02:02.608
<i>Shuji!</i>

02:02.692 --> 02:03.987
Maya?

02:49.995 --> 02:51.289
What's up!

02:53.168 --> 02:54.462
Yeah.

02:55.089 --> 02:57.928
I guess I did change
a lot over the summer.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.809
Like, broke up with my camp boyfriend.

03:00.892 --> 03:03.605
Just like single now, so...

03:04.357 --> 03:07.113
Yeah. Line up.

03:12.331 --> 03:15.337
Do you like it? I changed it last night.

03:15.421 --> 03:17.216
No, it's stupid.

03:17.383 --> 03:20.139
No, it's not. It got layers.

03:23.469 --> 03:24.451
Mom!

03:25.274 --> 03:26.568
- What?
- I'll fix it.

03:26.651 --> 03:27.695
Let me try fixing it.

03:27.779 --> 03:29.657
OK, fine. Just like a couple of layers.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.913
- OK, sit.
- Just on the left side, though, OK?

03:31.996 --> 03:33.958
- Just like a little bit.
- OK. OK. OK.

03:34.042 --> 03:35.461
It's not a lot.

03:35.544 --> 03:37.256
On the left side...

03:37.799 --> 03:39.427
What are you doing with that bowl?

03:39.510 --> 03:40.429
What now?

03:40.512 --> 03:42.099
- I'm going to make it better.
- No, no, no.

03:42.183 --> 03:43.227
- I'm going to make it better.
- Mom!

03:43.310 --> 03:45.105
- I'm going to make it better.
- I'm not six anymore.

03:45.189 --> 03:46.316
Don't put it.

03:46.399 --> 03:50.241
OK, but...

03:51.034 --> 03:54.332
OK, but not really short. OK?
Not like you've done before.

03:54.415 --> 03:56.628
- Like a layer, OK?
- Like a layer?

03:57.714 --> 03:59.300
OK, with not, like, a bowl.

03:59.384 --> 04:01.054
What the fuck did you do?

04:01.137 --> 04:03.392
Shut up, Shuji!

04:14.414 --> 04:16.293
- Hi, Maya.
- Hi.

04:16.376 --> 04:19.048
You ready for your first day
in a new school, sweetie?

04:19.132 --> 04:21.469
- Yes, thanks.
- First year, Mom.

04:23.098 --> 04:26.814
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

04:26.897 --> 04:29.193
- How did you not tell me? You hair.
- I hate it. I hate it.

04:29.277 --> 04:30.989
- Why? It looks so good.
- No, it doesn't.

04:31.072 --> 04:32.951
- Are you serious?
- Does it? You swear?

04:33.035 --> 04:33.995
Swear.

04:34.287 --> 04:37.209
- Swear on my life?
- Swear on your freaking life.

04:37.293 --> 04:40.967
OK, I was going for Sarah Michelle Geller,
but then, like, I ended up with this.

04:41.886 --> 04:43.138
That's who I was gonna say.

04:43.305 --> 04:45.392
But short?
- Yeah, how do I look, though?

04:45.476 --> 04:46.979
- You look so good.
- No, I don't.

04:47.063 --> 04:48.440
Yes, you do, like, so good.

04:48.523 --> 04:50.652
This is just like... doesn't fit me right.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.573
No. It looks amazing.

04:56.791 --> 04:58.126
Oh, my God! You got spit on.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.587
Move your bag, dummy.

04:59.670 --> 05:00.924
Don't call me that.

05:01.383 --> 05:03.095
Maya, move your bag.

05:05.391 --> 05:07.103
- Are we picking up Sam next?
- Yeah.

05:15.912 --> 05:17.206
- Hi, Mrs. Kone.
- Hello!

05:19.210 --> 05:20.922
Hi, guys.

05:22.007 --> 05:24.805
Maya, what the fuck did you do
to your hair?

05:25.389 --> 05:28.103
- Na, you said it looked good.
- It does look good. I don't know why...

05:28.186 --> 05:29.773
It looks like shit, Maya.

05:29.857 --> 05:31.651
Suck my balls, Sam.

05:31.735 --> 05:32.946
Suck these balls.

05:33.029 --> 05:34.908
- Ew!
- That's nasty, Sam.

05:35.409 --> 05:36.954
God!

05:38.248 --> 05:39.333
Hey, Shuji.

05:42.131 --> 05:43.718
Happy Eighth grade.

05:46.222 --> 05:48.393
- Mom!
- Yeah, this is good.

05:48.853 --> 05:51.942
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

05:52.026 --> 05:53.486
- Maya, be cool.
- I am.

05:53.570 --> 05:54.488
- Bye, Mom.
- Go.

05:54.572 --> 05:56.159
Thank you, Kathy.

05:56.242 --> 05:57.578
- Oh, my God. Maya? Maya?
- What? What?

05:57.661 --> 05:59.917
We have to do it at the exact same time.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.254
- Oh, yeah.
- First steps in the middle school.

06:04.383 --> 06:06.221
OK, ready? Wait.

06:06.679 --> 06:09.811
One, two, three.

06:37.408 --> 06:38.451
Watch out.

06:41.374 --> 06:42.877
Oh, my God!

06:42.961 --> 06:45.590
Connie M. is totally best friends
with Heather now.

06:45.674 --> 06:46.927
Ooh. Oh, my God!

06:47.011 --> 06:49.348
It's fricking true. They're ginormous!

07:13.271 --> 07:15.108
- Jessica Abrams.
- Here.

07:15.735 --> 07:18.114
- Anna Kone?
- Present.

07:18.448 --> 07:21.037
- Uh, Brent Jackson?
- President!

07:22.164 --> 07:24.418
OK. Cool guy.

07:25.128 --> 07:28.093
- Uh, Maya Ishii-Peters.
- Present.

07:28.677 --> 07:31.099
Ishii... Oishi... you making me hungry.

07:31.182 --> 07:32.894
That means food, right?

07:32.977 --> 07:36.275
Yeah. That's crazy. How do you know that?

07:36.359 --> 07:39.115
Spent a little time in Japan
teaching English in my 20s...

07:41.369 --> 07:43.623
- Right. Rebecca Roth?
- Here.

07:43.708 --> 07:45.043
- Maya.
- What?

07:45.502 --> 07:48.091
Um, is Alex looking at me?

07:48.341 --> 07:51.264
- Robert Terry?
- Here.

07:51.347 --> 07:53.435
- Julie Burger?
- No.

07:53.685 --> 07:55.898
How about now? Hold on.

07:55.982 --> 07:56.900
Present.

07:57.443 --> 07:58.445
No.

07:58.821 --> 08:01.159
No, he's hitting Brandt in the balls.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.538
Hey. Don't. Get away from my balls.

08:03.621 --> 08:05.752
- Brian Carter?
- Here.

08:05.835 --> 08:07.839
- He'll probably look at me later.
- Yeah.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.760
OK. Listen up, everyone.

08:09.843 --> 08:11.471
I have your locker assignments.

08:11.554 --> 08:14.143
So you can just... take it outside.

08:19.695 --> 08:21.407
- Oh, my God!
- What are these?

08:21.491 --> 08:22.576
What are what?

08:22.659 --> 08:24.079
There's, like, all these signs.

08:24.706 --> 08:26.292
"Brandt loves Maya."

08:26.794 --> 08:28.588
"Dustin loves Maya."

08:28.671 --> 08:30.091
It says down there, too.

08:30.802 --> 08:31.887
Oh, my God! They all say

08:31.970 --> 08:33.181
"Brandt loves Maya"
and "Dustin loves Maya."

08:33.264 --> 08:34.558
Anna, what is happening?

08:35.895 --> 08:37.105
Oh, my God!

08:37.397 --> 08:39.693
I mean, is that like me?

08:39.778 --> 08:41.572
- Yeah, it's you.
- Crazy. Wait. Wait. Wait.

08:41.656 --> 08:44.286
They're literally the hottest guys
in the school.

08:44.370 --> 08:46.290
Maya, it's happening.

08:46.374 --> 08:48.044
Hey, Maya, come over here.

08:48.127 --> 08:49.338
Yeah. Come over here.

08:49.672 --> 08:50.925
Oh, my God!

08:51.676 --> 08:53.848
- Come with me. Come with me.
- I can't.

08:53.931 --> 08:55.058
- No, no, no. Come with me.
- They didn't say me.

08:55.141 --> 08:56.143
- They only said you.
- OK, all right.

08:56.227 --> 08:57.312
- OK.
- You got it.

09:03.784 --> 09:04.953
What's up!

09:05.036 --> 09:06.539
You look so different.

09:08.001 --> 09:09.044
Thanks. Um...

09:09.838 --> 09:12.969
Yeah. I got a...
I got a haircut last minute.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.138
Oh, where did you get it?

09:14.764 --> 09:16.100
Where did I get it?

09:17.561 --> 09:21.987
- At the salon, that was, like, called...
- Superb.

09:22.070 --> 09:23.489
Salon Superb.

09:23.656 --> 09:25.201
Hmm. Never heard of that one.

09:25.285 --> 09:26.454
Becca!

09:26.537 --> 09:28.207
But whatever you did, it worked.

09:28.291 --> 09:31.255
Because Brandt and Dustin obviously think
you're, like, so fine this year.

09:31.339 --> 09:33.176
No, they don't. You guys...

09:33.343 --> 09:35.347
- They're totally into you.
- Everyone's talking about it.

09:35.430 --> 09:36.641
- They were staring at you.
- Stop!

09:36.725 --> 09:39.146
Yeah, Brandt's so fine,
and they both like you.

09:39.229 --> 09:41.150
- Isn't that amazing?
- I know, like, what!

09:41.233 --> 09:43.613
- Crazy!
- It's crazy, you guys,

09:43.696 --> 09:46.327
like, I'm losing my mind right now.

09:52.464 --> 09:55.303
They think I'm fine,
and Heather likes my haircut.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.597
- Brandt loves you...
- Brandt loves Maya...

09:56.765 --> 09:58.184
- Dustin loves Maya.
- Dustin loves you.

09:58.267 --> 10:00.355
Wait. Wait a second. Wait.

10:01.565 --> 10:02.944
Is there another Maya?

10:04.154 --> 10:05.365
- No.
- No.

10:05.448 --> 10:07.285
No. I can't... I can't think of anyone.

10:07.369 --> 10:09.164
- Yeah. So it's me.
- It's you.

10:09.248 --> 10:10.542
It's me. Oh, my God!

10:10.710 --> 10:11.795
Oh, my God!

10:11.878 --> 10:14.091
Hey! You two!

10:14.174 --> 10:15.928
You think you can talk over me?

10:16.470 --> 10:17.807
No.

10:19.184 --> 10:20.395
Oh, thank you.

10:21.940 --> 10:23.401
I've got my eye on you two.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.908
Oh, my God!

10:31.793 --> 10:33.546
- Come, come on.
- Get him, get him.

10:33.714 --> 10:37.054
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry,
but, like, here comes Brandt.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.514
God, no!

10:39.976 --> 10:41.645
OK, just throw it.

10:43.776 --> 10:46.155
Stop! Stop. Stop!

11:00.266 --> 11:02.855
But then again, there's Dustin. He's fly.

11:06.988 --> 11:09.409
His earring is so hot.

11:09.493 --> 11:11.873
- Yeah, I know.
- He is so cute.

11:15.965 --> 11:19.138
And then there's... him.

11:36.505 --> 11:39.721
Earth to Blondie! Batter up!

11:39.804 --> 11:41.725
- Sorry.
- Anna, that's you. Oh, my God, go.

11:44.688 --> 11:46.108
Go, Na!

11:46.650 --> 11:48.321
You got this.

11:49.281 --> 11:50.910
Kick it, Na!

11:51.076 --> 11:52.537
Kick it. Kick it!

11:59.635 --> 12:03.392
Man down. Everybody, sit down.

12:03.476 --> 12:07.108
Hey, you! Take your victim to the nurse.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.830
I'm really, really, really, really sorry.

12:14.916 --> 12:16.168
It's chill.

12:17.755 --> 12:20.009
Um, it's crazy, though,

12:20.093 --> 12:23.099
because you don't even look bad
with blood on your face.

12:26.021 --> 12:28.442
Um, do you know my friend Maya?

12:28.526 --> 12:29.737
Nah.

12:31.365 --> 12:34.579
Oh, my God, that... that's crazy.

12:34.663 --> 12:36.041
That's her nickname for me.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.502
Na.

12:37.627 --> 12:40.550
Um, she's my best friend. She's amazing,

12:40.633 --> 12:43.974
and actually two of your best friends
are, like, in love with her.

12:45.435 --> 12:47.105
So it's like, how do you pick, you know,

12:47.188 --> 12:49.944
'cause, like, I've only ever been in love
with one person.

12:55.163 --> 12:58.252
Brandt's nice, but you know,
Dustin has an earring.

12:58.335 --> 12:59.839
Dustin's a bitch.

13:03.095 --> 13:05.726
Dustin is a bitch?

13:09.191 --> 13:10.485
Dustin is a bitch.

13:10.568 --> 13:11.653
A bitch?

13:11.738 --> 13:13.699
- That's what Alex said.
- Oh, my God.

13:13.784 --> 13:15.704
Yeah, so I really think that you should
just go with Brandt.

13:15.788 --> 13:17.792
I mean, obviously, whatever you wanna do.

13:17.875 --> 13:19.544
But do you really wanna do with the bitch

13:19.628 --> 13:20.839
that doesn't hang out with Alex?

13:21.423 --> 13:23.887
I don't know. Maybe being with a bitch
is the best thing for me.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.600
Look, I like his earring. Shit.

13:27.268 --> 13:29.564
Can't believe they're not friends.
They're not best friends?

13:29.648 --> 13:31.527
Yeah, I mean, obviously, not anymore.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.030
That is crazy.

13:33.114 --> 13:36.078
OK. Well,
then I don't wanna be with him. I don't.

13:36.161 --> 13:38.040
I only wanna be with someone
who's best friends with Alex,

13:38.124 --> 13:40.336
'cause I wanna be in the same room
with you for our first fingers.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.257
Like, I'm not gonna do without you.

13:42.340 --> 13:44.302
Seriously, like, I'm gonna go with Brandt.

13:44.386 --> 13:46.640
Quiet, please.
Settle down.

13:47.058 --> 13:50.231
Young sir in the Care Bear sweatshirt.

13:50.314 --> 13:51.275
Huh?

13:51.358 --> 13:52.736
She's a girl.

13:53.195 --> 13:54.281
Yeah, I'm a girl.

13:54.364 --> 13:57.412
Care to share something you did
over the summer?

13:57.997 --> 13:59.624
Come up to the front.

14:08.076 --> 14:08.944
Um...

14:09.144 --> 14:12.525
I guess, like, the most memorable thing
I did over this summer

14:12.609 --> 14:15.866
was I watched <i>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,</i>
like, six times in a row.

14:16.283 --> 14:17.745
And it is, like, really funny.

14:18.662 --> 14:22.670
'Cause he does, like, all this like,
rewind, like, fast forward stuff, like...

14:23.297 --> 14:25.635
I'll just do it. It's like...

14:26.721 --> 14:29.017
"I really wanna play, Coach.
Just give me a chance.

14:29.684 --> 14:31.814
Let's see that in instant slow-mo."

14:52.063 --> 14:54.192
Really makes me laugh.

14:54.276 --> 14:56.739
And he does this other thing,
where he's like...

14:57.741 --> 14:59.286
Ahhh!

15:06.133 --> 15:08.178
Sit down.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.272
Enough of that.

15:13.355 --> 15:16.320
OK. Everyone,
take out your summer reading,

15:16.486 --> 15:18.282
and get into groups of four.

15:18.365 --> 15:22.040
Uh, John, Lydia, Jafeer...

15:22.123 --> 15:25.629
OK, so, what do you think about this
if I give that to Brandt?

15:29.930 --> 15:32.018
Um, it could go like this.

15:41.495 --> 15:42.831
Look,
I feel like it needs a question.

15:42.915 --> 15:44.209
OK. Yeah, I know. You're right.

15:44.292 --> 15:46.588
And then put my name,
'cause he won't know who it is.

15:47.632 --> 15:48.634
Perfect.

15:51.849 --> 15:53.352
So exciting.

15:56.650 --> 15:58.863
OK, Brandt.

16:03.205 --> 16:06.086
I'm gonna, like, have my first boyfriend.

16:06.253 --> 16:07.213
No doubt.

16:07.296 --> 16:08.925
That's freaking crazy.

16:09.008 --> 16:10.594
It's amazing, and we'll go on, like,
double dates and stuff.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.848
I know, with, like, Alex.

16:11.931 --> 16:13.142
I mean, if he wants to.

16:13.559 --> 16:15.020
Dustin says yes. Dustin says yes.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.189
- Brandt says yes.
- I do not say yes.

16:16.273 --> 16:17.191
- Yes, he does.
- No, I do not.

16:17.275 --> 16:18.193
- Yes, he does.
- No, I do not.

16:18.277 --> 16:19.822
Oh, my God, wait.

16:19.905 --> 16:21.700
Dustin, that is, like,
so presumptuous to think

16:21.784 --> 16:23.245
that she's asking you. She asked him.

16:23.328 --> 16:24.790
You guys, stop.

16:24.874 --> 16:27.713
This is, like, so mean. Just tell her.

16:28.046 --> 16:30.009
U-G-I-S, biyatch!

16:30.092 --> 16:31.553
- UGIS.
- UGIS.

16:33.682 --> 16:34.935
Wait, what?

16:35.102 --> 16:36.731
Oh, honey, don't you know?

16:36.814 --> 16:38.735
It means ugliest girl in school.

16:41.908 --> 16:45.206
UGIS!

16:45.331 --> 16:46.959
They're so mean.

16:48.128 --> 16:49.840
And they said they don't know
why you are wearing a bra, Anna,

16:50.424 --> 16:52.261
'cause there's nothing to go in it.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.809
I'm so sorry.

16:56.686 --> 16:59.735
It's cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, this is really funny.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.116
UGIS! UGIS!

17:03.408 --> 17:05.579
- Thanks for telling me, Becca.
- You're welcome.

17:05.663 --> 17:07.375
- OK.
- Bye.

17:07.458 --> 17:08.795
Bye.

17:18.146 --> 17:20.735
It's not they like my haircut.

17:20.986 --> 17:22.446
They're assholes.

17:22.697 --> 17:24.409
No. They were right.

17:25.286 --> 17:29.544
- I am ugly. I'm a freaking freak.
- No, you're not.

17:30.045 --> 17:32.258
Like...

17:32.425 --> 17:33.845
I'm UGIS.

17:34.596 --> 17:39.022
Maya, if UGIS means beautiful unicorn,

17:39.314 --> 17:43.030
then yeah, you... you you're UGIS.
Then, yeah, you are.

17:43.113 --> 17:45.534
No. Na, do you understand, like,

17:45.618 --> 17:47.873
I'm the ugliest girl in school.

17:48.373 --> 17:50.879
You get that in your skull?

17:51.212 --> 17:53.718
Like, to love me is the biggest insult.

17:53.843 --> 17:56.181
Like, that's what it means.

17:59.855 --> 18:03.695
Then I guess, you know,
I've been insulted the greatest.

18:44.945 --> 18:48.870
You literally look, like, hot right now.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.878
You know, none of this
actually makes any sense.

18:52.961 --> 18:53.963
I know.

18:54.047 --> 18:56.092
Like Terra Newback?
It's a hunchback for Pete's sake.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.763
Yeah, I know.
Or freaking Cindy Puchak like?

18:57.846 --> 18:59.223
Her mole covers her whole neck.

18:59.307 --> 19:01.352
It's the size of my face, like,
it's bigger.

19:01.436 --> 19:03.106
And like, think about Beth Mahoney.

19:03.190 --> 19:05.737
Beth Mahoney is freaking busted like...

19:05.820 --> 19:07.908
- She's UGIS.
- She's so UGIS.

19:07.991 --> 19:09.577
- Like I'm UGIS?
- You're not UGIS.

19:09.660 --> 19:12.083
- Hey, UGIS.
- Go fuck your mom.

19:12.793 --> 19:14.420
They're all a bunch of fuckers.

19:17.803 --> 19:19.472
We just have to do something about this.

19:19.555 --> 19:20.725
Anna, I can't.

19:23.522 --> 19:24.817
I have an idea.

19:25.985 --> 19:27.906
Do you know where the eighth graders sit?

19:44.480 --> 19:46.025
You shouldn't be here.

19:46.651 --> 19:48.446
- Get out of here, freaks.
- OK.

19:48.530 --> 19:49.657
- Fucking leave.
- We should go.

19:49.741 --> 19:51.578
Shuji, no. It's important. Stop.

19:52.572 --> 19:53.581
Um...

19:53.623 --> 19:55.962
They were these boys in our grade,

19:56.045 --> 19:58.508
who were not kind to...

19:58.592 --> 20:00.763
- I need you to beat them up, Shuji.
- Yeah.

20:00.847 --> 20:02.726
Like, it just needs to happen.

20:02.893 --> 20:04.145
Why should I?

20:04.980 --> 20:07.234
See. Like I told you he wouldn't care.

20:07.318 --> 20:09.697
This is literally, like,
the worst day of my life,

20:09.781 --> 20:12.036
and he'll probably call me UGIS, too.

20:13.915 --> 20:15.542
Did you just say UGIS?

20:15.877 --> 20:17.296
Yeah.

20:22.974 --> 20:25.145
UGIS is the worst thing you can be called.

20:25.229 --> 20:28.235
The list of UGIS's past,
they're all heinous dogs.

20:28.318 --> 20:29.320
There's a list?

20:30.072 --> 20:32.493
Look, I'm not gonna beat up
a seventh grader,

20:32.576 --> 20:34.038
but I can teach you some words.

20:34.831 --> 20:36.376
Um, what do they look like?

20:36.542 --> 20:39.590
Um. Well, like, um...

20:40.885 --> 20:45.310
Brandt, he, like,
has this, like, chestnut silky hair,

20:45.394 --> 20:47.564
and it's like, he has brown honeydew...

20:47.648 --> 20:49.360
No, what are his bad features?

20:50.780 --> 20:52.199
Oh.

20:52.491 --> 20:53.410
Um...

20:53.576 --> 20:57.084
- I think he's like... he's, like, short.
- Mm-hmm.

20:57.167 --> 20:58.713
- That's true.
- Yeah. That's good.

20:58.796 --> 21:00.173
- Is that good?
- Mm-hmm.

21:00.257 --> 21:02.136
- And like, Stacy Davis told me that...
- Oh, yeah.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.931
...she gave me a handy
when his dad was sick

21:04.015 --> 21:05.350
to help make him feel better,

21:05.434 --> 21:07.646
and she said he's not circumcised,

21:07.731 --> 21:09.317
and it looks like an aardvark.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.694
That's what she said.

21:10.778 --> 21:12.741
OK, for sure, you're gonna wanna bring up
the aardvark dick.

21:12.824 --> 21:14.995
- OK.
- OK, this is what you're gonna say.

21:15.078 --> 21:18.043
Hey, you porcupine midget piece of shit,

21:18.126 --> 21:20.757
I would never touch that aardvark dick
with a 10-foot pole,

21:20.840 --> 21:22.676
so suck it, bitch.

21:27.102 --> 21:28.229
You got it?

21:29.106 --> 21:31.277
Yeah. Yeah.

21:31.444 --> 21:32.947
- That was great.
- OK. All right.

21:33.031 --> 21:34.617
- OK.
- Don't...

21:34.700 --> 21:35.912
Come on.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.434
You guys. You guys!

21:47.977 --> 21:51.275
After school,
I'm gonna bitch out Brandt and Dustin.

21:51.735 --> 21:53.238
Magic.

21:54.573 --> 21:56.912
She's gonna get her butt kicked.

22:03.299 --> 22:04.510
- You can do this.
- Yeah.

22:04.677 --> 22:06.305
Like don't let anyone stop you
from your dreams.

22:06.389 --> 22:07.641
Yeah.

22:23.214 --> 22:25.385
- What's up?
- So what's up!

22:26.137 --> 22:27.556
- What's up?
- What's up?

22:28.099 --> 22:30.228
- You midget!
- What are you doing?

22:32.024 --> 22:34.069
- Midget!
- OK.

22:34.779 --> 22:35.990
Midget.

22:36.199 --> 22:38.787
You midget. Aardvark. You got an aardvark?

22:38.871 --> 22:41.459
- You got an aardvark.
- I... I have a dog.

22:42.002 --> 22:43.379
Has a dog.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.467
- You're a piece of shit!
- Yeah, you're a piece of shit!

22:45.550 --> 22:47.012
Oh, damn, you're gonna take that?

22:47.095 --> 22:48.807
Midget piece of shit.

22:48.891 --> 22:50.227
Yeah, what?

22:52.147 --> 22:53.483
Come on. Come on, fight.

22:53.566 --> 22:55.738
Yeah! Yeah! You mi...

22:55.821 --> 22:57.282
You midget piece of shit! Yeah!

22:57.407 --> 22:58.576
You gonna take that?

22:58.660 --> 23:00.080
- You better take that.
- Yeah, take that.

23:00.163 --> 23:02.000
- You gonna take that?
- What?

23:02.084 --> 23:03.796
- You're a midget piece of shit!
- Yeah!

23:03.963 --> 23:07.386
And you got an aardvark dick,
and that's why your dad died.

23:07.594 --> 23:13.398
- Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Go! Go!
- Yes!

23:19.786 --> 23:21.247
Hey, Brandt, are you OK?

23:23.209 --> 23:24.713
Can't believe you'd bring up his dad.

23:25.297 --> 23:27.050
What the fuck? Come on.

23:27.134 --> 23:29.305
You can't help it if Dustin's a bitch.

23:29.388 --> 23:30.432
Fuck you!

23:30.515 --> 23:32.102
Oh, my God, my mom!

23:32.185 --> 23:34.231
- Go! Go!
- Maya...

23:34.733 --> 23:36.235
It's OK.

23:42.581 --> 23:44.168
Did I go too far today?

23:44.543 --> 23:48.426
<i>I mean, like, it was definitely,
like, intense.</i>

23:48.509 --> 23:51.432
I probably shouldn't have said that
about his dad.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.436
<i>Yeah. I mean, it was crazy.</i>

23:53.519 --> 23:56.484
<i>- But, like, his dad did die. It's just a fact.</i>
- Oh, wait, Na.

23:56.567 --> 23:58.154
<i>Oh! Mayi?</i>

23:59.490 --> 24:01.369
<i>Mayi? Hello?</i>

24:01.452 --> 24:03.122
- Hold on.
<i>- OK.</i>

24:11.973 --> 24:13.017
<i>What you doing?</i>

24:14.854 --> 24:16.440
<i>I mean, Maya, are you there?</i>

24:18.319 --> 24:21.033
- Oh, my God, Na!
<i>- Oh, my God, what?</i>

24:22.619 --> 24:24.833
- Oh, my God!
<i>- What?</i>

24:27.922 --> 24:30.093
Holy f-balls!

25:31.800 --> 25:33.094
Can't do this.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.104
I don't wanna face everyone.

25:40.441 --> 25:42.780
I don't wanna do seventh grade.

25:43.907 --> 25:45.618
I'm not doing seventh grade by myself.

25:45.703 --> 25:47.455
No, it's gonna be a lot easier
for you now.

25:47.539 --> 25:49.209
I mean, like, you should go.

25:50.754 --> 25:51.756
Maya.

25:53.175 --> 25:55.973
You are my actual rainbow gel pen

25:57.017 --> 26:01.442
in a sea of blue and black
writing utensils, like...

26:02.110 --> 26:03.279
- I'm not doing it alone.
- Really?

26:03.362 --> 26:04.573
Yeah! Duh!

26:05.074 --> 26:07.245
- So we'll do it together?
- Yeah.

26:07.329 --> 26:09.666
Just one step at a time.
It's not like it's gonna last forever.

26:09.751 --> 26:11.170
- Yeah, it's not.
- Like...

26:11.253 --> 26:12.715
And, like, I'll do it you do it.

26:13.299 --> 26:17.682
OK. I'll do it if you do it.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.069
Wait.

26:24.781 --> 26:27.953
We have to do it
at the exact same time, OK?

26:30.751 --> 26:33.339
One, two...
