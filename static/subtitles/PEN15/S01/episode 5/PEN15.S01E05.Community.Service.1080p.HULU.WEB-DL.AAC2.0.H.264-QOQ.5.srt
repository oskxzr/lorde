1
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:08,768
Wait, look, look.

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,399
- Mr. O's underwear sticking out.
- Oh, my God!

3
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:17,577
I would like put my head in the butt part

4
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:21,794
and I would wear it on my face
as a mask to fall asleep.

5
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:24,090
All right, settle down,
settle down, people.

6
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:26,111
All right, it's Monday.
We got a lot to get through.

7
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:30,352
But first and foremost is signing up for
your mandatory community service project.

8
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:32,524
More like community suck-vice.

9
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,153
I doubt that you will be saying that

10
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:39,161
when you hear these
extremely cool options.

11
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:43,211
OK, Sam's dad is delivering
meals to the homeless.

12
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:45,925
PB&J making party at my house!

13
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:50,434
Yeah... all right.

14
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:52,479
There's a river trash pick up.

15
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:54,985
- You can scrape gum off the bridge.
- That one.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,949
And finally, Heather's mom...

17
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:01,372
is hosting a fashion show
at the nursing home. Huh?

18
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:02,584
OK, now I am so excited.

19
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:03,895
Sign up sheets are in the hallway.

20
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,297
OK, go now! Go, go, go!

21
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,967
Calmly! No running!

22
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:11,017
Maya Ishii-Peters, sign it!

23
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:12,771
No!

24
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,735
No, I'm getting in.
I got it, I got it, I got it.

25
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:19,200
Guys, guys, stop it, stop it.
It's my mom, not yours, OK? It's my mom.

26
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:21,789
Yes!

27
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:23,333
Personal space. Is it your mom?

28
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,188
- I don't think so.
- Maya, we're gonna be supermodels.

29
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:27,216
♪ <i>High</i> ♪

30
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,932

00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:49,511
Litter and say bye to nature
as we know it.

36
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:52,224
Here. Pass this around.

37
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:54,437
She's at that group. Go ask her.

38
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:56,608
Spending time with the elderly

39
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,696
- can be so rewarding.
- Mm-hmm.

40
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:01,325
Whenever Heather and I
visit her grandma in the home,

41
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:02,787
I think to myself,

42
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:05,835
no one else even notices
these people besides us.

43
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,920
So true, you guys!

44
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:12,055
I mean, some of these older people
haven't been noticed in 40, 50 years.

45
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,728
Yeah. So let's fix that.

46
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:18,569
Now what turns heads more than a big,
beautiful hat?

47
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:20,573
Almost nothing.

48
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:22,451
Oh, my God. That's so true. Wow!

49
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:24,915
Luckily, I have my own new line of hats...

50
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:28,547
- Deb's Darling Designs.
- Aw!

51
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:30,843
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

52
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:35,895
And each of you will be wearing one of
my creations as you walk the runway

53
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:39,694
with one of Franklin County's
most forgotten old people...

54
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,409
Hey, um, why aren't you
in your boyfriend's group?

55
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:45,497
She can't leave her best friend.

56
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:48,044
Excuse me. Can you please
go back to your own circle?

57
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,673
Go!

58
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:52,219
Anyway, as I was saying.

59
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:55,058
The actual fashion show is on Saturday...

60
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,895
but we'II have
two rehearsals before that

61
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,459
to make sure you're good at modeling.

62
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,820
The first rehearsal is tomorrow afternoon.

63
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:02,949
Heather, don't speak over me, sweetie.

64
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:06,080
So, please. This is essential.

65
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:09,336
Bring a professional photo
of yourself to the rehearsal.

66
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,257
Headshots at the mall after school

67
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,969
- so we get the best hats.
- Yay!

68
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:16,935
So where... where are you guys
meeting at the...

69
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,440
Should we meet at the Orange Julius?
Or like...

70
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:22,237
Oh, we actually already have reservations.

71
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:23,699
Cool, so do we so...

72
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:25,745
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I know we can't come either.

73
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:26,828
It's fine.

74
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:30,713
- Well, bye, you guys. Whatever.
- Bye, see you guys tomorrow.

75
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,800
- I have a plan.
- OK, what?

76
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:35,096
There's a spot right near my house

77
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,102
and I feel like our pictures
will look exactly like theirs.

78
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:39,898
- Promise?
- I pinky promise.

79
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:42,235
So... what's the plan?

80
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,658
Oh, you are still here?

81
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:50,670
Oh, my gosh, I knew yours
was gonna be beautiful. Great.

82
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:53,132
Oh, so nice. And you know, tomorrow,

83
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:56,515
our next rehearsal,
you'll be meeting your mature partners!

84
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:58,059
Won't that be fun?

85
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:00,898
Jeez!

86
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:06,492
OK... These photos are just incredible.
So beautiful.

87
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:09,833
The zig-zaggy part is so cute
and so is your eye shadow.

88
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,837
- Oh, my God, you guys.
- Oh, my God.

89
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,678
I think your mothers
knew what they were doing,

90
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:17,305
they got you dressed up.

91
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:20,771
Oh, my God! That lip-shade!

92
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:22,859
- Can I borrow that?
- Yes!

93
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,958
Anna, you look so pretty!

94
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,712
Aw. Thanks.

95
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,178
Huh.

96
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,395
Anna, what... what?
I don't know what that is in your photo.

97
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,441
- That's a fan
- It's a fan.

98
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:46,865
OK, you know normally if you want
that kind of the airbrush look,

99
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:48,535
you don't keep the fan in.

100
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,330
Um, thank you for the note.

101
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:52,167
I don't know what you're doing here, Maya.

102
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,523
You know, you almost
look like you were missing

103
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:56,443
and I know you're not
because you're right there.

104
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,529
But I wouldn't even put that.

105
00:04:57,553 --> 00:04:59,407
Honestly I wouldn't even put that
on a milk carton.

106
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,601
Thank you for the note.

107
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:03,439
So, Terra, you know,
she looks like she's from the 1800s.

108
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:07,239
But it's on modern paper
and that... that matters.

109
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:09,493
I found that dress in the river.

110
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,792
OK, so let's go try out our outfits.

111
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,044
OK? Yay!

112
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:16,967
I can basically see my reflection
in your lip-gloss.

113
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,429
- You look so cute!
- So shiny!

114
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:21,977
Oh, my God!

115
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,647
- Do you have any lip-gloss?
- What?

116
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,011
Thanks for letting me borrow these shoes,
Heather Feather.

117
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,279
Duh, babe.

118
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:32,289
- Oh, my God!
- What?

119
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,255
- Heather's wearing a thong.
- Oh, my God, no way.

120
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,215
Yeah.

121
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:40,556
Do I recognize that pink top,
Miss Rebecca?

122
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,727
Um, yeah, Heather let me borrow it.

123
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,570
Um, Heather do you have a pink tank
that I could borrow?

124
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:48,906
Because I lost mine.

125
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:53,665
Um... I'm sorry I'm not really allowed to
let people borrow my clothes.

126
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,102
You know, sometimes people lose them.

127
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:58,257
That's cool like we can buy some
'cause we have...

128
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,928
- Money.
- Money.

129
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:00,846
Yeah.

130
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:02,432
OK, you three...

131
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:04,436
can... can you come over here
for a second, doll?

132
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,691
- You three...
- Yeah?

133
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:11,492
OK can you, um, look more like
the other girls with your outfits?

134
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:13,180
You know because I'd like
the outfits to be

135
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,291
more uniform to match the hats.

136
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,335
Uh-huh.

137
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,097
My hats can do a lot of work
but they can't, you know, do everything.

138
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:22,097
So, can we jus... There we go.
Like, just... yeah.

139
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,727
- Like this?
- You know, back, back, back,

140
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:25,688
there we go.

141
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:28,777
- Jess, you got the best hat.
- Oh, thank you,

142
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:30,502
but Heather definitely got the best hat.

143
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,325
It is quite flattering for me.

144
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,430
- It's just so... oh, so amazing.
- Your hat, like,

145
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:35,290
- match matched your hair.
- So cute.

146
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:38,296
Guys, do you want to see
my grandma's room?

147
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:40,341
- Duh, yes!
- Oh, my God!

148
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:45,059
There's actually, like, not enough room
for everyone so...

149
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:46,604
Um...

150
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:50,529
Ooh, how about raise your hand
if you've been to Heather's house before?

151
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:51,823
That's who can come.

152
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,457
When?

153
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,589
Girl Scouts in second grade.

154
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:00,924
Follow me, guys.

155
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:06,603
- Great idea, Becca.
- Thanks. I know, right?

156
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:08,481
Your hat matched your hair.

157
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,708
What?

158
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,006
Look in there.

159
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,935
- Oh, my God. I know.
- This is what they were using.

160
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,710
No!

161
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:50,356
Oh... my...

162
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:55,116
- Wait. Why did she take that off?
- I don't know.

163
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,412
Wait, I dare you to try it on.

164
00:07:59,457 --> 00:08:02,213
What? I dare you.

165
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:04,760
I triple dog dare you.

166
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,354
- Yeah!
- This is... Oh, my God!

167
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:11,691
- Wait.
- Shh!

168
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:13,695
I can't say no to a triple dog dare.
I can do it.

169
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:16,325
Wait, block me.

170
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:20,727
- Oh, my...
- Put it on, put it on.

171
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,671
Put it on, put it on.

172
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:25,384
Oh, my God! How does it feel?

173
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,806
- Crazy.
- My God. Let me see. Turn around.

174
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,858
- Wait, I wanna try it on!
- Ow!

175
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,779
Wait, I wanna try it on.
Let me try it on.

176
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:37,743
- Stop. Stop.
- No, I wanna try it. Let me!

177
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:40,039
- Oh, my God!
- Heather, stop!

178
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:42,878
Put your pants on.

179
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:45,258
Someone's coming here...

180
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:47,972
Put your pants on.

181
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:49,349
- Stop moving.
- Stop.

182
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:51,854
Stop.

183
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:53,482
Good one, Heather.

184
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,618
Your mom's honking outside.

185
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,037
- OK.
- Thanks, Becca.

186
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,458
- You're welcome.
- Wait, Anna, Anna, Anna.

187
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,339
Why are your pants off?

188
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:07,260
- They weren't.
- They weren't.

189
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:12,478
- Oh, here, that was so fun.
- Yeah.

190
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:14,357
I had a great time.

191
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:15,942
OK.

192
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:22,457
See you tomorrow.

193
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,477
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- I can't believe that happened.

194
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,708
I didn't mean to steal.
I'm gonna give back to her tomorrow

195
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:36,085
- after I wash it. Yeah.
- No, no, no.

196
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,364
- No, that's not fair.
- What do you mean?

197
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,493
You got to try it on and I didn't it.

198
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:42,413
Fine, you can have it. It's on you then.

199
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:43,875
- OK, fine.
- OK, then good.

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,921
Give it... give it...
Give it to me in the car.

201
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:47,508
I will, it hurts. Have fun.

202
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:48,885
Hi, girls.

203
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,597
How did the community service go?

204
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:53,268
I don't know, we learn stuff, Mom, like...

205
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:54,605
All right.

206
00:09:55,774 --> 00:09:57,276
- Seatbelt, girls.
- OK

207
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,738
- Let's just drive.
- OK.

208
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:00,074
Maya...

209
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,257
I'm washing my hands for a while
so no one bother me.

210
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:24,952
One, two, three.

211
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:27,873
Freak!

212
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,595
Damn, white lady.

213
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,234
- Yo
- <i>Hi, Shuji, is Maya there please?</i>

214
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:42,486
Bitch here she be.

215
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:46,286
Woah, you sound different. Um...

216
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:50,670
<i>Anyways, I was just thinking I'm just,
like, feeling a little, like, guilty.</i>

217
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:53,635
<i>- Are you feeling the same thing?</i>
- Yes, bothering me a lot.

218
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,764
You know, I just want to make sure
that you wash it

219
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,621
<i>and that we give it back to her,
like, put it in her bag tomorrow.</i>

220
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:02,401
Uh-huh. For sure, washing it right now.

221
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:05,491
<i>We're just not
that kind of people, like...</i>

222
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,419
<i>we won't take something
on purpose, you know.</i>

223
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:09,792
Bye!

224
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,131
Bye!

225
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,520
Hey.

226
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:41,647
Hey.

227
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:44,820
You notice anything different about me?

228
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:46,866
Baby got back.

229
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:49,037
You still have... Are you serious?

230
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,124
- Maya, no.
- What?

231
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:53,713
You promised
that we give it back, like, stop.

232
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:56,969
Right, you seriously need to chill
'cause I'm gonna give it back tomorrow.

233
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:59,731
Like, nine people have looked at my butt
and my boobs for some reason

234
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:02,606
and I've literally only been here
for ten minutes.

235
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:04,231
Nine.

236
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:06,071
Hey, bowl cut.

237
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:07,657
I mean Maya.

238
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,452
Don't look at me.

239
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:12,164
Ten.

240
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,840
OK, you got checked out ten times.
Like I do... I do, too.

241
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:16,924
Like...

242
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:20,390
- Oh, Alex, look.
- Oh, shit.

243
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:26,402
- I need it.
- What?

244
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,198
It, it, it.

245
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:29,910
- Anna.
- Maya.

246
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:32,039
- What? No.
- Give it to me.

247
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,711
Give me the... Give me the thing.

248
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:47,988
Hey.

249
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,837
Let's make love.

250
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:58,551
I do it all the time.

251
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,746
What happened to your neck?

252
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:17,254
OK, I'm sorry. OK.

253
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,175
She almost caught us.

254
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:29,362
So, now that you've met
your Fashion Show partners,

255
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:34,163
it's important between now
and Saturday to really bond, OK?

256
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:38,965
So turn to your partner and ask
if you are a hat what kind would you be?

257
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,635
I don't really wear hats.

258
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:43,056
Oh, Heather, you're so pretty,

259
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,853
if I were a hat I'd be you.

260
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:49,443
- You make my hair flat.
- Oh, your hair is beautiful.

261
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:51,740
- Your hair is beautiful.
- No, it's not.

262
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,451
I literally already love you.

263
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,665
I'm not kidding.

264
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,713
- You're not? Wow.
- No.

265
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:00,550
Chew, chew.

266
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:08,314
If I were a hat I would be of...
a kind of like...

267
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:12,354
- Oh, my God.
- We could get...

268
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,326
I'll give you... I'll give you a manicure.

269
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:16,832
- OK.
- You give me a foot massage.

270
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,334
OK... now?

271
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:28,146
Can... can... Hel... Can you...
Can you let go?

272
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,649
You're hurting me.

273
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:34,158
Pu, let go. Let go, Pu.

274
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,500
Pu diddly Pu, Pu diddly Pu, let go, yeah?

275
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:47,017
Heath, are you OK?

276
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,979
Yeah, I'm fine I just...

277
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:54,198
lost something.
My mom is going to kill me.

278
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:56,620
Maybe one of us took it home accidentally.

279
00:15:56,703 --> 00:16:02,047
- What is it?
- Um... it-it's private, you guys.

280
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:05,888
I can't really tell you,
but it's... it's pink.

281
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,930
OK.

282
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:08,975
- Let's look for it.
- That's all we need to know.

283
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:10,940
OK, that's a good start.

284
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:13,069
Look, don't worry.

285
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:14,698
- Can I look in your bag?
- Yeah.

286
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:19,081
Pink?

287
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,587
- Anna, why aren't you looking?
- I am.

288
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,218
Someone took it by accident,
it's just really important.

289
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,513
Look in your bag.

290
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,644
I literally looked everywhere,
you guys. I'm freaking out.

291
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:33,903
<i>Oh, my God,
I feel so bad for Heather.</i>

292
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:35,907
I mean, like, we should
definitely give it back.

293
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,869
<i>Like tonight or like...</i>

294
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:41,835
- Tomorrow, yeah.
- <i>Tomorrow, yeah.</i>

295
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,091
- Tomorrow.
- <i>Tomorrow.</i>

296
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,744
- Tomorrow
- Seriously, Anna...

297
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:01,667
give it to me between classes
I'm gonna give it to her.

298
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:04,296
Such a hypocrite!

299
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:16,653
Tomorrow.

300
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,330
Tomorrow.

301
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,713
Hi, Anna.

302
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:40,995
- Tomorrow.
- What?

303
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:44,565
Twenty. 25, 30, I have thirty.
Thirty, 35, 40, I have forty.

304
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:45,628
I have forty.

305
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:48,677
My tallies are through the roof.
My gel pen is basically out of gel.

306
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,598
- So, listen to me.
- I'm listening.

307
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:53,102
- OK, so we have the thing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

308
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:55,315
- We gotta give it back.
- We gotta give it back.

309
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,406
Tomorrow...

310
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,204
- So. To...
- After the...

311
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:04,333
- After the show.
- The show.

312
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,021
- After the show.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. After the show.

313
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:07,065
- After the show.
- We are on the same page.

314
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:08,150
We'll give it back after the show.

315
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,761
- OK, great.
- After the fashion show.

316
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,848
- Yeah.
- Who has show dips?

317
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:16,315
There, let's...

318
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:19,113
- It's only fair rock, paper, scissor.
- OK. I don't care.

319
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,783
On 15, go.

320
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,101
Oh, my God.

321
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,069
OK, ladies, listen up.

322
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:41,742
We don't have much time before the show

323
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:44,664
but as you know
something of Heather's was stolen.

324
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,750
A thong.

325
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,714
Please call it underwear, mom.

326
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:49,883
Shut up, sweetie.

327
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:52,638
Everybody, stand up
and get in a circle please.

328
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:55,351
And whoever took Heather's thong

329
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,648
is going to put it in the middle
of the table

330
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:01,990
and no one will know
because we're going to just turn around,

331
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:06,373
close our eyes and hum
on the count of three. OK?

332
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:08,085
One, two, three.

333
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,871
OK, open your eyes.

334
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,633
- Yeah, yeah, you guys.
- Really?

335
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:33,434
- Gone.
- OK, I see.

336
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,223
No one giving back.
OK. OK.

337
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,435
Well, I don't have time for this shit.

338
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:39,314
I have to take care of the elderly.

339
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:42,697
So, Heather, you're gonna just have
to wear the panties you have on.

340
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:48,082
Guys, seriously, this isn't funny anymore.
Like, if someone took Heather's thong,

341
00:19:48,124 --> 00:19:50,336
- just say so.
- Yeah, you guys...

342
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,342
It must have been Anna, Maya or Terra.

343
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:55,346
- What?
- What?

344
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:57,560
The Bible says no thongs.

345
00:19:57,685 --> 00:19:59,330
Anna and Maya,
you guys were in the changing room

346
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:01,610
when all of us went to see
Grandma Mary's room on Monday.

347
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,864
That's probably when you stole it,
just admit it.

348
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:07,120
- That's insane, you're literally crazy.
- What?

349
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,205
Show me your underwear.

350
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:11,420
- OK, show you our underwear?
- Show me just the top.

351
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:12,590
Are you crazy?

352
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:15,070
- Oh, Maya, show her your underwear.
- OK, show your underwear.

353
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:16,598
Show me your underwear.

354
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:20,438
You guys, you guys, you guys,
this is getting really out of hand.

355
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:22,192
I agree and you're perverted.

356
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:24,822
Can we just let it go, Becca?

357
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:29,582
Let's do the show, let's do the show,
I'm really... I'm really sorry.

358
00:20:29,624 --> 00:20:31,085
I'm sorry you lost it.

359
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,838
Do you guys remember it's about the hats?

360
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,940
Hello, welcome to the Hat Extravaganza.

361
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:44,152
Thank you so much for coming.

362
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,785
I realized a lot of you were already here
so thank you for leaving your rooms.

363
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,668
Also I'd like to thank my pals from my
book club/wine club for being here.

364
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,880
<i>So, please just enjoy yourself.</i>

365
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:56,343
OK, here we go, let's get crazy.

366
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,199
Liar!

367
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:40,431
- She's gonna pull your pants down.
- Who?

368
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,937
Becca...
Becca's gonna pull your pants down.

369
00:21:57,465 --> 00:22:00,973
Oh, no, no, no, stop it.
What's wrong with you? Come with me.

370
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:02,056
Come with me.

371
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:13,497
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we got away with it.

372
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,209
Oh, my God.

373
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,564
Oh, my God. We got away with it, Anna.

374
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:17,816
What are you talking about,
we got away with it?

375
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,070
I was embarrassed in front
of the entire retirement community.

376
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:21,532
- Oh, my God!
- Take off the thong. We don't need it.

377
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:24,979
- No. I'm keeping it.
- "No"?

378
00:22:25,062 --> 00:22:27,233
- Anna, stop it, stop it.
- Take it off, take it off.

379
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,463
- Anna, stop it. You're gonna break it.
- We're not stealers. We're not stealers.

380
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:31,241
Stop!

381
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:32,786
Stop!

382
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,497
No!

383
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:38,255
Are you seriously serious?

384
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:40,761
You, like, burned my asshole.

385
00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:42,640
I'm freaking seriously dead serious

386
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:45,144
'cause that thing
was ripping everybody apart.

387
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:48,359
You literally just, like, ruined my life!

388
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,406
That thong ruined you.

389
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,958
- Damn it.
- And my vagina.

390
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:02,888
I have to say sometimes things just don't
turn out like you planned them, right?

391
00:23:02,972 --> 00:23:05,059
And I apologize for that.

392
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:07,397
You should be apologizing to me.

393
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:12,616
I literally can't talk to you right now
when you have an attitude like that.

394
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:21,049
Pu, can you please tell Anna that I'm not
speaking to her either right now?

395
00:23:23,596 --> 00:23:24,682
Um, Pu...

396
00:23:25,684 --> 00:23:29,692
can you please tell Maya that sometimes
you have to right your wrongs in life

397
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:32,990
or karma will get you which is
exactly what happened to me today?

398
00:23:33,073 --> 00:23:34,753
- Thank you very much.
- You know what, Pu,

399
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:37,916
you please tell Anna
that I'd like a karma to run me over

400
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,587
because she destroyed the one thing

401
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,883
that actually made me feel pretty
like a normal human.

402
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:44,304
- But you're pretty now.
- No, I am not.

403
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:47,644
What is this thing? I mean I want one.

404
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:49,857
- We can't talk about it.
- You know, it's like pink...

405
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:55,159
and it like, it's like,
it has, it's like a stretchy.

406
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:56,244
It wasn't ours.

407
00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:58,666
Yeah, but when it was,
it was really amazing.

408
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:01,296
- See, you're overreacting right now.
- No, I'm not.

409
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,050
- Truly... Tru... Maya...
- Anna...

410
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:06,724
Truly your reaction is telling me
that it's good that we destroyed it.

411
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:09,437
That is literally the most messed up thing
you could ever say

412
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:11,859
because you weren't
ugliest girl in school, OK?

413
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:15,867
No, no, no, no, no, no, not to be corny,
but I gotta say this...

414
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:18,706
All my life I would grow a year older

415
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,792
look back and think
I was prettier the year before

416
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:24,217
I never got to enjoy my beauty

417
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:27,390
but I kept obsessing over it all the time.

418
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:32,943
I wish someone had told me when
I was younger that I was beautiful

419
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:37,201
because of who I <i>was</i> not what I had.

420
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,472
Is she choking?

421
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,651
"I... am... beautiful."

422
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,655
She's saying "I'm beautiful

423
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:59,997
and I don't need things on my body

424
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,792
to make me feel beautiful."

425
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,965
- You got that from that?
- Yeah.

426
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:06,466
Wow.

427
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:12,856
How's everybody holding up? Pu?

428
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:16,363
Something magical just happened.

429
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,003
OK, Pu, stop it.

430
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:27,260
I get it! OK? Let go.

431
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,640
You know what to do.

432
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:41,914
- Maya?
- What?

433
00:25:58,488 --> 00:26:00,952
I'm not abandoning you.
I'm just letting you go

434
00:26:01,912 --> 00:26:06,672
and you're gonna be loved
just like I... love you.

435
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:08,216
Bye.

436
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:10,346
Bye.

437
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:14,062
OK, let's go.

438
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:15,815
- Let's go.
- Are you OK?

439
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:16,881
Yeah.

440
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:20,074
- Proud of you.
- Yeah.

441
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:23,246
- Um, do I look OK?
- Yeah. Do I?

442
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:26,587
Yeah, but it's what's inside
that counts, so...

443
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:29,510
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Right.

444
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,756
♪ <i>Oh, yeah</i> ♪

445
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:54,475
♪ <i>I've been doing my own thing</i> ♪

446
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:00,655
Pu? Pu?

447
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:02,408
I forgot your grapes, OK?

448
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:06,082
Gonna get you some purples, OK?
Purples. I'll be right back.
