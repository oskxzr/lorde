WEBVTT

00:08.748 --> 00:10.585
Wait, look, look.

00:10.610 --> 00:13.699
- Mr. O's underwear sticking out.
- Oh, my God!

00:13.783 --> 00:18.877
I would like put my head in the butt part

00:19.211 --> 00:23.094
and I would wear it on my face
as a mask to fall asleep.

00:23.177 --> 00:25.390
All right, settle down,
settle down, people.

00:25.473 --> 00:27.352
All right, it's Monday.
We got a lot to get through.

00:27.435 --> 00:31.652
But first and foremost is signing up for
your mandatory community service project.

00:31.735 --> 00:33.824
More like community suck-vice.

00:34.449 --> 00:36.453
I doubt that you will be saying that

00:36.537 --> 00:40.461
when you hear these
extremely cool options.

00:40.587 --> 00:44.511
OK, Sam's dad is delivering
meals to the homeless.

00:44.595 --> 00:47.225
PB&J making party at my house!

00:49.229 --> 00:51.734
Yeah... all right.

00:52.068 --> 00:53.779
There's a river trash pick up.

00:53.864 --> 00:56.285
- You can scrape gum off the bridge.
- That one.

00:56.410 --> 00:59.249
And finally, Heather's mom...

00:59.333 --> 01:02.672
is hosting a fashion show
at the nursing home. Huh?

01:02.756 --> 01:03.884
OK, now I am so excited.

01:03.967 --> 01:05.136
Sign up sheets are in the hallway.

01:05.219 --> 01:06.597
OK, go now! Go, go, go!

01:06.680 --> 01:08.267
Calmly! No running!

01:08.351 --> 01:12.317
Maya Ishii-Peters, sign it!

01:12.985 --> 01:14.071
No!

01:14.948 --> 01:17.035
No, I'm getting in.
I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:17.118 --> 01:20.500
Guys, guys, stop it, stop it.
It's my mom, not yours, OK? It's my mom.

01:20.583 --> 01:23.089
Yes!

01:23.172 --> 01:24.633
Personal space. Is it your mom?

01:24.716 --> 01:26.428
- I don't think so.
- Maya, we're gonna be supermodels.

01:47.762 --> 01:50.811
Litter and say bye to nature
as we know it.

01:51.395 --> 01:53.524
Here. Pass this around.

01:54.025 --> 01:55.737
She's at that group. Go ask her.

01:56.405 --> 01:57.908
Spending time with the elderly

01:57.992 --> 01:59.996
- can be so rewarding.
- Mm-hmm.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.625
Whenever Heather and I
visit her grandma in the home,

02:02.835 --> 02:04.087
I think to myself,

02:04.171 --> 02:07.135
no one else even notices
these people besides us.

02:07.218 --> 02:08.220
So true, you guys!

02:08.805 --> 02:13.355
I mean, some of these older people
haven't been noticed in 40, 50 years.

02:13.982 --> 02:16.028
Yeah. So let's fix that.

02:16.111 --> 02:19.869
Now what turns heads more than a big,
beautiful hat?

02:20.536 --> 02:21.873
Almost nothing.

02:21.956 --> 02:23.751
Oh, my God. That's so true. Wow!

02:23.835 --> 02:26.215
Luckily, I have my own new line of hats...

02:28.094 --> 02:29.847
- Deb's Darling Designs.
- Aw!

02:30.389 --> 02:32.143
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

02:32.227 --> 02:37.195
And each of you will be wearing one of
my creations as you walk the runway

02:37.278 --> 02:40.994
with one of Franklin County's
most forgotten old people...

02:41.120 --> 02:44.709
Hey, um, why aren't you
in your boyfriend's group?

02:45.294 --> 02:46.797
She can't leave her best friend.

02:47.006 --> 02:49.344
Excuse me. Can you please
go back to your own circle?

02:49.386 --> 02:50.973
Go!

02:51.056 --> 02:53.519
Anyway, as I was saying.

02:53.602 --> 02:56.358
The actual fashion show is on Saturday...

02:56.400 --> 02:58.195
...but we'II have
two rehearsals before that

02:58.279 --> 02:59.739
to make sure you're good at modeling.

02:59.824 --> 03:02.120
The first rehearsal is tomorrow afternoon.

03:02.203 --> 03:04.249
Heather, don't speak over me, sweetie.

03:04.708 --> 03:07.380
So, please. This is essential.

03:07.422 --> 03:10.636
Bring a professional photo
of yourself to the rehearsal.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.557
Headshots at the mall after school

03:12.640 --> 03:14.269
- so we get the best hats.
- Yay!

03:15.354 --> 03:18.235
So where... where are you guys
meeting at the...

03:18.402 --> 03:20.740
Should we meet at the Orange Julius?
Or like...

03:20.824 --> 03:23.537
Oh, we actually already have reservations.

03:23.621 --> 03:24.999
Cool, so do we so...

03:25.082 --> 03:27.045
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I know we can't come either.

03:27.128 --> 03:28.088
It's fine.

03:28.255 --> 03:32.013
- Well, bye, you guys. Whatever.
- Bye, see you guys tomorrow.

03:32.347 --> 03:34.100
- I have a plan.
- OK, what?

03:34.309 --> 03:36.396
There's a spot right near my house

03:36.480 --> 03:39.402
and I feel like our pictures
will look exactly like theirs.

03:39.444 --> 03:41.198
- Promise?
- I pinky promise.

03:41.281 --> 03:43.535
So... what's the plan?

03:44.412 --> 03:45.958
Oh, you are still here?

03:47.878 --> 03:51.970
Oh, my gosh, I knew yours
was gonna be beautiful. Great.

03:52.053 --> 03:54.432
Oh, so nice. And you know, tomorrow,

03:54.474 --> 03:57.815
our next rehearsal,
you'll be meeting your mature partners!

03:57.898 --> 03:59.359
Won't that be fun?

04:00.821 --> 04:02.198
Jeez!

04:03.492 --> 04:07.792
OK... These photos are just incredible.
So beautiful.

04:07.876 --> 04:11.133
The zig-zaggy part is so cute
and so is your eye shadow.

04:11.299 --> 04:13.137
- Oh, my God, you guys.
- Oh, my God.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.978
I think your mothers
knew what they were doing,

04:17.061 --> 04:18.605
they got you dressed up.

04:19.065 --> 04:22.071
Oh, my God! That lip-shade!

04:22.155 --> 04:24.159
- Can I borrow that?
- Yes!

04:30.504 --> 04:32.258
Anna, you look so pretty!

04:32.467 --> 04:34.012
Aw. Thanks.

04:36.551 --> 04:38.478
Huh.

04:38.520 --> 04:42.695
Anna, what... what?
I don't know what that is in your photo.

04:42.779 --> 04:44.741
- That's a fan
- It's a fan.

04:44.825 --> 04:48.165
OK, you know normally if you want
that kind of the airbrush look,

04:48.415 --> 04:49.835
you don't keep the fan in.

04:49.919 --> 04:51.630
Um, thank you for the note.

04:51.713 --> 04:53.467
I don't know what you're doing here, Maya.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.763
You know, you almost
look like you were missing

04:55.847 --> 04:57.683
and I know you're not
because you're right there.

04:57.767 --> 04:58.769
But I wouldn't even put that.

04:58.853 --> 05:00.648
Honestly I wouldn't even put that
on a milk carton.

05:00.731 --> 05:01.901
Thank you for the note.

05:01.984 --> 05:04.739
So, Terra, you know,
she looks like she's from the 1800s.

05:04.824 --> 05:08.539
But it's on modern paper
and that... that matters.

05:08.664 --> 05:10.793
I found that dress in the river.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.092
OK, so let's go try out our outfits.

05:14.175 --> 05:15.344
OK? Yay!

05:15.804 --> 05:18.267
I can basically see my reflection
in your lip-gloss.

05:18.350 --> 05:20.729
- You look so cute!
- So shiny!

05:20.814 --> 05:23.277
Oh, my God!

05:23.360 --> 05:24.947
- Do you have any lip-gloss?
- What?

05:25.030 --> 05:27.285
Thanks for letting me borrow these shoes,
Heather Feather.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.579
Duh, babe.

05:31.042 --> 05:33.589
- Oh, my God!
- What?

05:34.299 --> 05:37.555
- Heather's wearing a thong.
- Oh, my God, no way.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.515
Yeah.

05:38.557 --> 05:41.856
Do I recognize that pink top,
Miss Rebecca?

05:41.939 --> 05:44.027
Um, yeah, Heather let me borrow it.

05:44.110 --> 05:48.870
Um, Heather do you have a pink tank
that I could borrow?

05:48.995 --> 05:50.206
Because I lost mine.

05:50.289 --> 05:54.965
Um... I'm sorry I'm not really allowed to
let people borrow my clothes.

05:55.049 --> 05:56.301
You know, sometimes people lose them.

05:56.426 --> 05:59.557
That's cool like we can buy some
'cause we have...

05:59.850 --> 06:01.228
- Money.
- Money.

06:01.311 --> 06:02.146
Yeah.

06:02.271 --> 06:03.732
OK, you three...

06:03.816 --> 06:05.736
can... can you come over here
for a second, doll?

06:05.820 --> 06:07.991
- You three...
- Yeah?

06:08.075 --> 06:12.792
OK can you, um, look more like
the other girls with your outfits?

06:12.876 --> 06:14.420
You know because I'd like
the outfits to be

06:14.504 --> 06:16.591
more uniform to match the hats.

06:16.633 --> 06:17.635
Uh-huh.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.349
My hats can do a lot of work
but they can't, you know, do everything.

06:20.432 --> 06:23.397
So, can we jus... There we go.
Like, just... yeah.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.027
- Like this?
- You know, back, back, back,

06:26.111 --> 06:26.988
there we go.

06:27.113 --> 06:30.077
- Jess, you got the best hat.
- Oh, thank you,

06:30.202 --> 06:31.746
but Heather definitely got the best hat.

06:31.831 --> 06:33.625
It is quite flattering for me.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.629
- It's just so... oh, so amazing.
- Your hat, like,

06:35.754 --> 06:36.590
- match matched your hair.
- So cute.

06:36.631 --> 06:39.596
Guys, do you want to see
my grandma's room?

06:39.637 --> 06:41.641
- Duh, yes!
- Oh, my God!

06:41.766 --> 06:46.359
There's actually, like, not enough room
for everyone so...

06:46.401 --> 06:47.904
Um...

06:47.946 --> 06:51.829
Ooh, how about raise your hand
if you've been to Heather's house before?

06:51.912 --> 06:53.123
That's who can come.

06:57.757 --> 06:58.675
When?

06:59.093 --> 07:00.889
Girl Scouts in second grade.

07:00.972 --> 07:02.224
Follow me, guys.

07:04.897 --> 07:07.903
- Great idea, Becca.
- Thanks. I know, right?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.781
Your hat matched your hair.

07:16.669 --> 07:19.008
What?

07:21.054 --> 07:22.306
Look in there.

07:25.396 --> 07:28.235
- Oh, my God. I know.
- This is what they were using.

07:39.799 --> 07:41.010
No!

07:48.442 --> 07:51.656
Oh... my...

07:53.618 --> 07:56.416
- Wait. Why did she take that off?
- I don't know.

07:56.708 --> 07:58.712
Wait, I dare you to try it on.

08:00.757 --> 08:03.513
What? I dare you.

08:04.432 --> 08:06.060
I triple dog dare you.

08:09.734 --> 08:11.654
- Yeah!
- This is... Oh, my God!

08:11.738 --> 08:12.991
- Wait.
- Shh!

08:13.074 --> 08:14.995
I can't say no to a triple dog dare.
I can do it.

08:16.331 --> 08:17.625
Wait, block me.

08:20.714 --> 08:21.967
- Oh, my...
- Put it on, put it on.

08:22.051 --> 08:23.971
Put it on, put it on.

08:24.055 --> 08:26.684
Oh, my God! How does it feel?

08:26.852 --> 08:29.106
- Crazy.
- My God. Let me see. Turn around.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.158
- Wait, I wanna try it on!
- Ow!

08:34.242 --> 08:36.079
Wait, I wanna try it on.
Let me try it on.

08:36.204 --> 08:39.043
- Stop. Stop.
- No, I wanna try it. Let me!

08:39.126 --> 08:41.339
- Oh, my God!
- Heather, stop!

08:42.842 --> 08:44.178
Put your pants on.

08:44.637 --> 08:46.558
Someone's coming here...

08:47.601 --> 08:49.272
Put your pants on.

08:49.397 --> 08:50.649
- Stop moving.
- Stop.

08:52.027 --> 08:53.154
Stop.

08:53.238 --> 08:54.782
Good one, Heather.

08:58.039 --> 08:59.918
Your mom's honking outside.

09:00.002 --> 09:01.337
- OK.
- Thanks, Becca.

09:01.421 --> 09:03.758
- You're welcome.
- Wait, Anna, Anna, Anna.

09:04.803 --> 09:06.639
Why are your pants off?

09:06.723 --> 09:08.560
- They weren't.
- They weren't.

09:09.061 --> 09:13.778
- Oh, here, that was so fun.
- Yeah.

09:13.863 --> 09:15.657
I had a great time.

09:16.242 --> 09:17.202
OK.

09:22.212 --> 09:23.757
See you tomorrow.

09:31.147 --> 09:33.777
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- I can't believe that happened.

09:33.903 --> 09:35.949
I didn't mean to steal.
I'm gonna give back to her tomorrow

09:36.032 --> 09:37.242
- after I wash it. Yeah.
- No, no, no.

09:37.409 --> 09:39.664
- No, that's not fair.
- What do you mean?

09:39.747 --> 09:41.793
You got to try it on and I didn't it.

09:42.002 --> 09:43.713
Fine, you can have it. It's on you then.

09:43.797 --> 09:45.175
- OK, fine.
- OK, then good.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.221
Give it... give it...
Give it to me in the car.

09:47.304 --> 09:48.808
I will, it hurts. Have fun.

09:49.141 --> 09:50.185
Hi, girls.

09:50.268 --> 09:51.897
How did the community service go?

09:52.481 --> 09:54.568
I don't know, we learn stuff, Mom, like...

09:54.652 --> 09:55.905
All right.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.576
- Seatbelt, girls.
- OK

09:58.660 --> 10:00.038
- Let's just drive.
- OK.

10:00.163 --> 10:01.374
Maya...

10:06.050 --> 10:09.557
I'm washing my hands for a while
so no one bother me.

11:23.496 --> 11:26.252
One, two, three.

11:28.173 --> 11:29.008
Freak!

11:33.057 --> 11:34.895
Damn, white lady.

11:38.610 --> 11:42.534
- Yo
- <i>Hi, Shuji, is Maya there please?</i>

11:42.618 --> 11:43.786
Bitch here she be.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.586
Woah, you sound different. Um...

11:47.669 --> 11:51.970
<i>Anyways, I was just thinking I'm just,
like, feeling a little, like, guilty.</i>

11:52.012 --> 11:54.935
<i>- Are you feeling the same thing?</i>
- Yes, bothering me a lot.

11:55.060 --> 11:57.064
You know, I just want to make sure
that you wash it

11:57.481 --> 11:59.777
<i>and that we give it back to her,
like, put it in her bag tomorrow.</i>

11:59.945 --> 12:03.701
Uh-huh. For sure, washing it right now.

12:04.662 --> 12:06.791
<i>We're just not
that kind of people, like...</i>

12:06.959 --> 12:08.419
<i>we won't take something
on purpose, you know.</i>

12:09.965 --> 12:11.092
Bye!

12:11.843 --> 12:14.431
Bye!

12:40.650 --> 12:41.820
Hey.

12:41.945 --> 12:42.947
Hey.

12:43.281 --> 12:46.120
You notice anything different about me?

12:46.746 --> 12:48.166
Baby got back.

12:48.624 --> 12:50.337
You still have... Are you serious?

12:50.420 --> 12:52.424
- Maya, no.
- What?

12:52.507 --> 12:55.013
You promised
that we give it back, like, stop.

12:55.138 --> 12:58.269
Right, you seriously need to chill
'cause I'm gonna give it back tomorrow.

12:58.311 --> 13:01.025
Like, nine people have looked at my butt
and my boobs for some reason

13:01.108 --> 13:03.906
and I've literally only been here
for ten minutes.

13:04.531 --> 13:05.367
Nine.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.371
Hey, bowl cut.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.957
I mean Maya.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.752
Don't look at me.

13:12.464 --> 13:13.299
Ten.

13:14.051 --> 13:17.140
OK, you got checked out ten times.
Like I do... I do, too.

13:17.224 --> 13:18.101
Like...

13:19.561 --> 13:21.690
- Oh, Alex, look.
- Oh, shit.

13:26.242 --> 13:27.702
- I need it.
- What?

13:27.786 --> 13:29.498
It, it, it.

13:29.581 --> 13:31.210
- Anna.
- Maya.

13:31.252 --> 13:33.339
- What? No.
- Give it to me.

13:33.381 --> 13:36.011
Give me the... Give me the thing.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.288
Hey.

13:55.091 --> 13:57.137
Let's make love.

13:57.805 --> 13:59.851
I do it all the time.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.046
What happened to your neck?

14:14.171 --> 14:18.554
OK, I'm sorry. OK.

14:18.638 --> 14:20.475
She almost caught us.

14:27.656 --> 14:30.662
So, now that you've met
your Fashion Show partners,

14:30.829 --> 14:35.463
it's important between now
and Saturday to really bond, OK?

14:35.588 --> 14:40.265
So turn to your partner and ask
if you are a hat what kind would you be?

14:40.390 --> 14:41.935
I don't really wear hats.

14:42.227 --> 14:44.356
Oh, Heather, you're so pretty,

14:44.439 --> 14:47.153
if I were a hat I'd be you.

14:47.696 --> 14:50.743
- You make my hair flat.
- Oh, your hair is beautiful.

14:50.828 --> 14:53.040
- Your hair is beautiful.
- No, it's not.

14:53.124 --> 14:54.751
I literally already love you.

14:55.420 --> 14:56.965
I'm not kidding.

14:57.090 --> 15:00.013
- You're not? Wow.
- No.

15:00.138 --> 15:01.850
Chew, chew.

15:04.229 --> 15:09.614
If I were a hat I would be of...
a kind of like...

15:12.454 --> 15:13.622
- Oh, my God.
- We could get...

15:13.748 --> 15:15.626
I'll give you... I'll give you a manicure.

15:15.752 --> 15:18.132
- OK.
- You give me a foot massage.

15:18.299 --> 15:19.634
OK... now?

15:25.146 --> 15:29.446
Can... can... Hel... Can
you... Can you let go?

15:29.780 --> 15:30.949
You're hurting me.

15:32.327 --> 15:35.458
Pu, let go. Let go, Pu.

15:35.500 --> 15:39.800
Pu diddly Pu, Pu diddly Pu, let go, yeah?

15:46.271 --> 15:48.317
Heath, are you OK?

15:48.401 --> 15:50.279
Yeah, I'm fine I just...

15:51.573 --> 15:55.498
lost something.
My mom is going to kill me.

15:55.581 --> 15:57.920
Maybe one of us took it home accidentally.

15:58.003 --> 16:03.347
- What is it?
- Um... it-it's private, you guys.

16:03.472 --> 16:07.188
I can't really tell you,
but it's... it's pink.

16:07.230 --> 16:08.190
OK.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.986
- Let's look for it.
- That's all we need to know.

16:10.319 --> 16:12.240
OK, that's a good start.

16:13.284 --> 16:14.369
Look, don't worry.

16:14.494 --> 16:15.998
- Can I look in your bag?
- Yeah.

16:19.087 --> 16:20.381
Pink?

16:20.506 --> 16:22.887
- Anna, why aren't you looking?
- I am.

16:22.970 --> 16:26.518
Someone took it by accident,
it's just really important.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.813
Look in your bag.

16:27.897 --> 16:30.944
I literally looked everywhere,
you guys. I'm freaking out.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.203
<i>Oh, my God,
I feel so bad for Heather.</i>

16:35.286 --> 16:37.207
I mean, like, we should
definitely give it back.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.169
<i>Like tonight or like...</i>

16:40.379 --> 16:43.135
- Tomorrow, yeah.
- <i>Tomorrow, yeah.</i>

16:44.179 --> 16:46.391
- Tomorrow.
- <i>Tomorrow.</i>

16:57.080 --> 17:00.044
- Tomorrow
- Seriously, Anna...

17:00.253 --> 17:02.967
give it to me between classes
I'm gonna give it to her.

17:03.802 --> 17:05.596
Such a hypocrite!

17:16.953 --> 17:17.830
Tomorrow.

17:21.461 --> 17:22.630
Tomorrow.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.013
Hi, Anna.

17:40.583 --> 17:42.295
- Tomorrow.
- What?

17:43.505 --> 17:45.844
Twenty. 25, 30, I have thirty.
Thirty, 35, 40, I have forty.

17:45.928 --> 17:46.888
I have forty.

17:47.013 --> 17:49.977
My tallies are through the roof.
My gel pen is basically out of gel.

17:50.019 --> 17:51.898
- So, listen to me.
- I'm listening.

17:51.981 --> 17:54.402
- OK, so we have the thing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:54.486 --> 17:56.615
- We gotta give it back.
- We gotta give it back.

17:56.740 --> 18:00.706
Tomorrow...

18:00.790 --> 18:03.504
- So. To...
- After the...

18:03.629 --> 18:05.633
- After the show.
- ...the show.

18:05.675 --> 18:07.303
- After the show.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. After the show.

18:07.345 --> 18:08.305
- After the show.
- We are on the same page.

18:08.389 --> 18:09.307
We'll give it back after the show.

18:09.474 --> 18:11.061
- OK, great.
- After the fashion show.

18:11.144 --> 18:13.148
- Yeah.
- Who has show dips?

18:15.988 --> 18:17.615
There, let's...

18:17.657 --> 18:20.413
- It's only fair rock, paper, scissor.
- OK. I don't care.

18:20.496 --> 18:22.083
On 15, go.

18:34.190 --> 18:35.401
Oh, my God.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.369
OK, ladies, listen up.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.042
We don't have much time before the show

18:43.125 --> 18:45.964
but as you know
something of Heather's was stolen.

18:46.048 --> 18:47.050
A thong.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.014
Please call it underwear, mom.

18:50.097 --> 18:51.183
Shut up, sweetie.

18:51.224 --> 18:53.938
Everybody, stand up
and get in a circle please.

18:54.022 --> 18:56.651
And whoever took Heather's thong

18:56.735 --> 18:58.948
is going to put it in the middle
of the table

18:59.032 --> 19:03.290
and no one will know
because we're going to just turn around,

19:03.373 --> 19:07.673
close our eyes and hum
on the count of three. OK?

19:07.799 --> 19:09.385
One, two, three.

19:24.499 --> 19:27.171
OK, open your eyes.

19:29.384 --> 19:32.933
- Yeah, yeah, you guys.
- Really?

19:33.016 --> 19:34.734
- Gone.
- OK, I see.

19:34.776 --> 19:36.523
No one giving back.
OK. OK.

19:36.606 --> 19:38.735
Well, I don't have time for this shit.

19:38.862 --> 19:40.614
I have to take care of the elderly.

19:40.698 --> 19:43.997
So, Heather, you're gonna just have
to wear the panties you have on.

19:45.583 --> 19:49.382
Guys, seriously, this isn't funny anymore.
Like, if someone took Heather's thong,

19:49.424 --> 19:51.636
- just say so.
- Yeah, you guys...

19:52.388 --> 19:54.642
It must have been Anna, Maya or Terra.

19:55.102 --> 19:56.646
- What?
- What?

19:57.023 --> 19:58.860
The Bible says no thongs.

19:58.985 --> 20:00.571
Anna and Maya,
you guys were in the changing room

20:00.654 --> 20:02.910
when all of us went to see
Grandma Mary's room on Monday.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.164
That's probably when you stole it,
just admit it.

20:05.247 --> 20:08.420
- That's insane, you're literally crazy.
- What?

20:08.503 --> 20:09.505
Show me your underwear.

20:09.589 --> 20:12.720
- OK, show you our underwear?
- Show me just the top.

20:12.762 --> 20:13.890
Are you crazy?

20:13.973 --> 20:16.269
- Oh, Maya, show her your underwear.
- OK, show your underwear.

20:16.394 --> 20:17.898
Show me your underwear.

20:18.023 --> 20:21.738
You guys, you guys, you guys,
this is getting really out of hand.

20:21.864 --> 20:23.492
I agree and you're perverted.

20:23.575 --> 20:26.122
Can we just let it go, Becca?

20:27.166 --> 20:30.882
Let's do the show, let's do the show,
I'm really... I'm really sorry.

20:30.924 --> 20:32.385
I'm sorry you lost it.

20:32.468 --> 20:34.138
Do you guys remember it's about the hats?

20:39.315 --> 20:43.240
Hello, welcome to the Hat Extravaganza.

20:43.782 --> 20:45.452
Thank you so much for coming.

20:45.577 --> 20:49.085
I realized a lot of you were already here
so thank you for leaving your rooms.

20:49.210 --> 20:52.968
Also I'd like to thank my pals from my
book club/wine club for being here.

20:53.510 --> 20:55.180
<i>So, please just enjoy yourself.</i>

20:55.472 --> 20:57.643
OK, here we go, let's get crazy.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.499
Liar!

21:39.227 --> 21:41.731
- She's gonna pull your pants down.
- Who?

21:41.816 --> 21:44.237
Becca...
Becca's gonna pull your pants down.

21:58.765 --> 22:02.273
Oh, no, no, no, stop it.
What's wrong with you? Come with me.

22:02.356 --> 22:03.275
Come with me.

22:11.583 --> 22:14.797
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we got away with it.

22:14.882 --> 22:16.509
Oh, my God.

22:16.551 --> 22:17.846
Oh, my God. We got away with it, Anna.

22:17.888 --> 22:19.056
What are you talking about,
we got away with it?

22:19.140 --> 22:21.352
I was embarrassed in front
of the entire retirement community.

22:21.394 --> 22:22.771
- Oh, my God!
- Take off the thong. We don't need it.

22:22.856 --> 22:26.279
- No. I'm keeping it.
- "No"?

22:26.362 --> 22:28.533
- Anna, stop it, stop it.
- Take it off, take it off.

22:28.575 --> 22:30.662
- Anna, stop it. You're gonna break it.
- We're not stealers. We're not stealers.

22:30.787 --> 22:32.541
Stop!

22:32.876 --> 22:34.086
Stop!

22:34.170 --> 22:35.797
No!

22:37.384 --> 22:39.555
Are you seriously serious?

22:39.639 --> 22:42.061
You, like, burned my asshole.

22:42.186 --> 22:43.940
I'm freaking seriously dead serious

22:44.065 --> 22:46.444
'cause that thing
was ripping everybody apart.

22:46.528 --> 22:49.659
You literally just, like, ruined my life!

22:50.410 --> 22:52.706
That thong ruined you.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.258
- Damn it.
- And my vagina.

23:00.389 --> 23:04.188
I have to say sometimes things just don't
turn out like you planned them, right?

23:04.272 --> 23:06.359
And I apologize for that.

23:06.442 --> 23:08.697
You should be apologizing to me.

23:10.325 --> 23:13.916
I literally can't talk to you right now
when you have an attitude like that.

23:16.922 --> 23:22.349
Pu, can you please tell Anna that I'm not
speaking to her either right now?

23:24.896 --> 23:25.982
Um, Pu...

23:26.984 --> 23:30.992
can you please tell Maya that sometimes
you have to right your wrongs in life

23:31.117 --> 23:34.290
or karma will get you which is
exactly what happened to me today?

23:34.373 --> 23:35.960
- Thank you very much.
- You know what, Pu,

23:36.085 --> 23:39.216
you please tell Anna
that I'd like a karma to run me over

23:39.258 --> 23:40.887
because she destroyed the one thing

23:40.970 --> 23:43.183
that actually made me feel pretty
like a normal human.

23:43.266 --> 23:45.604
- But you're pretty now.
- No, I am not.

23:45.646 --> 23:48.944
What is this thing? I mean I want one.

23:48.986 --> 23:51.157
- We can't talk about it.
- You know, it's like pink...

23:51.867 --> 23:56.459
and it like, it's like,
it has, it's like a stretchy.

23:56.542 --> 23:57.544
It wasn't ours.

23:57.628 --> 23:59.966
Yeah, but when it was,
it was really amazing.

24:00.384 --> 24:02.596
- See, you're overreacting right now.
- No, I'm not.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.350
- Truly... Tru... Maya...
- Anna...

24:04.433 --> 24:08.024
Truly your reaction is telling me
that it's good that we destroyed it.

24:08.108 --> 24:10.737
That is literally the most messed up thing
you could ever say

24:10.822 --> 24:13.159
because you weren't
ugliest girl in school, OK?

24:13.284 --> 24:17.167
No, no, no, no, no, no, not to be corny,
but I gotta say this...

24:17.668 --> 24:20.006
All my life I would grow a year older

24:20.132 --> 24:22.052
look back and think
I was prettier the year before

24:22.553 --> 24:25.517
I never got to enjoy my beauty

24:25.642 --> 24:28.690
but I kept obsessing over it all the time.

24:29.525 --> 24:34.243
I wish someone had told me when
I was younger that I was beautiful

24:34.326 --> 24:38.501
because of who I <i>was</i> not what I had.

24:47.227 --> 24:48.772
Is she choking?

24:50.400 --> 24:54.951
"I... am... beautiful."

24:55.076 --> 24:56.955
She's saying "I'm beautiful

24:57.039 --> 25:01.297
and I don't need things on my body

25:01.380 --> 25:03.092
to make me feel beautiful."

25:03.969 --> 25:06.265
- You got that from that?
- Yeah.

25:06.766 --> 25:07.684
Wow.

25:11.234 --> 25:14.156
How's everybody holding up? Pu?

25:15.325 --> 25:17.663
Something magical just happened.

25:21.170 --> 25:25.303
OK, Pu, stop it.

25:26.305 --> 25:28.560
I get it! OK? Let go.

25:29.770 --> 25:30.940
You know what to do.

25:41.586 --> 25:43.214
- Maya?
- What?

25:59.788 --> 26:02.252
I'm not abandoning you.
I'm just letting you go

26:03.212 --> 26:07.972
and you're gonna be loved
just like I... love you.

26:08.097 --> 26:09.516
Bye.

26:10.644 --> 26:11.646
Bye.

26:14.318 --> 26:15.362
OK, let's go.

26:15.445 --> 26:17.115
- Let's go.
- Are you OK?

26:17.157 --> 26:18.181
Yeah.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.374
- Proud of you.
- Yeah.

26:21.666 --> 26:24.546
- Um, do I look OK?
- Yeah. Do I?

26:25.298 --> 26:27.887
Yeah, but it's what's inside
that counts, so...

26:27.971 --> 26:30.810
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Right.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.955
Pu? Pu?

27:02.122 --> 27:03.708
I forgot your grapes, OK?

27:03.834 --> 27:07.382
Gonna get you some purples, OK?
Purples. I'll be right back.
