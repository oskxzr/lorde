1
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:10,585
Wait, look, look.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,699
- Mr. O's underwear sticking out.
- Oh, my God!

3
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:18,877
I would like put my head in the butt part

4
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:23,094
and I would wear it on my face
as a mask to fall asleep.

5
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:25,390
All right, settle down,
settle down, people.

6
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:27,352
All right, it's Monday.
We got a lot to get through.

7
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:31,652
But first and foremost is signing up for
your mandatory community service project.

8
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:33,824
More like community suck-vice.

9
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,453
I doubt that you will be saying that

10
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:40,461
when you hear these
extremely cool options.

11
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:44,511
OK, Sam's dad is delivering
meals to the homeless.

12
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:47,225
PB&J making party at my house!

13
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:51,734
Yeah... all right.

14
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,779
There's a river trash pick up.

15
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:56,285
- You can scrape gum off the bridge.
- That one.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,249
And finally, Heather's mom...

17
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,672
is hosting a fashion show
at the nursing home. Huh?

18
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:03,884
OK, now I am so excited.

19
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:05,136
Sign up sheets are in the hallway.

20
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,597
OK, go now! Go, go, go!

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,267
Calmly! No running!

22
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:12,317
Maya Ishii-Peters, sign it!

23
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,071
No!

24
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:17,035
No, I'm getting in.
I got it, I got it, I got it.

25
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,500
Guys, guys, stop it, stop it.
It's my mom, not yours, OK? It's my mom.

26
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,089
Yes!

27
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:24,633
Personal space. Is it your mom?

28
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:26,428
- I don't think so.
- Maya, we're gonna be supermodels.

29
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:50,811
Litter and say bye to nature
as we know it.

30
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:53,524
Here. Pass this around.

31
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:55,737
She's at that group. Go ask her.

32
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:57,908
Spending time with the elderly

33
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,996
- can be so rewarding.
- Mm-hmm.

34
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,625
Whenever Heather and I
visit her grandma in the home,

35
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:04,087
I think to myself,

36
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:07,135
no one else even notices
these people besides us.

37
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,220
So true, you guys!

38
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:13,355
I mean, some of these older people
haven't been noticed in 40, 50 years.

39
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:16,028
Yeah. So let's fix that.

40
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:19,869
Now what turns heads more than a big,
beautiful hat?

41
00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:21,873
Almost nothing.

42
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:23,751
Oh, my God. That's so true. Wow!

43
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:26,215
Luckily, I have my own new line of hats...

44
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:29,847
- Deb's Darling Designs.
- Aw!

45
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,143
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

46
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:37,195
And each of you will be wearing one of
my creations as you walk the runway

47
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:40,994
with one of Franklin County's
most forgotten old people...

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,709
Hey, um, why aren't you
in your boyfriend's group?

49
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:46,797
She can't leave her best friend.

50
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:49,344
Excuse me. Can you please
go back to your own circle?

51
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,973
Go!

52
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:53,519
Anyway, as I was saying.

53
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:56,358
The actual fashion show is on Saturday...

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,195
...but we'II have
two rehearsals before that

55
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,739
to make sure you're good at modeling.

56
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:02,120
The first rehearsal is tomorrow afternoon.

57
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:04,249
Heather, don't speak over me, sweetie.

58
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,380
So, please. This is essential.

59
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:10,636
Bring a professional photo
of yourself to the rehearsal.

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,557
Headshots at the mall after school

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,269
- so we get the best hats.
- Yay!

62
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:18,235
So where... where are you guys
meeting at the...

63
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,740
Should we meet at the Orange Julius?
Or like...

64
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:23,537
Oh, we actually already have reservations.

65
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,999
Cool, so do we so...

66
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:27,045
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I know we can't come either.

67
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:28,088
It's fine.

68
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:32,013
- Well, bye, you guys. Whatever.
- Bye, see you guys tomorrow.

69
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:34,100
- I have a plan.
- OK, what?

70
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:36,396
There's a spot right near my house

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,402
and I feel like our pictures
will look exactly like theirs.

72
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:41,198
- Promise?
- I pinky promise.

73
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:43,535
So... what's the plan?

74
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:45,958
Oh, you are still here?

75
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:51,970
Oh, my gosh, I knew yours
was gonna be beautiful. Great.

76
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,432
Oh, so nice. And you know, tomorrow,

77
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:57,815
our next rehearsal,
you'll be meeting your mature partners!

78
00:03:57,898 --> 00:03:59,359
Won't that be fun?

79
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:02,198
Jeez!

80
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:07,792
OK... These photos are just incredible.
So beautiful.

81
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:11,133
The zig-zaggy part is so cute
and so is your eye shadow.

82
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,137
- Oh, my God, you guys.
- Oh, my God.

83
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,978
I think your mothers
knew what they were doing,

84
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:18,605
they got you dressed up.

85
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:22,071
Oh, my God! That lip-shade!

86
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:24,159
- Can I borrow that?
- Yes!

87
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,258
Anna, you look so pretty!

88
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,012
Aw. Thanks.

89
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,478
Huh.

90
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,695
Anna, what... what?
I don't know what that is in your photo.

91
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,741
- That's a fan
- It's a fan.

92
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:48,165
OK, you know normally if you want
that kind of the airbrush look,

93
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:49,835
you don't keep the fan in.

94
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,630
Um, thank you for the note.

95
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,467
I don't know what you're doing here, Maya.

96
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,763
You know, you almost
look like you were missing

97
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:57,683
and I know you're not
because you're right there.

98
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:58,769
But I wouldn't even put that.

99
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:00,648
Honestly I wouldn't even put that
on a milk carton.

100
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:01,901
Thank you for the note.

101
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,739
So, Terra, you know,
she looks like she's from the 1800s.

102
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:08,539
But it's on modern paper
and that... that matters.

103
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:10,793
I found that dress in the river.

104
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,092
OK, so let's go try out our outfits.

105
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,344
OK? Yay!

106
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:18,267
I can basically see my reflection
in your lip-gloss.

107
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,729
- You look so cute!
- So shiny!

108
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:23,277
Oh, my God!

109
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,947
- Do you have any lip-gloss?
- What?

110
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,285
Thanks for letting me borrow these shoes,
Heather Feather.

111
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,579
Duh, babe.

112
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,589
- Oh, my God!
- What?

113
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,555
- Heather's wearing a thong.
- Oh, my God, no way.

114
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,515
Yeah.

115
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:41,856
Do I recognize that pink top,
Miss Rebecca?

116
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:44,027
Um, yeah, Heather let me borrow it.

117
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,870
Um, Heather do you have a pink tank
that I could borrow?

118
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:50,206
Because I lost mine.

119
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,965
Um... I'm sorry I'm not really allowed to
let people borrow my clothes.

120
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:56,301
You know, sometimes people lose them.

121
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:59,557
That's cool like we can buy some
'cause we have...

122
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,228
- Money.
- Money.

123
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,146
Yeah.

124
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,732
OK, you three...

125
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,736
can... can you come over here
for a second, doll?

126
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,991
- You three...
- Yeah?

127
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:12,792
OK can you, um, look more like
the other girls with your outfits?

128
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:14,420
You know because I'd like
the outfits to be

129
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:16,591
more uniform to match the hats.

130
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:17,635
Uh-huh.

131
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,349
My hats can do a lot of work
but they can't, you know, do everything.

132
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:23,397
So, can we jus... There we go.
Like, just... yeah.

133
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,027
- Like this?
- You know, back, back, back,

134
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:26,988
there we go.

135
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:30,077
- Jess, you got the best hat.
- Oh, thank you,

136
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:31,746
but Heather definitely got the best hat.

137
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:33,625
It is quite flattering for me.

138
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,629
- It's just so... oh, so amazing.
- Your hat, like,

139
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:36,590
- match matched your hair.
- So cute.

140
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:39,596
Guys, do you want to see
my grandma's room?

141
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:41,641
- Duh, yes!
- Oh, my God!

142
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:46,359
There's actually, like, not enough room
for everyone so...

143
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,904
Um...

144
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:51,829
Ooh, how about raise your hand
if you've been to Heather's house before?

145
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,123
That's who can come.

146
00:06:57,757 --> 00:06:58,675
When?

147
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:00,889
Girl Scouts in second grade.

148
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,224
Follow me, guys.

149
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:07,903
- Great idea, Becca.
- Thanks. I know, right?

150
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,781
Your hat matched your hair.

151
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,008
What?

152
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:22,306
Look in there.

153
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:28,235
- Oh, my God. I know.
- This is what they were using.

154
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,010
No!

155
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:51,656
Oh... my...

156
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:56,416
- Wait. Why did she take that off?
- I don't know.

157
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,712
Wait, I dare you to try it on.

158
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:03,513
What? I dare you.

159
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,060
I triple dog dare you.

160
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:11,654
- Yeah!
- This is... Oh, my God!

161
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:12,991
- Wait.
- Shh!

162
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:14,995
I can't say no to a triple dog dare.
I can do it.

163
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:17,625
Wait, block me.

164
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:21,967
- Oh, my...
- Put it on, put it on.

165
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:23,971
Put it on, put it on.

166
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:26,684
Oh, my God! How does it feel?

167
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:29,106
- Crazy.
- My God. Let me see. Turn around.

168
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,158
- Wait, I wanna try it on!
- Ow!

169
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:36,079
Wait, I wanna try it on.
Let me try it on.

170
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:39,043
- Stop. Stop.
- No, I wanna try it. Let me!

171
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,339
- Oh, my God!
- Heather, stop!

172
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:44,178
Put your pants on.

173
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,558
Someone's coming here...

174
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,272
Put your pants on.

175
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:50,649
- Stop moving.
- Stop.

176
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:53,154
Stop.

177
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:54,782
Good one, Heather.

178
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,918
Your mom's honking outside.

179
00:09:00,002 --> 00:09:01,337
- OK.
- Thanks, Becca.

180
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:03,758
- You're welcome.
- Wait, Anna, Anna, Anna.

181
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:06,639
Why are your pants off?

182
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:08,560
- They weren't.
- They weren't.

183
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:13,778
- Oh, here, that was so fun.
- Yeah.

184
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:15,657
I had a great time.

185
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:17,202
OK.

186
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,757
See you tomorrow.

187
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:33,777
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- I can't believe that happened.

188
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:35,949
I didn't mean to steal.
I'm gonna give back to her tomorrow

189
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:37,242
- after I wash it. Yeah.
- No, no, no.

190
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,664
- No, that's not fair.
- What do you mean?

191
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,793
You got to try it on and I didn't it.

192
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:43,713
Fine, you can have it. It's on you then.

193
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:45,175
- OK, fine.
- OK, then good.

194
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,221
Give it... give it...
Give it to me in the car.

195
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:48,808
I will, it hurts. Have fun.

196
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,185
Hi, girls.

197
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:51,897
How did the community service go?

198
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:54,568
I don't know, we learn stuff, Mom, like...

199
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:55,905
All right.

200
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:58,576
- Seatbelt, girls.
- OK

201
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,038
- Let's just drive.
- OK.

202
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:01,374
Maya...

203
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,557
I'm washing my hands for a while
so no one bother me.

204
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:26,252
One, two, three.

205
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:29,008
Freak!

206
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:34,895
Damn, white lady.

207
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,534
- Yo
- <i>Hi, Shuji, is Maya there please?</i>

208
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,786
Bitch here she be.

209
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,586
Woah, you sound different. Um...

210
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:51,970
<i>Anyways, I was just thinking I'm just,
like, feeling a little, like, guilty.</i>

211
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,935
<i>- Are you feeling the same thing?</i>
- Yes, bothering me a lot.

212
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,064
You know, I just want to make sure
that you wash it

213
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,777
<i>and that we give it back to her,
like, put it in her bag tomorrow.</i>

214
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:03,701
Uh-huh. For sure, washing it right now.

215
00:12:04,662 --> 00:12:06,791
<i>We're just not
that kind of people, like...</i>

216
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,419
<i>we won't take something
on purpose, you know.</i>

217
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,092
Bye!

218
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:14,431
Bye!

219
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,820
Hey.

220
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:42,947
Hey.

221
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:46,120
You notice anything different about me?

222
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,166
Baby got back.

223
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:50,337
You still have... Are you serious?

224
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,424
- Maya, no.
- What?

225
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:55,013
You promised
that we give it back, like, stop.

226
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:58,269
Right, you seriously need to chill
'cause I'm gonna give it back tomorrow.

227
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,025
Like, nine people have looked at my butt
and my boobs for some reason

228
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:03,906
and I've literally only been here
for ten minutes.

229
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:05,367
Nine.

230
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,371
Hey, bowl cut.

231
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,957
I mean Maya.

232
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,752
Don't look at me.

233
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:13,299
Ten.

234
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:17,140
OK, you got checked out ten times.
Like I do... I do, too.

235
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:18,101
Like...

236
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:21,690
- Oh, Alex, look.
- Oh, shit.

237
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:27,702
- I need it.
- What?

238
00:13:27,786 --> 00:13:29,498
It, it, it.

239
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:31,210
- Anna.
- Maya.

240
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,339
- What? No.
- Give it to me.

241
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:36,011
Give me the... Give me the thing.

242
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,288
Hey.

243
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:57,137
Let's make love.

244
00:13:57,805 --> 00:13:59,851
I do it all the time.

245
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,046
What happened to your neck?

246
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:18,554
OK, I'm sorry. OK.

247
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:20,475
She almost caught us.

248
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:30,662
So, now that you've met
your Fashion Show partners,

249
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:35,463
it's important between now
and Saturday to really bond, OK?

250
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:40,265
So turn to your partner and ask
if you are a hat what kind would you be?

251
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,935
I don't really wear hats.

252
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:44,356
Oh, Heather, you're so pretty,

253
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:47,153
if I were a hat I'd be you.

254
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:50,743
- You make my hair flat.
- Oh, your hair is beautiful.

255
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:53,040
- Your hair is beautiful.
- No, it's not.

256
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:54,751
I literally already love you.

257
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,965
I'm not kidding.

258
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,013
- You're not? Wow.
- No.

259
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:01,850
Chew, chew.

260
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:09,614
If I were a hat I would be of...
a kind of like...

261
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,622
- Oh, my God.
- We could get...

262
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,626
I'll give you... I'll give you a manicure.

263
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:18,132
- OK.
- You give me a foot massage.

264
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:19,634
OK... now?

265
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:29,446
Can... can... Hel... Can
you... Can you let go?

266
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,949
You're hurting me.

267
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:35,458
Pu, let go. Let go, Pu.

268
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,800
Pu diddly Pu, Pu diddly Pu, let go, yeah?

269
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:48,317
Heath, are you OK?

270
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:50,279
Yeah, I'm fine I just...

271
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:55,498
lost something.
My mom is going to kill me.

272
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,920
Maybe one of us took it home accidentally.

273
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:03,347
- What is it?
- Um... it-it's private, you guys.

274
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:07,188
I can't really tell you,
but it's... it's pink.

275
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,190
OK.

276
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:09,986
- Let's look for it.
- That's all we need to know.

277
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,240
OK, that's a good start.

278
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:14,369
Look, don't worry.

279
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:15,998
- Can I look in your bag?
- Yeah.

280
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:20,381
Pink?

281
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:22,887
- Anna, why aren't you looking?
- I am.

282
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,518
Someone took it by accident,
it's just really important.

283
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,813
Look in your bag.

284
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:30,944
I literally looked everywhere,
you guys. I'm freaking out.

285
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:35,203
<i>Oh, my God,
I feel so bad for Heather.</i>

286
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,207
I mean, like, we should
definitely give it back.

287
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,169
<i>Like tonight or like...</i>

288
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,135
- Tomorrow, yeah.
- <i>Tomorrow, yeah.</i>

289
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,391
- Tomorrow.
- <i>Tomorrow.</i>

290
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,044
- Tomorrow
- Seriously, Anna...

291
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,967
give it to me between classes
I'm gonna give it to her.

292
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:05,596
Such a hypocrite!

293
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:17,830
Tomorrow.

294
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:22,630
Tomorrow.

295
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,013
Hi, Anna.

296
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,295
- Tomorrow.
- What?

297
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:45,844
Twenty. 25, 30, I have thirty.
Thirty, 35, 40, I have forty.

298
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:46,888
I have forty.

299
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:49,977
My tallies are through the roof.
My gel pen is basically out of gel.

300
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:51,898
- So, listen to me.
- I'm listening.

301
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:54,402
- OK, so we have the thing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

302
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:56,615
- We gotta give it back.
- We gotta give it back.

303
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,706
Tomorrow...

304
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,504
- So. To...
- After the...

305
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:05,633
- After the show.
- ...the show.

306
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:07,303
- After the show.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. After the show.

307
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:08,305
- After the show.
- We are on the same page.

308
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:09,307
We'll give it back after the show.

309
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:11,061
- OK, great.
- After the fashion show.

310
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:13,148
- Yeah.
- Who has show dips?

311
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:17,615
There, let's...

312
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:20,413
- It's only fair rock, paper, scissor.
- OK. I don't care.

313
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,083
On 15, go.

314
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,401
Oh, my God.

315
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,369
OK, ladies, listen up.

316
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,042
We don't have much time before the show

317
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,964
but as you know
something of Heather's was stolen.

318
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:47,050
A thong.

319
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,014
Please call it underwear, mom.

320
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:51,183
Shut up, sweetie.

321
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:53,938
Everybody, stand up
and get in a circle please.

322
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:56,651
And whoever took Heather's thong

323
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,948
is going to put it in the middle
of the table

324
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:03,290
and no one will know
because we're going to just turn around,

325
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:07,673
close our eyes and hum
on the count of three. OK?

326
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,385
One, two, three.

327
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:27,171
OK, open your eyes.

328
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:32,933
- Yeah, yeah, you guys.
- Really?

329
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:34,734
- Gone.
- OK, I see.

330
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,523
No one giving back.
OK. OK.

331
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:38,735
Well, I don't have time for this shit.

332
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:40,614
I have to take care of the elderly.

333
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:43,997
So, Heather, you're gonna just have
to wear the panties you have on.

334
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:49,382
Guys, seriously, this isn't funny anymore.
Like, if someone took Heather's thong,

335
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:51,636
- just say so.
- Yeah, you guys...

336
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:54,642
It must have been Anna, Maya or Terra.

337
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:56,646
- What?
- What?

338
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,860
The Bible says no thongs.

339
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:00,571
Anna and Maya,
you guys were in the changing room

340
00:20:00,654 --> 00:20:02,910
when all of us went to see
Grandma Mary's room on Monday.

341
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,164
That's probably when you stole it,
just admit it.

342
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,420
- That's insane, you're literally crazy.
- What?

343
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:09,505
Show me your underwear.

344
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:12,720
- OK, show you our underwear?
- Show me just the top.

345
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:13,890
Are you crazy?

346
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:16,269
- Oh, Maya, show her your underwear.
- OK, show your underwear.

347
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:17,898
Show me your underwear.

348
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:21,738
You guys, you guys, you guys,
this is getting really out of hand.

349
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:23,492
I agree and you're perverted.

350
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:26,122
Can we just let it go, Becca?

351
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,882
Let's do the show, let's do the show,
I'm really... I'm really sorry.

352
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:32,385
I'm sorry you lost it.

353
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:34,138
Do you guys remember it's about the hats?

354
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:43,240
Hello, welcome to the Hat Extravaganza.

355
00:20:43,782 --> 00:20:45,452
Thank you so much for coming.

356
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,085
I realized a lot of you were already here
so thank you for leaving your rooms.

357
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,968
Also I'd like to thank my pals from my
book club/wine club for being here.

358
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,180
<i>So, please just enjoy yourself.</i>

359
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:57,643
OK, here we go, let's get crazy.

360
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,499
Liar!

361
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:41,731
- She's gonna pull your pants down.
- Who?

362
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:44,237
Becca...
Becca's gonna pull your pants down.

363
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:02,273
Oh, no, no, no, stop it.
What's wrong with you? Come with me.

364
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:03,275
Come with me.

365
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,797
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we got away with it.

366
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:16,509
Oh, my God.

367
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:17,846
Oh, my God. We got away with it, Anna.

368
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,056
What are you talking about,
we got away with it?

369
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,352
I was embarrassed in front
of the entire retirement community.

370
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:22,771
- Oh, my God!
- Take off the thong. We don't need it.

371
00:22:22,856 --> 00:22:26,279
- No. I'm keeping it.
- "No"?

372
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:28,533
- Anna, stop it, stop it.
- Take it off, take it off.

373
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:30,662
- Anna, stop it. You're gonna break it.
- We're not stealers. We're not stealers.

374
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:32,541
Stop!

375
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:34,086
Stop!

376
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,797
No!

377
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:39,555
Are you seriously serious?

378
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:42,061
You, like, burned my asshole.

379
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:43,940
I'm freaking seriously dead serious

380
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:46,444
'cause that thing
was ripping everybody apart.

381
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,659
You literally just, like, ruined my life!

382
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,706
That thong ruined you.

383
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,258
- Damn it.
- And my vagina.

384
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:04,188
I have to say sometimes things just don't
turn out like you planned them, right?

385
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:06,359
And I apologize for that.

386
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:08,697
You should be apologizing to me.

387
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:13,916
I literally can't talk to you right now
when you have an attitude like that.

388
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:22,349
Pu, can you please tell Anna that I'm not
speaking to her either right now?

389
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:25,982
Um, Pu...

390
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:30,992
can you please tell Maya that sometimes
you have to right your wrongs in life

391
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:34,290
or karma will get you which is
exactly what happened to me today?

392
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:35,960
- Thank you very much.
- You know what, Pu,

393
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:39,216
you please tell Anna
that I'd like a karma to run me over

394
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:40,887
because she destroyed the one thing

395
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,183
that actually made me feel pretty
like a normal human.

396
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:45,604
- But you're pretty now.
- No, I am not.

397
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:48,944
What is this thing? I mean I want one.

398
00:23:48,986 --> 00:23:51,157
- We can't talk about it.
- You know, it's like pink...

399
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:56,459
and it like, it's like,
it has, it's like a stretchy.

400
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,544
It wasn't ours.

401
00:23:57,628 --> 00:23:59,966
Yeah, but when it was,
it was really amazing.

402
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:02,596
- See, you're overreacting right now.
- No, I'm not.

403
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,350
- Truly... Tru... Maya...
- Anna...

404
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:08,024
Truly your reaction is telling me
that it's good that we destroyed it.

405
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:10,737
That is literally the most messed up thing
you could ever say

406
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:13,159
because you weren't
ugliest girl in school, OK?

407
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:17,167
No, no, no, no, no, no, not to be corny,
but I gotta say this...

408
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:20,006
All my life I would grow a year older

409
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:22,052
look back and think
I was prettier the year before

410
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:25,517
I never got to enjoy my beauty

411
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:28,690
but I kept obsessing over it all the time.

412
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:34,243
I wish someone had told me when
I was younger that I was beautiful

413
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:38,501
because of who I <i>was</i> not what I had.

414
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:48,772
Is she choking?

415
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,951
"I... am... beautiful."

416
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,955
She's saying "I'm beautiful

417
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,297
and I don't need things on my body

418
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,092
to make me feel beautiful."

419
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,265
- You got that from that?
- Yeah.

420
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:07,684
Wow.

421
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:14,156
How's everybody holding up? Pu?

422
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:17,663
Something magical just happened.

423
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,303
OK, Pu, stop it.

424
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,560
I get it! OK? Let go.

425
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,940
You know what to do.

426
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:43,214
- Maya?
- What?

427
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:02,252
I'm not abandoning you.
I'm just letting you go

428
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:07,972
and you're gonna be loved
just like I... love you.

429
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:09,516
Bye.

430
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:11,646
Bye.

431
00:26:14,318 --> 00:26:15,362
OK, let's go.

432
00:26:15,445 --> 00:26:17,115
- Let's go.
- Are you OK?

433
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:18,181
Yeah.

434
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,374
- Proud of you.
- Yeah.

435
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,546
- Um, do I look OK?
- Yeah. Do I?

436
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:27,887
Yeah, but it's what's inside
that counts, so...

437
00:26:27,971 --> 00:26:30,810
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Right.

438
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,955
Pu? Pu?

439
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,708
I forgot your grapes, OK?

440
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:07,382
Gonna get you some purples, OK?
Purples. I'll be right back.
