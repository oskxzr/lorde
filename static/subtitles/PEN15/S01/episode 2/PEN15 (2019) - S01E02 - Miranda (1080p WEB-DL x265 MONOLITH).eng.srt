1
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:11,554
<i>Jonathan... where have you been?</i>

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,433
<i>Bethany, I have to talk to you.</i>

3
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:15,729
<i>I asked you to come meet me,</i>

4
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:18,401
<i>because I got you a milkshake,
and now it is warm.</i>

5
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:19,653
<i>You suck that down now.</i>

6
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:22,952
<i>I told you, Beth,
no more milkshakes.</i>

7
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:25,248
<i>Why, you love my strawberry milkshake?</i>

8
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:28,129
<i>Get right into my face,
and I wanna tell you...</i>

9
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,133
<i>- That you wanna suck my shake?
- No.</i>

10
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:32,429
<i>- That I can't do this anymore.
- What?</i>

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,728
<i>I have a wife and kids at home.</i>

12
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:38,274
<i>And I got a husband
and two bitch kids,</i>

13
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:40,403
<i>and I don't care! I miss you!</i>

14
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:42,032
Hold on.

15
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:43,409
Can you do that later?

16
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:45,915
- Ugh!
- OK.

17
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:47,794
<i>How dare you do this to me, bitch?</i>

18
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:49,338
<i>If you call me that one more time,</i>

19
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:50,673
<i>I swear to God I'm gonna hit you.</i>

20
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,677
<i>No, we're too good together.</i>

21
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:53,931
<i>Don't go to that love.</i>

22
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:55,141
<i>What is going on here?</i>

23
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:57,604
<i>You know what, Frank,
I've had it up to here. OK?</i>

24
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,070
- 'Na...
- Yeah?

25
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:02,865
Can we, like, never not do this?

26
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:03,992
Duh.

27
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:08,125
No, it's me, like,
I wanna Sylvanian till we're, like, old.

28
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,547
I wanna do it always.
Like, every Friday night.

29
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,425
I thought you loved me.

30
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,012
I did, and I don't anymore.

31
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:16,183
Why do they change so quick?

32
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:40,941
I tell you. Barb has been skimping
on the beans lately.

33
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:42,319
She's lagging.

34
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:45,408
- Uh, Mai...
- Anna.

35
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:49,374
Can you get something out of my backpack?

36
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,838
Ah, it's, like, so annoying, Anna.

37
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,925
Well, fine, don't get it.
I'll get it then.

38
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,180
- No.
- I'll get my hands all over my...

39
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,647
No.

40
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:02,735
Are you serious?

41
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:06,868
Hell to the 'Na! No! Are you serious?

42
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,749
Oh, my God!
This is Sylvanian Family Hamburger Wagon!

43
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:12,253
And like, I've been literally looking
for this forever!

44
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:13,255
I know.

45
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:14,675
We should definitely do this tonight.

46
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,178
Oh, my God, yes!

47
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,681
<i>Beth, we've talked about this.</i>

48
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,351
<i>I've talked about it endlessly to you.</i>

49
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:21,271
<i>We are eating in public tonight.</i>

50
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:23,735
<i>I don't care.
I want French fries in my mouth</i>

51
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,405
<i>while you suck on them, too.</i>

52
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:26,657
Why do you have dolls?

53
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:30,206
We don't. These this...

54
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:31,710
These that?

55
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,671
- That's not a doll.
- That, no.

56
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,759
- That's investment from eBay.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:36,761
Looks like a doll.

58
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:39,851
You're playing with them tonight,
and everyone knows it. OK?

59
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:44,067
OK, Gabe. Like What? What are you,
the smartest man on the living Earth?

60
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:45,278
Yes, we are playing with them,

61
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,407
'cause they're collector items,
so why do you care?

62
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,371
Collectors' item means that you just
kinda put 'em on display.

63
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:51,540
OK.

64
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,127
Lady, you're 13.

65
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,379
And?

66
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,091
And you're still playing with dolls.

67
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,306
Um, I saw you with a G.I. Joe last week.

68
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,893
They're ripped, OK?

69
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:03,230
OK, but you're admitting
that you play with them?

70
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:05,443
I have G.I. Joes,
but I don't play with them.

71
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:06,612
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

72
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:09,076
<i>I'm Sam.
I don't think I play with G.I. Joes.</i>

73
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,497
Shut up!

74
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:19,596
Shut up!

75
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,558
Shut up! Hey, everybody!

76
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:24,648
Oh, my God, what's in that box,
Maya and Anna?

77
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:26,485
- Are you guys playing with dolls?
- Stop it.

78
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:29,282
Maya and Anna have a box full of dolls
that they're playing with tonight.

79
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,744
- They do. Oh, my God!
- Yeah, yeah, they are.

80
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:32,288
Oh, my God, stop!

81
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,584
- Let's go.
- And Maya, what's in there?

82
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:35,921
Asshole.

83
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:38,259
- Bye!
- Bye!

84
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:45,523
You wanna do Sylvanian still tonight or...

85
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:48,947
I mean, yeah, I bought it.

86
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,366
Yeah.

87
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:54,750
Yeah, I'm really, like, do it
every Friday night since we were six.

88
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:58,048
- I like one...
- You're such a slut.

89
00:03:58,132 --> 00:03:59,844
So what's the plan?

90
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:02,307
Uh, my brother was gonna pick up
some herb for us for tonight.

91
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,935
Ooh! Who's got it? Charney?

92
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,315
Yeah. Oh, my God! Relax, slut.

93
00:04:06,398 --> 00:04:10,323
Also Kyle was talking about, like,
maybe hanging tonight.

94
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:11,951
Only if he brings his older brothers.

95
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,497
I like love Kyle Field.

96
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:15,709
I thought you loved Brett Field.

97
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:18,047
No, I like him,
and I like every other Field bro, too.

98
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,221
Wait, who is that?

99
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,228
Do you guys have a lighter?

100
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,858
I left it in my desk.

101
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:29,569
Totally chill, no worries.

102
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,073
- Found it!
- Oh, give me.

103
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:34,705
- Ah, shh.
- Shit. Can you guys get that?

104
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:39,422
- Shit, run, run, run!
- What's going on here?

105
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:43,807
I still see feet.

106
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,061
Sorry, we're just eating our lunch.

107
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,188
In here?

108
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:48,649
Everything OK?

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,081
That's not ours, we swear on our life.

110
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:57,417
Yeah, it's not ours.

111
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,675
Um, lessons get learned through choices.

112
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,603
And that's why I'm going to have you
throw that away instead of me. OK?

113
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,024
Thank you.

114
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:23,720
Your brother's picking us up?

115
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:26,099
Oh, my gosh, he's like so hot.

116
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:27,643
Yeah.

117
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,441
Ooh, shut the fuck up, slut!

118
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,570
Oh, my gosh, chillax, Miranda.

119
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:36,746
Hey, ladies, I just want to apologize...

120
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,415
Shut the fuck up, slut!

121
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:40,336
- OK.
- Leave.

122
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,845
There you are, girls. OK. Let's go.

123
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:48,102
Mom, what are you doing? As you remember,
at school, never get out of the car.

124
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,479
And why are wearing that tank top?

125
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,691
Are you kidding,
like with your breasts out?

126
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:59,290
Be a bad, bad boy.

127
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:01,461
- Hey...
- You're a bad, bad, bad boy!

128
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:03,215
<i>My parents aren't home,</i>

129
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,929
<i>and I just need someone to watch me.</i>

130
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,515
<i>I don't know where they went.</i>

131
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,229
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

132
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:13,026
Maya, they're trying to...
he's trying to talk to you guys.

133
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,030
No, I know. He's just busy right now.
Hold on.

134
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,036
All right, this is super fun, like...

135
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,416
I'll just fricking play by myself.

136
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:26,178
It was, like, your idea to play this,
so like...

137
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,100
Sorry. I thought you, like,
still wanted to. I don't know.

138
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,448
Let's just, like, so something else.
I don't know.

139
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:37,492
OK, fine.

140
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,541
- Alex!
- <i>'Sup!</i>

141
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,007
You've been, like, ignoring me
for three days.

142
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,969
We are married. You can't do that anymore.

143
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,430
It's not like middle school.

144
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:49,892
<i>I'm sorry, babe.</i>

145
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,108
No, sorry is not enough, like...

146
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:56,363
OK, they need to like, make up now?

147
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:59,118
Babe, we were just getting into it.
What are you doing?

148
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:01,373
- I don't know. I'm just like...
- Bored?

149
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:03,210
Maybe.

150
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:06,132
- Yeah.
- Again, like...

151
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,057
- Let's just do something else.
- OK, fine.

152
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,940
I'm trying to like...

153
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:41,328
<i>Don't hog it all
chubs butt, like, I want it.</i>

154
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:45,837
<i>- Give it to me like...

155
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,304
Wait. Who're you calling?

156
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,433
Shh.

157
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,520
<i>- Hello.

<i>It's Miranda Harris.</i>

161
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,000
<i>OK...</i>

162
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,718
<i>Hello?</i>

163
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,475
<i>I was wondering if you had any salami,</i>

164
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:16,523
<i>'cause I'm trying to make a sandwich.</i>

165
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,318
- Sandwich?
- <i>Hello?</i>

166
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,332
<i>Sorry about that. I just had to...</i>

00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,350
<i>- and I just...</i>
- Shh. Stop it! 'Na!

170
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:36,271
- You're a bitch!
- You are.

171
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:40,070
Oh, my God, I have an idea!

172
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,456
<i>I'm hot!</i>

173

<i>- So much sluttier.

00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,426

175
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:53,430

176
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:54,975
I like Kyle.

177
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,321
<i>Kyle, I can't wait to fuck you,
'cause I'm in no hurry for marriage.</i>

178
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:03,700
Ah, you just fully copied me like...

00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:06,456
Wait.

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,801
<i>We should, like, totally smoke this.</i>

181
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,888
<i>It'd be so chill.</i>

182
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,599
Yeah, it'd be chill.

183
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,021
I'm just not, like, 100% sure
that I'm ready to be a smoker.

184
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:19,942
No, no, of course. Like...

185
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:23,406
I'm not gonna do without you,
'cause we do everything together.

186
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,952
- Together, yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:09:25,494 --> 00:09:27,665
<i>Like, maybe we should,
get like a lighter.</i>

188
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:30,087
<i>To, like, play better, you know.</i>

189
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:33,677
- Hey, Dad.

190
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,391
Hey, you guys, you look festive.

191
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:39,021

198
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,129

201
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:54,928
- See ya.
- OK, bye.

202
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,934
Uh, where are your lighters?

203
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:00,773
Oh.

204
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,783
So, I think I want, like, four of them.

205
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:07,913
Or is that too many?

206
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,083
- What's up!
- I'm gonna...

207
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,171
- Here with your mom?
- I'm just gonna, like, check to see

208
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,131
if they work.

209
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:16,220
We're here alone, bitch. JK.
But we're really here alone.

210
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:19,226
Should I do, like, three, or do I do four?

211
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,270
- Anna?
- What?

212
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,149
Anna, do I do three or do I do four?

213
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:23,693
Just however many people
get usually.

214
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,782
- So... two?
- Two.

215
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,534
- Yeah, two. We'll just, like, do two.
- We'll just do two.

216
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:29,873
- Whatever, you know. Thank you.
- Thank you.

217
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:33,046
Wait, partner.

218
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,382
Oh, my God.

219
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,181
Put it away. Put it away. Put it away.
Go. Go. Go.

220
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:39,183
This way. This way.

221
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:44,652
- He like, literally thought we were...
- Wait. Which one do you think...

222
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:46,239
No, wait.
Oh, my God! 'Na!

223
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:47,993
- Look. Oh, my God!
- What?

224
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,249
That's Miranda's brother's car.

225
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:52,836
Oh!

226
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,798
What?

227
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:56,009
Wait.

228
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,054
Should we spy on them?

229
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:00,810
Oh, my God, you're so creepy, you stalker.

230
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:03,314
- I'm not a stalker!
- What are you doing?

231
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:05,152
They're having a sleepover.

232
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:07,072
Let's just, like, ding dong and ditch.

233
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,995
Oh, my God, you wanna ding dong and stay.

234
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:12,416
No.

235
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:16,257
OK, fine, let's just go back
to your house then.

236
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:17,886
- OK.
- OK.

237
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,055
After you...

238
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:25,735
My God! I knew it. You wanna stay.

239
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,239
- Ah!
- No, I don't.

240
00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:30,285
- Yes, you do.

00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:32,916
- You do it.

243
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,460

245
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:38,134
Don't. Don't.

246
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:41,307
Stop! Anna, stop!

247
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:44,688
Go!

248
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:46,192
- Go!
- Who is that?

249
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:53,498
Maya?

250
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:55,920
Yo.

251
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,426
Anna?

252
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,182
She's in the bush.

253
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:05,313
Um... yo, what are you doing?

254
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:11,033
We were um... like,
just about to smoke.

255
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,498
Oh, cool. Us, too. Let's smoke.

256
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,462
Do you wanna smoke?

257
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:21,429
Yeah?

258
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:26,063
Oh, my God!

259
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,383
When are the boys coming?

260
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:43,097
Nine. Like... relax, biatch.

261
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:44,642
Like the Fields or...

262
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,646
There's five of us and five of them.

263
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:47,774
It's perfect.

264
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,153
Isn't one of them, like, eight?

265
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,157
Yeah, but he's fucking hot.

266
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,368
I wish we had herb.

267
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:54,578
Who's got the beer?

268
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:55,873
Oh.

269
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:11,112
Do you guys drink?

270
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:14,618
I need to pee.

271
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:34,158
So I'm freaking the eff out.

272
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:35,870
Who cares? People drink.

273
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:37,247
Like, it's just beer.

274
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,878
Who cares?

275
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,634
The Field brothers are so hot.

276
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,971
Wait. Wait.
Which one's the hottest one?

277
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:46,140

00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,188
It's Kyle.

280
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:52,779
Are you drinking?

281
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,660
Yeah, like, just one sip.

282
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:59,124
Without me. Cool.

283
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,504
Anna, you take a sip.

284
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:04,803
Sip! Sip! Sip!

289
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,631
You guys ever done computer cleaner?

Yeah, actually, I have... or my dad has.

291
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:29,978
He uses it for computer,
'cause it gets in all the crevices.

292
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:32,775
- Yeah.
- We are inhaling not cleaning.

293
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:35,572

294
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:37,409
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do.

295
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:39,246
I'll do it if you do it.

00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,714

306
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,783
OK, ready?

307
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,369
Inhale! Inhale!

308
00:14:59,494 --> 00:15:01,165
- Let's do it.
- Inhale! Inhale!

309
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:03,002
Inhale! Inhale!

310
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,012
When does it...

311
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,656
Oh, my God! Maya?

312
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,161
Is this normal? Maya? Maya?

313
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,040

00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:23,167

315
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:24,837
Oh, my God!

316
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,215
How long were we out for?

317
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,802
Ten seconds.

318
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:32,018
We lost our minds, you guys.
That was crazy!

319
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:34,398
Just you. We didn't do it.

320
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:36,694
- Wait, what?
- You looked so scary.

321
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:38,072
I thought you were a corpse.

322
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:39,742
Wait. You didn't do it, 'Na?

323
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:41,705
Sorry. I... I... I... I was gonna...

324
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:43,207
It's just, like,
I'm worried about my brain.

325
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,501
You promised.

326
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,881
- You are fi... you are fine.
- So messed up.

327
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,217
Guys, it's nine o'clock.

328
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:50,096
- Where are the boys?
- Wait. It's nine?

329
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,181
Can I use your phone?

330
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,768
Yeah. My brother's room.

331
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:56,860
<i>See? Now you try.</i>

332
00:16:02,203 --> 00:16:03,289

May I use your phone, please?

335
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:13,769
Right in front of you... the boat.

336
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:17,442
Oh.

337
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,953
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Mama.

338
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:25,416
- <i>Is everything OK?</i>
- Yeah. We're just...

339
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,089
We are about to go to bed,
so I just wanted to say good night.

340
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,301
- <i>OK, I hear something.</i>

341
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:34,226
Um, it's just... it's a movie Anna rented.

00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:36,146
We're just... yeah.

343

<i>Oyasumi.</i>

347
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,458
<i>Fun, real fun.</i>

348
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,003
Thank you. Good-bye.

349
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,883
My mom's not home, so...

350
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,552
Cool.

351
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:42,111
Uh... Stevie.

352
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:49,125
Charney I guess.

353
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,378
Sick.

354
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:00,273
You.

355
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:01,358
Yes!

356
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,163
The... the tall one.

357
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,947
Do you need help with that?

358
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:26,199
Got it.

359
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:31,335
Wait.

360
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:39,267
What do you want?

361
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:41,981
Um, all the good spots are taken.

362
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:45,363
Well, we can't do
everything together, so...

363
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,516
You ever play Crash Bandicoot?

364
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:03,942
What?

365
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:09,577
- You gonna do it?
- OK.

366
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:15,631
Wait. Mm-hmm.

367
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,399
OK.

368
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:27,030
This is what I look like without it.

369
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:31,121
We've just done everything together
since, like, '93.

370
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,754
And then all of a sudden, it's, like,
everything can just change

371
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:37,467
in, like, a flip or an instant.

372
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,262
I know exactly what you mean.

373
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,772
My grandmother... died last year.

374
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:47,195
Then you probably know exactly how I feel.

375
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:49,240
I mean, I... I think so.

376
00:19:58,175 --> 00:19:59,177
Dragon.

377
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:01,098
I don't know how long
you've known your grandma.

378
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:04,646
I've known Maya...
literally forever.

379
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:07,778
Maybe it's more or less like,

380
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,990
when my magic cards got stolen.

381
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:12,871
I thought we were on the same page,
but like...

382
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:14,959
You lost me.

383
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:17,756
Wait, look...

384
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,473
I'm a scarecrow.

385
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:24,310
What?

386
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:29,279
Like, if you don't wanna hook up,
that's fine. I mean, like...

387
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:32,535
I just thought, you know,
we're in like, you know...

388
00:20:32,828 --> 00:20:35,541
Oh, just fricking start with a kiss.

389
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:39,674
You're gonna come in right now?

390
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:41,011
Uh-huh.

391
00:20:41,303 --> 00:20:42,764
Onto my lips?

392
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,690
Hoot! Hoot!

393
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:49,694
I'm an owl now.

394
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:52,450
I'm...

395
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,204
Someone's coming.

396
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:55,164
Is that your mom?

397
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,043
What the hell is going on?

398
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,339
- Hurry.
- Take this.

399
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:01,551
- Me?
- Go. Go.

400
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,641
What's happening?

401
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:09,234
Shh. She's coming.

402
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:11,906
Hi, Mom.

403
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,450
- Hi, Ms. Harris.
- Hi, Ms. Harris.

404
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:16,456
Hi. How's your girls' night?

405
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:17,541
- Good.
- Pretty good.

406
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,545
Um, just playing cards.

407
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:26,393
What's this?

408
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:30,860
Whose beer is this?

409
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:41,589
- Did you drink this beer?
- No.

410
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:43,093
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

411
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,595
- Is that my coat?
- Ye-Yeah.

412
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:45,974
Come here. Come here.

413
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:47,853
- No.
- Let me smell your breath.

414
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:58,123
OK.

415
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,754
I'm gonna need to call your mom.

416
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:02,256
Oh, my God, my mom.

417
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:04,427
'Na...

418
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,096
Maya, what are you doing? Go to bed.

419
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,808
Just having water.

420
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:31,022
You like, yelled at me for an hour.
Give me a break.

421
00:22:31,314 --> 00:22:34,654
- OK, just drink it and go to bed. OK?
- OK.

422
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:48,640
- Anna!
- Maya!

423
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:50,812
Go away! I'm mad at you.

424
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:53,316
I want you to. That's why we need to talk.
Open the door.

425
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:54,945
Keep your voice down. No!

426
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,158
- Open the... what the fuck are you doing?
- No.

427
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,828
- Don't.
- No.

428
00:22:58,911 --> 00:22:59,872
- No!
- OK.

429
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:01,917
Whatever.

430
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,925
Gone.

431
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,766
Be quiet.

432
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,066
I got it.

433
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,049
Stop rolling your eyes, Anna.

434
00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:28,220
I'm sorry. I don't realize when I do it.

435
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:30,015
Ugh!

436
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,186
- You just hit...
- OK. Well, I didn't mean to.

437
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,146
Sorry.

438
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,456
Well, I'm just glad that you're OK, so...

439
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:43,667
Well, I'm not literally OK,

440
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:45,755
because you left me to get in trouble
by myself.

441
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,677
You're the one that said,
"We can't do everything together,"

442
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,097
when you were in the closet with that boy.

443
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,685
I only said that,
because I did you-know-what...

444
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,063
and you didn't do it with me.

445
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:56,401
- Are you serious?
- Shh! My mom!

446
00:23:56,526 --> 00:23:57,528
Oh, my God! I'm being shush...

447
00:23:57,611 --> 00:24:00,284
My mom is literally, like, right outside.
So can you please be quiet?

448
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:01,787
- Shh!
- Are you kidding me?

449
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,874
You just said "are" so loud.

450
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,377
Stop, Anna.

451
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:10,972
When I came out of the bathroom,
you were already like...

452
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:12,976
Are you serious?

453
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:15,397
<i>Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.</i>

454
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:16,399
<i>Yeah, you serious?</i>

455
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:17,944
Like, seriously, Anna,

456
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,449
you were the one that was like

457
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:22,453
Are you kidding? You did it before me.

458
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:24,498
Like, we were supposed
to have our first, like...

459
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:26,544
together.

460
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:28,381
And now that moment's gone forever.

461
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,264
What happened in the closet with that boy?

462
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:35,938
You mean, like, nothing. I swear.

463
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:40,697
Like, he wanted to hook up with me,
but I was like... no.

464
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:46,835
Did you... with your guy?

465
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,338
No, he's, like, eight.

466
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:50,592
Yeah, but he's fucking hot.

467
00:24:50,927 --> 00:24:52,096
Yeah.

468
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:58,149
I know that you're bored in pretend.

469
00:24:58,776 --> 00:25:00,070
'Na, like...

470
00:25:00,404 --> 00:25:02,199
Come on. You were bored, too,

471
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:04,120
like, don't even pretend.

472
00:25:06,624 --> 00:25:08,253
I know you're just, like, over me.

473
00:25:08,378 --> 00:25:11,467
'Na, I'm, like, obviously never over you.

474
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,140
Like, come here.

475
00:25:14,808 --> 00:25:16,102
No, I know you are.

476
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:18,273
I'm not. I swear.

477
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:20,402
Come on.

478
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:22,782
Just, like, put them on.

479
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:26,247
You bitch!

480
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,249
Slut!

481
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:34,263
I guess I'm sleeping over.

482
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,017
Oh, my God!

483
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:39,482
Oh, my God!

484
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:40,985
Should we flush it?

485
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:45,660
We could, like... still have
our first together if you want.

486
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:49,460
OK, I will... if you will I guess.

487
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:52,967
I don't know. I'm, like, still drunk.

488
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,723
Yeah, like, big decisions should be made
when we're, like, sober.

489
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:58,478
But I promise, like, when we do do it...

490
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,317
like, we'll do it together.

491
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:06,410
Wait. I wanna...

492
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:08,958
- Where you gonna...
- Up here.

493
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:14,385
- Shh!
- Shh!

494
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:54,256
Hmm.

495
00:26:56,677 --> 00:26:58,849
Hoot! Hoot! I'm an owl now.
