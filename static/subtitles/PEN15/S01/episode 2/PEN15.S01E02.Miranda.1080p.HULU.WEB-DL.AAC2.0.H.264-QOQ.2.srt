00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:10,354
<i>Jonathan... where have you been?</i>

2
00:00:10,437 --> 00:00:12,233
<i>Bethany, I have to talk to you.</i>

3
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:14,529
<i>I asked you to come meet me,</i>

4
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:17,201
<i>because I got you a milkshake,
and now it is warm.</i>

5
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,453
<i>You suck that down now.</i>

6
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:21,752
<i>I told you, Beth,
no more milkshakes.</i>

7
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:24,048
<i>Why, you love my strawberry milkshake?</i>

8
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:26,929
<i>Get right into my face,
and I wanna tell you...</i>

9
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:28,933
<i>- That you wanna suck my shake?
- No.</i>

10
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:31,229
<i>- That I can't do this anymore.
- What?</i>

11
00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:34,528
<i>I have a wife and kids at home.</i>

12
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:37,074
<i>And I got a husband
and two bitch kids,</i>

13
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:39,203
<i>and I don't care! I miss you!</i>

14
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:40,832
Hold on.

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,291
Can you do that later?

16
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:44,715
- Ugh!
- OK.

17
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:46,594
<i>How dare you do this to me, bitch?</i>

18
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:48,138
<i>If you call me that one more time,</i>

19
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:49,534
<i>I swear to God I'm gonna hit you.</i>

20
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:51,477
<i>No, we're too good together.</i>

21
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:52,731
<i>Don't go to that love.</i>

22
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:53,941
<i>What is going on here?</i>

23
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:56,404
<i>You know what, Frank,
I've had it up to here. OK?</i>

24
00:00:58,701 --> 00:00:59,870
- 'Na...
- Yeah?

25
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:01,665
Can we, like, never not do this?

26
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:02,792
Duh.

27
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:06,925
No, it's me, like,
I wanna Sylvanian till we're, like, old.

28
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:09,347
I wanna do it always.
Like, every Friday night.

29
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,225
I thought you loved me.

30
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:12,812
I did, and I don't anymore.

31
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:14,983

She's lagging.

40

- Uh, Mai...
- Anna.

41
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:48,174
Can you get something out of my backpack?

42
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:50,638
Ah, it's, like, so annoying, Anna.

43
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:52,725
Well, fine, don't get it.
I'll get it then.

47
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:05,668
Hell to the 'Na! No! Are you serious?

48
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,549
Oh, my God!
This is Sylvanian Family Hamburger Wagon!

49
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:11,053
And like, I've been literally looking
for this forever!

50
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:12,055
I know.

51
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,535
We should definitely do this tonight.

52
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,978
Oh, my God, yes!

53
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:16,481
<i>Beth, we've talked about this.</i>

54
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,151
<i>I've talked about it endlessly to you.</i>

55
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:20,071
<i>We are eating in public tonight.</i>

56
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:22,535
<i>I don't care.
I want French fries in my mouth</i>

57
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,205
<i>while you suck on them, too.</i>

58
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:25,457
Why do you have dolls?

59
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,006
We don't. These this...

60
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,549
These that?

61
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:32,471
- That's not a doll.
- That, no.

62
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:34,559
- That's investment from eBay.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:35,561
Looks like a doll.

64
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:38,651
You're playing with them tonight,
and everyone knows it. OK?

65
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:42,867
OK, Gabe. Like What? What are you,
the smartest man on the living Earth?

66
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:44,137
Yes, we are playing with them,

67
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:46,207
'cause they're collector items,
so why do you care?

68
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,171
Collectors' item means that you just
kinda put 'em on display.

69
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,340
OK.

70
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:51,927
Lady, you're 13.

71
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,179
And?

72
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:54,891
And you're still playing with dolls.

73
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:58,106
Um, I saw you with a G.I. Joe last week.

74
00:02:58,189 --> 00:02:59,693
They're ripped, OK?

75
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:02,090
OK, but you're admitting
that you play with them?

76
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:04,243
I have G.I. Joes,
but I don't play with them.

77
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,412
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

Oh, my God, what's in that box,
Maya and Anna?

88
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:25,292
- Are you guys playing with dolls?
- Stop it.

89
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:28,225
Maya and Anna have a box full of dolls
that they're playing with tonight.

90
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,604
- They do. Oh, my God!
- Yeah, yeah, they are.

91
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:31,088
Oh, my God, stop!

00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:34,721
Asshole.

00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:37,059
- Bye!
- Bye!

95
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:44,323
You wanna do Sylvanian still tonight or...

96
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:47,747
I mean, yeah, I bought it.

97
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,166
Yeah.

98
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:53,550
Yeah, I'm really, like, do it
every Friday night since we were six.

99
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,848
- I like one...
- You're such a slut.

100
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,644
So what's the plan?

101
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:01,166
Uh, my brother was gonna pick up
some herb for us for tonight.

102
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,735
Ooh! Who's got it? Charney?

103
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,115
Yeah. Oh, my God! Relax, slut.

104
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:09,123
Also Kyle was talking about, like,
maybe hanging tonight.

105
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:10,751
Only if he brings his older brothers.

106
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,297
I like love Kyle Field.

107
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:14,568
I thought you loved Brett Field.

108
00:04:14,592 --> 00:04:16,847
No, I like him,
and I like every other Field bro, too.

109
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,021
Wait, who is that?

110
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,028
Do you guys have a lighter?

111
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:26,658
I left it in my desk.

112
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:28,369
Totally chill, no worries.

113
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:29,873
- Found it!
- Oh, give me.

114
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:33,505
- Ah, shh.
- Shit. Can you guys get that?

115
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:38,222
- Shit, run, run, run!
- What's going on here?

116
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,607
I still see feet.

117
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,861
Sorry, we're just eating our lunch.

118
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:45,988
In here?

119
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:47,449
Everything OK?

120
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,881
That's not ours, we swear on our life.

121
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:56,217
Yeah, it's not ours.

122
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,475
Um, lessons get learned through choices.

123
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:06,403
And that's why I'm going to have you
throw that away instead of me. OK?

124
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:07,824
Thank you.

125
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:22,520
Your brother's picking us up?

126
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:24,899
Oh, my gosh, he's like so hot.

127
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:26,443
Yeah.

128
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:29,241
Ooh, shut the fuck up, slut!

129
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:31,370
Oh, my gosh, chillax, Miranda.

130
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,546
Hey, ladies, I just want to apologize...

131
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,215
Shut the fuck up, slut!

132
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:39,136
- OK.
- Leave.

133
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,645
There you are, girls. OK. Let's go.

134
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,902
Mom, what are you doing? As you remember,
at school, never get out of the car.

135
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,338
And why are wearing that tank top?

136
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:50,491
Are you kidding,
like with your breasts out?

137
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,090
Be a bad, bad boy.

We are married. You can't do that anymore.

I'm just not, like, 100% sure
that I'm ready to be a smoker.

196
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:18,742
No, no, of course. Like...

00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:26,465
<i>Like, maybe we should,

Oh.

00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:04,583
So, I think I want, like, four of them.

217
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,713
Or is that too many?

218
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,883
- What's up!

219
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:11,072

00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:11,931
if they work.

221
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:15,020
We're here alone, bitch. JK.
But we're really here alone.

222
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,026
Should I do, like, three, or do I do four?

223
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,070
- Anna?
- What?

224
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:20,949
Anna, do I do three or do I do four?

- Thank you.

229
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:31,846
Wait, partner.

230

Oh, my God.

231
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,981
Put it away. Put it away. Put it away.
Go. Go. Go.

232
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:38,023
This way. This way.

00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:46,793
- Look. Oh, my God!

00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:50,049
That's Miranda's brother's car.

00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:51,636
Oh!

Wait.

240
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:56,854
Should we spy on them?

241
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,610
Oh, my God, you're so creepy, you stalker.

242
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:02,114
- I'm not a stalker!
- What are you doing?

243
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:03,952
They're having a sleepover.

244
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:05,872
Let's just, like, ding dong and ditch.

245

My God! I knew it. You wanna stay.

251
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:27,039

Don't. Don't.

258
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:40,107
Stop! Anna, stop!

259
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:43,488
Go!

260
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:44,992

261
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:52,298

262
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:54,720
Yo.

263
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,226
Anna?

264
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:00,982
She's in the bush.

265
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:04,113
Um... yo, what are you doing?

266
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:09,833
We were um... like,
just about to smoke.

267

Oh, cool. Us, too. Let's smoke.

00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:24,863
Oh, my God!

00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:45,446
There's five of us and five of them.

275
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:46,613
It's perfect.

276
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,953
Isn't one of them, like, eight?

277
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:50,957
Yeah, but he's fucking hot.

278
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,168
I wish we had herb.

279
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,378
Who's got the beer?

280
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:54,713
Oh.

Who cares? People drink.

285
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:36,047
Like, it's just beer.

286
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:38,678
Who cares?

287
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:42,434
The Field brothers are so hot.

288
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,872
Wait. Wait.
Which one's the hottest one?

289

Yeah, actually, I have... or my dad has.

He uses it for computer,
'cause it gets in all the crevices.

00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:31,575

00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,169
Inhale! Inhale!

320
00:14:58,294 --> 00:14:59,965

321
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,802
Inhale! Inhale!

322
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,812
When does it...

323
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,456
Oh, my God! Maya?

324
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,961
Is this normal? Maya? Maya?

Oh, my God!

328
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:25,015
How long were we out for?

329
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,602
Ten seconds.

330
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:30,818
We lost our minds, you guys.
That was crazy!

331
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:33,198
Just you. We didn't do it.

332
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,494
- Wait, what?
- You looked so scary.

333
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:36,872
I thought you were a corpse.

334
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,542
Wait. You didn't do it, 'Na?

335
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:40,505
Sorry. I... I... I... I was gonna...

336
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:42,067
It's just, like,
I'm worried about my brain.

337
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:43,301
You promised.

338
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,681
- You are fi... you are fine.
- So messed up.

339
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:47,017
Guys, it's nine o'clock.

340
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,896
- Where are the boys?
- Wait. It's nine?

341
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:49,981
Can I use your phone?

342
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,568
Yeah. My brother's room.

343
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:55,660
<i>See? Now you try.</i>

344
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,089

347
00:16:10,898 --> 00:16:12,569
Right in front of you... the boat.

348
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:16,365
Oh.

349
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,753
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Mama.

350
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:24,216
- <i>Is everything OK?</i>
- Yeah. We're just...

351
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:26,889
We are about to go to bed,
so I just wanted to say good night.

352
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,101
- <i>OK, I hear something.</i>
- Yeah.

353
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:33,026
Um, it's just... it's a movie Anna rented.

354
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:34,946
We're just... yeah.

355
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,948
It's <i>Home Alone.</i>

356
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,990
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

357
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:38,787
<i>Be polite.</i>

358
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:40,415
<i>Oyasumi.</i>

359
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:45,258
<i>Fun, real fun.</i>

360
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,803
Thank you. Good-bye.

Got it.

389
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,174
Wait.

390
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,149
What do you want?

391
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,781
Um, all the good spots are taken.

392
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:44,163
Well, we can't do
everything together, so...

393
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:58,316
You ever play Crash Bandicoot?

394
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:02,782
What?

395
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:08,377
- You gonna do it?
- OK.

396
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:14,431
Wait. Mm-hmm.

397
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,199
OK.

398
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:25,830
This is what I look like without it.

399
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:29,921
We've just done everything together
since, like, '93.

400
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:33,554
And then all of a sudden, it's, like,
everything can just change

401
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,267
in, like, a flip or an instant.

402
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:38,062
I know exactly what you mean.

403
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,572
My grandmother... died last year.

404
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:45,995
Then you probably know exactly how I feel.

405
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:48,040
I mean, I... I think so.

406
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:57,977
Dragon.

407
00:19:58,185 --> 00:19:59,957
I don't know how long
you've known your grandma.

408
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:03,446
I've known Maya...
literally forever.

409
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:06,578
Maybe it's more or less like,

410
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,790
when my magic cards got stolen.

411
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,671
I thought we were on the same page,
but like...

412
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:13,759
You lost me.

413
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:16,556
Wait, look...

414
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,273
I'm a scarecrow.

415
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:23,110
What?

416
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,079
Like, if you don't wanna hook up,
that's fine. I mean, like...

417
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:31,335
I just thought, you know,
we're in like, you know...

418
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:34,341
Oh, just fricking start with a kiss.

419
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:38,474
You're gonna come in right now?

420
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:39,811
Uh-huh.

421
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:41,564
Onto my lips?

422
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:46,490
Hoot! Hoot!

423
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:48,494
I'm an owl now.

424
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:51,250
I'm...

425
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,004
Someone's coming.

426
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,045
Is that your mom?

427
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,843
What the hell is going on?

428
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,139
- Hurry.
- Take this.

429
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,351
- Me?
- Go. Go.

430
00:21:02,188 --> 00:21:03,441
What's happening?

431
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,034
Shh. She's coming.

432
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:10,706
Hi, Mom.

433
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:12,250
- Hi, Ms. Harris.
- Hi, Ms. Harris.

434
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:15,256
Hi. How's your girls' night?

435
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:16,341
- Good.
- Pretty good.

436
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,345
Um, just playing cards.

437
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:25,193
What's this?

438
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:29,660
Whose beer is this?

439
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:40,389
- Did you drink this beer?
- No.

440
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:41,893
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

441
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:43,395
- Is that my coat?
- Ye-Yeah.

442
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:44,774
Come here. Come here.

443
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:46,653
- No.
- Let me smell your breath.

444
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:56,923
OK.

445
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,554
I'm gonna need to call your mom.

446
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:01,056
Oh, my God, my mom.

447
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:03,227
'Na...

448
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:24,896
Maya, what are you doing? Go to bed.

449
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,608
Just having water.

450
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:29,822
You like, yelled at me for an hour.
Give me a break.

451
00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:33,454
- OK, just drink it and go to bed. OK?
- OK.

452
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:47,440
- Anna!
- Maya!

453
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:49,612
Go away! I'm mad at you.

454
00:22:49,695 --> 00:22:52,116
I want you to. That's why we need to talk.
Open the door.

455
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:53,745
Keep your voice down. No!

456
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:55,975
- Open the... what the fuck are you doing?
- No.

457
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,628
- Don't.
- No.

458
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,711
- No!
- OK.

459
00:22:59,632 --> 00:23:00,717
Whatever.

460
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,725
Gone.

461
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:08,566
Be quiet.

462
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,866
I got it.

463
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,849
Stop rolling your eyes, Anna.

464
00:23:24,974 --> 00:23:27,020
I'm sorry. I don't realize when I do it.

465
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:28,815
Ugh!

466
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,986
- You just hit...
- OK. Well, I didn't mean to.

467
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:32,111
Sorry.

468
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,256
Well, I'm just glad that you're OK, so...

469
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:42,467
Well, I'm not literally OK,

470
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,555
because you left me to get in trouble
by myself.

471
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,477
You're the one that said,
"We can't do everything together,"

472
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:48,914
when you were in the closet with that boy.

473
00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:51,485
I only said that,
because I did you-know-what...

474
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:52,863
and you didn't do it with me.

475
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:55,201
- Are you serious?
- Shh! My mom!

476
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:56,387
Oh, my God! I'm being shush...

477
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:59,131
My mom is literally, like, right outside.
So can you please be quiet?

478
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,587
- Shh!
- Are you kidding me?

479
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,674
You just said "are" so loud.

480
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,177
Stop, Anna.

481
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:09,772
When I came out of the bathroom,
you were already like...

482
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:11,776
Are you serious?

483
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,197
<i>Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.</i>

484
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:15,199
<i>Yeah, you serious?</i>

485
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:16,744
Like, seriously, Anna,

486
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,249
you were the one that was like

487
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,253
Are you kidding? You did it before me.

488
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,298
Like, we were supposed
to have our first, like...

489
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:25,344
together.

490
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:27,181
And now that moment's gone forever.

491
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,064
What happened in the closet with that boy?

492
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:34,738
You mean, like, nothing. I swear.

493
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:39,497
Like, he wanted to hook up with me,
but I was like... no.

494
00:24:42,378 --> 00:24:45,635
Did you... with your guy?

495
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,138
No, he's, like, eight.

496
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:49,392
Yeah, but he's fucking hot.

497
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:50,896
Yeah.

498
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,949
I know that you're bored in pretend.

499
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:58,870
'Na, like...

500
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:00,999
Come on. You were bored, too,

501
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,920
like, don't even pretend.

502
00:25:05,424 --> 00:25:07,053
I know you're just, like, over me.

503
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:10,267
'Na, I'm, like, obviously never over you.

504
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,940
Like, come here.

505
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:14,902
No, I know you are.

506
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:17,073
I'm not. I swear.

507
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,202
Come on.

508
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:21,582
Just, like, put them on.

509
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,047
You bitch!

510
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,130
Slut!

511
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:33,063
I guess I'm sleeping over.

512
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,817
Oh, my God!

513
00:25:36,194 --> 00:25:38,282
Oh, my God!

514
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:39,785
Should we flush it?

515
00:25:40,244 --> 00:25:44,460
We could, like... still have
our first together if you want.

516
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,260
OK, I will... if you will I guess.

517
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:51,767
I don't know. I'm, like, still drunk.

518
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,523
Yeah, like, big decisions should be made
when we're, like, sober.

519
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:57,278
But I promise, like, when we do do it...

520
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,117
like, we'll do it together.

521
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,210
Wait. I wanna...

522
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:07,758
- Where you gonna...
- Up here.

523
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:13,185
- Shh!
