00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:51,485
I only said that,
because I did you-know-what...

513
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:52,863
and you didn't do it with me.

514
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:55,201
- Are you serious?
- Shh! My mom!

515
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:56,387
Oh, my God! I'm being shush...

516
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:59,131
My mom is literally, like, right outside.
So can you please be quiet?

517
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,587
- Shh!
- Are you kidding me?

518
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,674
You just said "are" so loud.

519
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,177
Stop, Anna.

520
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:09,772
When I came out of the bathroom,
you were already like...

521
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:11,776
Are you serious?

522
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,197
[MOCKS MAYA] <i>Are you serious?</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm serious.</i>

523
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:15,199
[MOCKINGLY] <i>Yeah, you serious?</i>

524
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:16,744
Like, seriously, Anna,

525
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,249
you were the one that was like
[MOCK GAGGING].

526
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,253
Are you kidding? You did it before me.

527
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,298
Like, we were supposed
to have our first, like...

528
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:25,344
together.

529
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:27,181
And now that moment's gone forever.

530
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,064
What happened in the closet with that boy?

531
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:34,738
You mean, like, nothing. I swear.

532
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:39,497
Like, he wanted to hook up with me,
but I was like... no.

533
00:24:42,378 --> 00:24:45,635
Did you... with your guy?

534
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,138
No, he's, like, eight.

535
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:49,392
Yeah, but he's fucking hot.

536
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:50,896
Yeah.

537
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,949
I know that you're bored in pretend.

538
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:58,870
'Na, like...

539
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:00,999
Come on. You were bored, too,

540
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,920
like, don't even pretend.

541
00:25:05,424 --> 00:25:07,053
I know you're just, like, over me.

542
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:10,267
'Na, I'm, like, obviously never over you.

543
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,940
Like, come here.

544
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:14,902
No, I know you are.

545
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:17,073
[MAYA] I'm not. I swear.

546
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,202
Come on.

547
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:21,582
Just, like, put them on.

548
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,047
[SCOFFS] You bitch!

549
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,130
Slut!

550
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:33,281
[ANNA WHISPERING]
I guess I'm sleeping over.

551
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,817
Oh, my God!

552
00:25:36,194 --> 00:25:38,282
Oh, my God! [CHUCKLES]

553
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:39,785
Should we flush it?

554
00:25:40,244 --> 00:25:44,460
We could, like... still have
our first together if you want.

555
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,260
OK, I will... if you will I guess.

556
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:51,767
I don't know. I'm, like, still drunk.

557
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,523
Yeah, like, big decisions should be made
when we're, like, sober.

558
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:57,278
But I promise, like, when we do do it...

559
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,117
like, we'll do it together.

560
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,210
Wait. I wanna...

561
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:07,758
[ANA] Where you gonna...
[MAYA] Up here.

562
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:13,185
- Shh!
- Shh!

563
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:53,056
Hmm.

564
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:57,649
Hoot! Hoot! I'm an owl now.

565
00:27:01,406 --> 00:27:02,784
