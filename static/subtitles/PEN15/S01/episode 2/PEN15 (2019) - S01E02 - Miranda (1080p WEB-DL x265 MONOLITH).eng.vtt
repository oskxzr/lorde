<i>Jonathan... where have you been?</i>

00:11.637 --> 00:13.433
<i>Bethany, I have to talk to you.</i>

00:13.516 --> 00:15.729
<i>I asked you to come meet me,</i>

00:15.813 --> 00:18.401
<i>because I got you a milkshake,
and now it is warm.</i>

00:18.484 --> 00:19.653
<i>You suck that down now.</i>

00:19.738 --> 00:22.952
<i>I told you, Beth,
no more milkshakes.</i>

00:23.035 --> 00:25.248
<i>Why, you love my strawberry milkshake?</i>

00:25.331 --> 00:28.129
<i>Get right into my face,
and I wanna tell you...</i>

00:28.171 --> 00:30.133
<i>- That you wanna suck my shake?
- No.</i>

00:30.175 --> 00:32.429
<i>- That I can't do this anymore.
- What?</i>

00:32.512 --> 00:35.728
<i>I have a wife and kids at home.</i>

00:35.811 --> 00:38.274
<i>And I got a husband
and two bitch kids,</i>

00:38.357 --> 00:40.403
<i>and I don't care! I miss you!</i>

00:40.487 --> 00:42.032
Hold on.

00:42.491 --> 00:43.409
Can you do that later?

00:44.536 --> 00:45.915

00:45.998 --> 00:47.794
<i>How dare you do this to me, bitch?</i>

00:47.877 --> 00:49.338
<i>If you call me that one more time,</i>

00:49.421 --> 00:50.673
<i>I swear to God I'm gonna hit you.</i>

00:50.758 --> 00:52.677
<i>No, we're too good together.</i>

00:52.762 --> 00:53.931
<i>Don't go to that love.</i>

00:54.014 --> 00:55.141
<i>What is going on here?</i>

00:55.183 --> 00:57.604
<i>You know what, Frank,
I've had it up to here. OK?</i>

00:59.901 --> 01:01.070
- 'Na...
- Yeah?

01:01.153 --> 01:02.865
Can we, like, never not do this?

01:02.949 --> 01:03.992
Duh.

01:04.076 --> 01:08.125
No, it's me, like,
I wanna Sylvanian till we're, like, old.

01:08.209 --> 01:10.547
I wanna do it always.
Like, every Friday night.

01:10.630 --> 01:12.425
I thought you loved me.

01:12.509 --> 01:14.012
I did, and I don't anymore.

01:14.096 --> 01:16.183
Why do they change so quick?

01:37.894 --> 01:40.941
I tell you. Barb has been skimping
on the beans lately.

01:41.025 --> 01:42.319
She's lagging.

01:43.154 --> 01:45.408
- Uh, Mai...
- Anna.

01:45.491 --> 01:49.374
Can you get something out of my backpack?

01:49.458 --> 01:51.838
Ah, it's, like, so annoying, Anna.

01:51.921 --> 01:53.925
Well, fine, don't get it.
I'll get it then.

01:54.009 --> 01:56.180
- No.
- I'll get my hands all over my...

01:59.729 --> 02:00.647
No.

02:01.273 --> 02:02.735
Are you serious?

02:03.152 --> 02:06.868
Hell to the 'Na! No! Are you serious?

02:06.951 --> 02:09.749
Oh, my God!
This is Sylvanian Family Hamburger Wagon!

02:09.832 --> 02:12.253
And like, I've been literally looking
for this forever!

02:12.337 --> 02:13.255
I know.

02:13.339 --> 02:14.675
We should definitely do this tonight.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.178
Oh, my God, yes!

02:16.261 --> 02:17.681
<i>Beth, we've talked about this.</i>

02:17.765 --> 02:19.351
<i>I've talked about it endlessly to you.</i>

02:19.434 --> 02:21.271
<i>We are eating in public tonight.</i>

02:21.397 --> 02:23.735
<i>I don't care.
I want French fries in my mouth</i>

02:23.819 --> 02:25.405
<i>while you suck on them, too.</i>

02:25.488 --> 02:26.657
Why do you have dolls?

02:27.575 --> 02:30.206
We don't. These this...

02:30.749 --> 02:31.710
These that?

02:31.793 --> 02:33.671
- That's not a doll.
- That, no.

02:33.755 --> 02:35.759
- That's investment from eBay.
- Yeah.

02:35.843 --> 02:36.761
Looks like a doll.

02:36.845 --> 02:39.851
You're playing with them tonight,
and everyone knows it. OK?

02:39.934 --> 02:44.067
OK, Gabe. Like What? What are you,
the smartest man on the living Earth?

02:44.234 --> 02:45.278
Yes, we are playing with them,

02:45.361 --> 02:47.407
'cause they're collector items,
so why do you care?

02:47.490 --> 02:50.371
Collectors' item means that you just
kinda put 'em on display.

02:50.455 --> 02:51.540
OK.

02:51.623 --> 02:53.127
Lady, you're 13.

02:53.210 --> 02:54.379
And?

02:54.463 --> 02:56.091
And you're still playing with dolls.

02:56.467 --> 02:59.306
Um, I saw you with a G.I. Joe last week.

02:59.389 --> 03:00.893
They're ripped, OK?

03:01.477 --> 03:03.230
OK, but you're admitting
that you play with them?

03:03.314 --> 03:05.443
I have G.I. Joes,
but I don't play with them.

03:05.526 --> 03:06.612
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

03:06.695 --> 03:09.076
<i>I'm Sam.
I don't think I play with G.I. Joes.</i>

03:10.620 --> 03:11.497
Shut up!

03:18.052 --> 03:19.596
Shut up!

03:19.679 --> 03:21.558
Shut up! Hey, everybody!

03:21.642 --> 03:24.648
Oh, my God, what's in that box,
Maya and Anna?

03:24.732 --> 03:26.485
- Are you guys playing with dolls?
- Stop it.

03:26.568 --> 03:29.282
Maya and Anna have a box full of dolls
that they're playing with tonight.

03:29.449 --> 03:30.744
- They do. Oh, my God!
- Yeah, yeah, they are.

03:30.828 --> 03:32.288
Oh, my God, stop!

03:32.330 --> 03:34.584
- Let's go.
- And Maya, what's in there?

03:34.668 --> 03:35.921
Asshole.

03:36.046 --> 03:38.259
- Bye!
- Bye!

03:41.933 --> 03:45.523
You wanna do Sylvanian still tonight or...

03:46.483 --> 03:48.947
I mean, yeah, I bought it.

03:49.197 --> 03:50.366
Yeah.

03:50.951 --> 03:54.750
Yeah, I'm really, like, do it
every Friday night since we were six.

03:54.834 --> 03:58.048
- I like one...
- You're such a slut.

03:58.132 --> 03:59.844
So what's the plan?

03:59.927 --> 04:02.307
Uh, my brother was gonna pick up
some herb for us for tonight.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.935
Ooh! Who's got it? Charney?

04:04.019 --> 04:06.315
Yeah. Oh, my God! Relax, slut.

04:06.398 --> 04:10.323
Also Kyle was talking about, like,
maybe hanging tonight.

04:10.406 --> 04:11.951
Only if he brings his older brothers.

04:12.035 --> 04:14.497
I like love Kyle Field.

04:14.581 --> 04:15.709
I thought you loved Brett Field.

04:15.792 --> 04:18.047
No, I like him,
and I like every other Field bro, too.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.221
Wait, who is that?

04:23.390 --> 04:25.228
Do you guys have a lighter?

04:25.729 --> 04:27.858
I left it in my desk.

04:27.942 --> 04:29.569
Totally chill, no worries.

04:29.779 --> 04:31.073
- Found it!
- Oh, give me.

04:31.824 --> 04:34.705
- Ah, shh.
- Shit. Can you guys get that?

04:37.418 --> 04:39.422
- Shit, run, run, run!
- What's going on here?

04:42.428 --> 04:43.807
I still see feet.

04:43.890 --> 04:46.061
Sorry, we're just eating our lunch.

04:46.144 --> 04:47.188
In here?

04:47.438 --> 04:48.649
Everything OK?

04:54.160 --> 04:56.081
That's not ours, we swear on our life.

04:56.164 --> 04:57.417
Yeah, it's not ours.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.675
Um, lessons get learned through choices.

05:01.759 --> 05:07.603
And that's why I'm going to have you
throw that away instead of me. OK?

05:07.687 --> 05:09.024
Thank you.

05:22.258 --> 05:23.720
Your brother's picking us up?

05:23.803 --> 05:26.099
Oh, my gosh, he's like so hot.

05:26.183 --> 05:27.643

05:27.728 --> 05:30.441
Ooh, shut the fuck up, slut!

05:30.483 --> 05:32.570
Oh, my gosh, chillax, Miranda.

Shut the fuck up, slut!

05:38.457 --> 05:40.336

05:41.839 --> 05:44.845
There you are, girls. OK. Let's go.

05:44.929 --> 05:48.102
Mom, what are you doing? As you remember,
at school, never get out of the car.

05:48.185 --> 05:49.479
And why are wearing that tank top?

05:49.562 --> 05:51.691
Are you kidding,
like with your breasts out?

05:56.869 --> 05:59.290
Be a bad, bad boy.

05:59.374 --> 06:01.461
- Hey...

06:07.640 --> 06:10.229
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

06:11.022 --> 06:13.026
Maya, they're trying to...

06:13.110 --> 06:15.030
No, I know. He's just busy right now.
Hold on.

All right, this is super fun, like...

06:18.120 --> 06:20.416
I'll just fricking play by myself.

It was, like, your idea to play this,
so like...

06:26.261 --> 06:29.100

06:45.090 --> 06:46.969
We are married. You can't do that anymore.

06:47.053 --> 06:48.430
It's not like middle school.

06:48.514 --> 06:49.892

10:53.670 --> 10:54.798
What?

10:54.923 --> 10:56.009
Wait.

10:56.467 --> 10:58.054
Should we spy on them?

10:58.221 --> 11:00.810
Oh, my God, you're so creepy, you stalker.

11:00.935 --> 11:03.314
- I'm not a stalker!
- What are you doing?

11:03.523 --> 11:05.152
They're having a sleepover.

11:05.235 --> 11:07.072
Let's just, like, ding dong and ditch.

11:07.281 --> 11:09.995
Oh, my God, you wanna ding dong and stay.

11:11.497 --> 11:12.416
No.

11:14.086 --> 11:16.257
OK, fine, let's just go back
to your house then.

11:16.466 --> 11:17.886
- OK.
- OK.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.055
After you...

11:23.021 --> 11:25.735
My God! I knew it. You wanna stay.

11:26.402 --> 11:28.239
- Ah!
- No, I don't.

11:28.323 --> 11:30.285
- Yes, you do.
- No, you do. You wanna do it.

11:30.410 --> 11:31.830
- No, you do it.
- No, you do it.

11:31.955 --> 11:32.916
- You do it.
- You do it.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.460
- Stop! You do it.
- Stop!

11:34.543 --> 11:36.130
- Maya...
- Anna...

11:36.172 --> 11:38.134
Don't. Don't.

11:38.468 --> 11:41.307
Stop! Anna, stop!

11:43.478 --> 11:44.688
Go!

11:44.981 --> 11:46.192
- Go!
- Who is that?

11:52.496 --> 11:53.498
Maya?

11:54.835 --> 11:55.920
Yo.

11:58.299 --> 11:59.426
Anna?

12:00.178 --> 12:02.182
She's in the bush.

12:02.349 --> 12:05.313
Um... yo, what are you doing?

12:06.482 --> 12:11.033
We were um... like,
just about to smoke.

12:11.910 --> 12:14.498
Oh, cool. Us, too. Let's smoke.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.462
Do you wanna smoke?

12:20.468 --> 12:21.429
Yeah?

12:24.435 --> 12:26.063
Oh, my God!

12:38.630 --> 12:40.383
When are the boys coming?

12:40.592 --> 12:43.097
Nine. Like... relax, biatch.

12:43.223 --> 12:44.642
Like the Fields or...

12:44.726 --> 12:46.646
There's five of us and five of them.

12:46.813 --> 12:47.774
It's perfect.

12:48.566 --> 12:50.153
Isn't one of them, like, eight?

12:50.237 --> 12:52.157
Yeah, but he's fucking hot.

12:52.241 --> 12:53.368
I wish we had herb.

12:53.493 --> 12:54.578
Who's got the beer?

12:54.913 --> 12:55.873
Oh.

13:08.398 --> 13:11.112
Do you guys drink?

13:13.032 --> 13:14.618
I need to pee.

13:32.571 --> 13:34.158
So I'm freaking the eff out.

13:34.241 --> 13:35.870
Who cares? People drink.

13:35.953 --> 13:37.247
Like, it's just beer.

13:38.751 --> 13:39.878
Who cares?

13:41.923 --> 13:43.634
The Field brothers are so hot.

13:43.719 --> 13:44.971
Wait. Wait.
Which one's the hottest one?

13:45.096 --> 13:46.140
- I like...
- It's like...

13:46.182 --> 13:47.810
- I like Kyle.
- No. Scottie.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.188
It's Kyle.

13:51.442 --> 13:52.779
Are you drinking?

13:53.739 --> 13:56.660
Yeah, like, just one sip.

13:57.747 --> 13:59.124
Without me. Cool.

13:59.709 --> 14:01.504
Anna, you take a sip.

14:01.587 --> 14:04.803
Sip! Sip! Sip!

14:04.886 --> 14:06.514
Sip, Anna, sip. Sip, Anna, sip.

14:14.196 --> 14:15.908
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

14:16.075 --> 14:17.577
Wow!

14:17.912 --> 14:19.331
- Yeah.
- Holy shit!

14:21.753 --> 14:23.631
You guys ever done computer cleaner?

14:24.550 --> 14:26.888
Yeah, actually, I have... or my dad has.

14:26.972 --> 14:29.978
He uses it for computer,
'cause it gets in all the crevices.

14:30.061 --> 14:32.775
- Yeah.
- We are inhaling not cleaning.

14:33.234 --> 14:35.572
- Yeah!
- I know!

14:35.655 --> 14:37.409
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do.

14:37.785 --> 14:39.246
I'll do it if you do it.

14:39.371 --> 14:41.292
- OK.
- OK.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.714
Me, too. If you do it.

14:44.131 --> 14:45.968
- 'Na?
- Mm-hmm.

14:46.010 --> 14:46.928
Do it then.

14:47.012 --> 14:47.930
- OK.
- OK.

14:48.014 --> 14:49.016
- Go.
- Give me space.

14:49.099 --> 14:50.101
- OK.
- Give me space.

14:51.813 --> 14:53.399
- OK.
- OK.

14:53.482 --> 14:55.028
- In your mouth.
- In your mouth.

14:55.153 --> 14:56.655
- OK. Just inhale.
- Inhale.

14:56.740 --> 14:57.783
OK, ready?

14:57.867 --> 14:59.369
Inhale! Inhale!

14:59.494 --> 15:01.165
- Let's do it.
- Inhale! Inhale!

15:01.332 --> 15:03.002
Inhale! Inhale!

15:07.010 --> 15:08.012
When does it...

15:15.610 --> 15:17.656
Oh, my God! Maya?

15:17.740 --> 15:20.161
Is this normal? Maya? Maya?

15:20.286 --> 15:22.040
- Maya?
- Ah, cool.

15:22.165 --> 15:23.167
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

15:23.292 --> 15:24.837
Oh, my God!

15:24.921 --> 15:26.215
How long were we out for?

15:26.340 --> 15:27.802
Ten seconds.

15:27.885 --> 15:32.018
We lost our minds, you guys.
That was crazy!

15:32.185 --> 15:34.398
Just you. We didn't do it.

15:34.523 --> 15:36.694
- Wait, what?
- You looked so scary.

15:36.778 --> 15:38.072
I thought you were a corpse.

15:38.155 --> 15:39.742
Wait. You didn't do it, 'Na?

15:39.826 --> 15:41.705
Sorry. I... I... I... I was gonna...

15:41.788 --> 15:43.207
It's just, like,
I'm worried about my brain.

15:43.291 --> 15:44.501
You promised.

15:44.543 --> 15:46.881
- You are fi... you are fine.
- So messed up.

15:46.965 --> 15:48.217
Guys, it's nine o'clock.

15:48.301 --> 15:50.096
- Where are the boys?
- Wait. It's nine?

15:50.179 --> 15:51.181
Can I use your phone?

15:51.390 --> 15:52.768
Yeah. My brother's room.

15:54.604 --> 15:56.860
<i>See? Now you try.</i>

16:02.203 --> 16:03.289
Hey.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.003
'Sup!

16:08.759 --> 16:11.890
Can I...
May I use your phone, please?

16:12.098 --> 16:13.769
Right in front of you... the boat.

16:16.565 --> 16:17.442
Oh.

16:21.033 --> 16:22.953
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Mama.

16:23.037 --> 16:25.416
- <i>Is everything OK?</i>
- Yeah. We're just...

16:25.541 --> 16:28.089
We are about to go to bed,
so I just wanted to say good night.

16:28.130 --> 16:30.301
- <i>OK, I hear something.</i>
- Yeah.

16:30.385 --> 16:34.226
Um, it's just... it's a movie Anna rented.

16:34.351 --> 16:36.146
We're just... yeah.

16:36.230 --> 16:37.148
It's <i>Home Alone.</i>

16:37.190 --> 16:38.150
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

16:38.484 --> 16:39.987
<i>Be polite.</i>

16:40.071 --> 16:41.615
<i>Oyasumi.</i>

16:44.037 --> 16:46.458
<i>Fun, real fun.</i>

16:46.709 --> 16:48.003
Thank you. Good-bye.

17:29.503 --> 17:31.883
My mom's not home, so...

17:32.634 --> 17:33.552
Cool.

17:39.857 --> 17:42.111
Uh... Stevie.

17:47.915 --> 17:49.125
Charney I guess.

17:49.167 --> 17:50.378
Sick.

17:59.396 --> 18:00.273
You.

18:00.356 --> 18:01.358
Yes!

18:06.660 --> 18:08.163
The... the tall one.

18:23.569 --> 18:24.947
Do you need help with that?

18:25.031 --> 18:26.199
Got it.

18:30.374 --> 18:31.335
Wait.

18:38.349 --> 18:39.267
What do you want?

18:39.392 --> 18:41.981
Um, all the good spots are taken.

18:42.858 --> 18:45.363
Well, we can't do
everything together, so...

18:57.095 --> 18:59.516
You ever play Crash Bandicoot?

19:02.982 --> 19:03.942
What?

19:06.739 --> 19:09.577
- You gonna do it?
- OK.

19:14.462 --> 19:15.631
Wait. Mm-hmm.

19:22.980 --> 19:24.399
OK.

19:24.984 --> 19:27.030
This is what I look like without it.

19:27.906 --> 19:31.121
We've just done everything together
since, like, '93.

19:31.204 --> 19:34.754
And then all of a sudden, it's, like,
everything can just change

19:34.879 --> 19:37.467
in, like, a flip or an instant.

19:37.592 --> 19:39.262
I know exactly what you mean.

19:39.930 --> 19:43.772
My grandmother... died last year.

19:44.397 --> 19:47.195
Then you probably know exactly how I feel.

19:47.278 --> 19:49.240
I mean, I... I think so.

19:58.175 --> 19:59.177
Dragon.

19:59.385 --> 20:01.098
I don't know how long
you've known your grandma.

20:01.181 --> 20:04.646
I've known Maya...
literally forever.

20:04.687 --> 20:07.778
Maybe it's more or less like,

20:07.861 --> 20:09.990
when my magic cards got stolen.

20:10.491 --> 20:12.871
I thought we were on the same page,
but like...

20:13.832 --> 20:14.959
You lost me.

20:16.461 --> 20:17.756
Wait, look...

20:20.636 --> 20:22.473
I'm a scarecrow.

20:23.308 --> 20:24.310
What?

20:25.981 --> 20:29.279
Like, if you don't wanna hook up,
that's fine. I mean, like...

20:30.322 --> 20:32.535
I just thought, you know,
we're in like, you know...

20:32.828 --> 20:35.541
Oh, just fricking start with a kiss.

20:38.213 --> 20:39.674
You're gonna come in right now?

20:39.717 --> 20:41.011
Uh-huh.

20:41.303 --> 20:42.764
Onto my lips?

20:45.937 --> 20:47.690
Hoot! Hoot!

20:47.816 --> 20:49.694
I'm an owl now.

20:50.196 --> 20:52.450
I'm...

20:52.743 --> 20:54.204
Someone's coming.

20:54.245 --> 20:55.164
Is that your mom?

20:55.790 --> 20:57.043
What the hell is going on?

20:57.460 --> 20:59.339
- Hurry.
- Take this.

21:00.216 --> 21:01.551
- Me?
- Go. Go.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.641
What's happening?

21:07.856 --> 21:09.234
Shh. She's coming.

21:10.779 --> 21:11.906
Hi, Mom.

21:11.989 --> 21:13.450
- Hi, Ms. Harris.
- Hi, Ms. Harris.

21:14.494 --> 21:16.456
Hi. How's your girls' night?

21:16.539 --> 21:17.541
- Good.
- Pretty good.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.545
Um, just playing cards.

21:25.391 --> 21:26.393
What's this?

21:29.274 --> 21:30.860
Whose beer is this?

21:39.669 --> 21:41.589
- Did you drink this beer?
- No.

21:41.716 --> 21:43.093
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.595
- Is that my coat?
- Ye-Yeah.

21:44.722 --> 21:45.974
Come here. Come here.

21:46.057 --> 21:47.853
- No.
- Let me smell your breath.

21:56.787 --> 21:58.123
OK.

21:58.833 --> 22:00.754
I'm gonna need to call your mom.

22:00.795 --> 22:02.256
Oh, my God, my mom.

22:03.175 --> 22:04.427
'Na...

22:22.798 --> 22:26.096
Maya, what are you doing? Go to bed.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.808
Just having water.

22:27.933 --> 22:31.022
You like, yelled at me for an hour.
Give me a break.

22:31.314 --> 22:34.654
- OK, just drink it and go to bed. OK?
- OK.

22:47.263 --> 22:48.640
- Anna!
- Maya!

22:49.142 --> 22:50.812
Go away! I'm mad at you.

22:50.895 --> 22:53.316
I want you to. That's why we need to talk.
Open the door.

22:53.358 --> 22:54.945
Keep your voice down. No!

22:55.571 --> 22:57.158
- Open the... what the fuck are you doing?
- No.

22:57.199 --> 22:58.828
- Don't.
- No.

22:58.911 --> 22:59.872
- No!
- OK.

23:00.832 --> 23:01.917
Whatever.

23:04.840 --> 23:05.925
Gone.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.766
Be quiet.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.066
I got it.

23:23.668 --> 23:26.049
Stop rolling your eyes, Anna.

23:26.174 --> 23:28.220
I'm sorry. I don't realize when I do it.

23:29.138 --> 23:30.015
Ugh!

23:30.140 --> 23:32.186
- You just hit...
- OK. Well, I didn't mean to.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.146
Sorry.

23:40.369 --> 23:42.456
Well, I'm just glad that you're OK, so...

23:42.498 --> 23:43.667
Well, I'm not literally OK,

23:43.751 --> 23:45.755
because you left me to get in trouble
by myself.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.677
You're the one that said,
"We can't do everything together,"

23:48.803 --> 23:50.097
when you were in the closet with that boy.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.685
I only said that,
because I did you-know-what...

23:52.769 --> 23:54.063
and you didn't do it with me.

23:54.188 --> 23:56.401
- Are you serious?
- Shh! My mom!

23:56.526 --> 23:57.528
Oh, my God! I'm being shush...

23:57.611 --> 24:00.284
My mom is literally, like, right outside.
So can you please be quiet?

24:00.367 --> 24:01.787
- Shh!
- Are you kidding me?

24:01.870 --> 24:03.874
You just said "are" so loud.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.377
Stop, Anna.

24:08.425 --> 24:10.972
When I came out of the bathroom,
you were already like...

24:11.514 --> 24:12.976
Are you serious?

24:13.059 --> 24:15.397
<i>Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.</i>

24:15.522 --> 24:16.399
<i>Yeah, you serious?</i>

24:16.441 --> 24:17.944
Like, seriously, Anna,

24:18.069 --> 24:20.449
you were the one that was like

24:20.532 --> 24:22.453
Are you kidding? You did it before me.

24:22.578 --> 24:24.498
Like, we were supposed
to have our first, like...

24:25.542 --> 24:26.544
together.

24:26.669 --> 24:28.381
And now that moment's gone forever.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.264
What happened in the closet with that boy?

24:33.475 --> 24:35.938
You mean, like, nothing. I swear.

24:36.064 --> 24:40.697
Like, he wanted to hook up with me,
but I was like... no.

24:43.578 --> 24:46.835
Did you... with your guy?

24:46.919 --> 24:48.338
No, he's, like, eight.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.592
Yeah, but he's fucking hot.

24:50.927 --> 24:52.096
Yeah.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.149
I know that you're bored in pretend.

24:58.776 --> 25:00.070
'Na, like...

25:00.404 --> 25:02.199
Come on. You were bored, too,

25:02.282 --> 25:04.120
like, don't even pretend.

25:06.624 --> 25:08.253
I know you're just, like, over me.

25:08.378 --> 25:11.467
'Na, I'm, like, obviously never over you.

25:11.969 --> 25:14.140
Like, come here.

25:14.808 --> 25:16.102
No, I know you are.

25:16.227 --> 25:18.273
I'm not. I swear.

25:19.233 --> 25:20.402
Come on.

25:21.571 --> 25:22.782
Just, like, put them on.

25:24.535 --> 25:26.247
You bitch!

25:26.330 --> 25:27.249
Slut!

25:32.761 --> 25:34.263
I guess I'm sleeping over.

25:34.765 --> 25:36.017
Oh, my God!

25:37.394 --> 25:39.482
Oh, my God!

25:39.607 --> 25:40.985
Should we flush it?

25:41.444 --> 25:45.660
We could, like... still have
our first together if you want.

25:46.287 --> 25:49.460
OK, I will... if you will I guess.

25:50.629 --> 25:52.967
I don't know. I'm, like, still drunk.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.723
Yeah, like, big decisions should be made
when we're, like, sober.

25:55.807 --> 25:58.478
But I promise, like, when we do do it...

25:59.480 --> 26:01.317
like, we'll do it together.

26:05.075 --> 26:06.410
Wait. I wanna...

26:06.536 --> 26:08.958
- Where you gonna...
- Up here.

26:12.256 --> 26:14.385
- Shh!
- Shh!

26:53.254 --> 26:54.256
Hmm.

26:56.677 --> 26:58.849
Hoot! Hoot! I'm an owl now.
