00:28.975 --> 00:31.229
<i>- That I can't do this anymore.
- What?</i>

<i>I have a wife and kids at home.</i>

00:34.611 --> 00:37.074
<i>And I got a husband

01:44.291 --> 01:48.174
Can you get something out of my backpack?

02:11.137 --> 02:12.055
I know.

02:12.139 --> 02:13.535
We should definitely do this tonight.

02:13.559 --> 02:14.978
Oh, my God, yes!

02:15.061 --> 02:16.481
<i>Beth, we've talked about this.</i>

02:16.565 --> 02:18.151

02:22.619 --> 02:24.205

02:24.288 --> 02:25.457
Why do you have dolls?

02:26.375 --> 02:29.006
We don't. These this...

02:29.549 --> 02:30.549
These that?

02:30.593 --> 02:32.471
- That's not a doll.
- That, no.

02:32.555 --> 02:34.559
- That's investment from eBay.
- Yeah.

02:34.643 --> 02:35.561
Looks like a doll.

02:35.645 --> 02:38.651
You're playing with them tonight,
and everyone knows it. OK?

02:38.734 --> 02:42.867
OK, Gabe. Like What? What are you,
the smartest man on the living Earth?

02:43.034 --> 02:44.137
Yes, we are playing with them,

02:44.161 --> 02:46.207
'cause they're collector items,
so why do you care?

02:46.290 --> 02:49.171
Collectors' item means that you just
kinda put 'em on display.

02:49.255 --> 02:50.340
OK.

02:50.423 --> 02:51.927
Lady, you're 13.

02:52.010 --> 02:53.179
And?

02:53.263 --> 02:54.891
And you're still playing with dolls.

02:55.267 --> 02:58.106
Um, I saw you with a G.I. Joe last week.

02:58.189 --> 02:59.693
They're ripped, OK?

03:00.277 --> 03:02.090
OK, but you're admitting
that you play with them?

03:02.114 --> 03:04.243
I have G.I. Joes,
but I don't play with them.

03:04.326 --> 03:05.412
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

03:05.495 --> 03:07.876

03:53.634 --> 03:56.848
- I like one...
- You're such a slut.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.644
So what's the plan?

03:58.727 --> 04:01.166
Uh, my brother was gonna pick up
some herb for us for tonight.

04:01.190 --> 04:02.735
Ooh! Who's got it? Charney?

04:02.819 --> 04:05.115
Yeah. Oh, my God! Relax, slut.

04:05.198 --> 04:09.123
Also Kyle was talking about, like,
maybe hanging tonight.

04:09.206 --> 04:10.751
Only if he brings his older brothers.

04:10.835 --> 04:13.297
I like love Kyle Field.

04:13.381 --> 04:14.568
I thought you loved Brett Field.

04:14.592 --> 04:16.847
No, I like him,
and I like every other Field bro, too.

04:19.811 --> 04:21.021
Wait, who is that?

04:22.190 --> 04:24.028
Do you guys have a lighter?

04:24.529 --> 04:26.658
I left it in my desk.

04:26.742 --> 04:28.369
Totally chill, no worries.

04:28.579 --> 04:29.873
- Found it!
- Oh, give me.

04:30.624 --> 04:33.505
- Ah, shh.

04:36.218 --> 04:38.222
- Shit, run, run, run!
- What's going on here?

04:41.228 --> 04:42.607
I still see feet.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.861
Sorry, we're just eating our lunch.

04:44.944 --> 04:45.988
In here?

04:46.238 --> 04:47.449
Everything OK?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.881
That's not ours, we swear on our life.

04:54.964 --> 04:56.217
Yeah, it's not ours.

04:56.300 --> 05:00.475
Um, lessons get learned through choices.

05:00.559 --> 05:06.403
And that's why I'm going to have you
throw that away instead of me. OK?

05:06.487 --> 05:07.824
Thank you.

05:21.058 --> 05:22.520

Are you kidding,

- So... two?
- Two.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.394
- Yeah, two. We'll just, like, do two.
- We'll just do two.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.673
- Whatever, you know. Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:30.426 --> 10:31.846
Wait, partner.

10:31.929 --> 10:33.182
Oh, my God.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.981
Put it away. Put it away. Put it away.
Go. Go. Go.

10:37.023 --> 10:38.023
This way. This way.

10:39.862 --> 10:43.452
- He like, literally thought we were...
- Wait. Which one do you think...

10:43.536 --> 10:45.039
No, wait.
Oh, my God! 'Na!

10:45.122 --> 10:46.793
- Look. Oh, my God!
- What?

10:47.961 --> 10:50.049
That's Miranda's brother's car.

10:50.634 --> 10:51.636
Oh!

10:52.470 --> 10:53.598
What?

10:53.723 --> 10:54.809
Wait.

10:55.267 --> 10:56.854
Should we spy on them?

10:57.021 --> 10:59.610
Oh, my God, you're so creepy, you stalker.

10:59.735 --> 11:02.114
- I'm not a stalker!
- What are you doing?

11:02.323 --> 11:03.952
They're having a sleepover.

11:04.035 --> 11:05.872
Let's just, like, ding dong and ditch.

11:06.081 --> 11:08.795
Oh, my God, you wanna ding dong and stay.

11:10.297 --> 11:11.297
No.

11:12.886 --> 11:15.057
OK, fine, let's just go back
to your house then.

11:15.266 --> 11:16.686
- OK.
- OK.

11:16.811 --> 11:17.855
After you...

11:21.821 --> 11:24.535
My God! I knew it. You wanna stay.

11:25.202 --> 11:27.039
- Ah!
- No, I don't.

11:27.123 --> 11:29.085
- Yes, you do.
- No, you do. You wanna do it.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.630
- No, you do it.
- No, you do it.

11:30.755 --> 11:31.755
- You do it.
- You do it.

11:31.799 --> 11:33.260
- Stop! You do it.
- Stop!

11:33.343 --> 11:34.930
- Maya...
- Anna...

11:34.972 --> 11:36.934
Don't. Don't.

11:37.268 --> 11:40.107
Stop! Anna, stop!

11:42.278 --> 11:43.488
Go!

11:43.781 --> 11:44.992
- Go!
- Who is that?

11:51.296 --> 11:52.298
Maya?

11:53.635 --> 11:54.720
Yo.

11:57.099 --> 11:58.226
Anna?

11:58.978 --> 12:00.982
She's in the bush.

12:01.149 --> 12:04.113
Um... yo, what are you doing?

12:05.282 --> 12:09.833
We were um... like,
just about to smoke.

12:10.710 --> 12:13.298
Oh, cool. Us, too. Let's smoke.

12:14.175 --> 12:16.262
Do you wanna smoke?

12:19.268 --> 12:20.268
Yeah?

12:23.235 --> 12:24.863
Oh, my God!

12:37.430 --> 12:39.183
When are the boys coming?

12:39.392 --> 12:41.897
Nine. Like... relax, biatch.

12:42.023 --> 12:43.442
Like the Fields or...

12:43.526 --> 12:45.446
There's five of us and five of them.

12:45.613 --> 12:46.613
It's perfect.

12:47.366 --> 12:48.953
Isn't one of them, like, eight?

12:49.037 --> 12:50.957
Yeah, but he's fucking hot.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.168
I wish we had herb.

12:52.293 --> 12:53.378
Who's got the beer?

12:53.713 --> 12:54.713
Oh.

13:07.198 --> 13:09.912
Do you guys drink?

13:11.832 --> 13:13.418
I need to pee.

13:31.371 --> 13:32.958
So I'm freaking the eff out.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.670
Who cares? People drink.

13:34.753 --> 13:36.047
Like, it's just beer.

13:37.551 --> 13:38.678
Who cares?

13:40.723 --> 13:42.434
The Field brothers are so hot.

13:42.519 --> 13:43.872
Wait. Wait.
Which one's the hottest one?

13:43.896 --> 13:44.940
- I like...
- It's like...

13:44.982 --> 13:46.610
- I like Kyle.
- No. Scottie.

13:46.694 --> 13:47.988
It's Kyle.

13:50.242 --> 13:51.579
Are you drinking?

13:52.539 --> 13:55.460
Yeah, like, just one sip.

13:56.547 --> 13:57.924
Without me. Cool.

13:58.509 --> 14:00.304
Anna, you take a sip.

14:00.387 --> 14:03.603
Sip! Sip! Sip!

14:03.686 --> 14:05.314
Sip, Anna, sip. Sip, Anna, sip.

14:12.996 --> 14:14.708
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

14:14.875 --> 14:16.377
Wow!

14:16.712 --> 14:18.131
- Yeah.
- Holy shit!

14:20.553 --> 14:22.431
You guys ever done computer cleaner?

14:23.350 --> 14:25.688
Yeah, actually, I have... or my dad has.

14:25.772 --> 14:28.778
He uses it for computer,
'cause it gets in all the crevices.

14:28.861 --> 14:31.575
- Yeah.
- We are inhaling not cleaning.

14:32.034 --> 14:34.372
- Yeah!
- I know!

14:34.455 --> 14:36.209
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.046
I'll do it if you do it.

14:38.171 --> 14:40.092
- OK.
- OK.

14:40.258 --> 14:42.514
Me, too. If you do it.

14:42.931 --> 14:44.768
- 'Na?
- Mm-hmm.

14:44.810 --> 14:45.728
Do it then.

14:45.812 --> 14:46.730
- OK.
- OK.

14:46.814 --> 14:47.816
- Go.
- Give me space.

14:47.899 --> 14:48.901
- OK.
- Give me space.

14:50.613 --> 14:52.199
- OK.
- OK.

14:52.282 --> 14:53.828
- In your mouth.
- In your mouth.

14:53.953 --> 14:55.455
- OK. Just inhale.
- Inhale.

14:55.540 --> 14:56.583
OK, ready?

14:56.667 --> 14:58.169
Inhale! Inhale!

14:58.294 --> 14:59.965
- Let's do it.
- Inhale! Inhale!

15:00.132 --> 15:01.802
Inhale! Inhale!

15:05.810 --> 15:06.812
When does it...

15:14.410 --> 15:16.456
Oh, my God! Maya?

15:16.540 --> 15:18.961
Is this normal? Maya? Maya?

15:19.086 --> 15:20.840
- Maya?
- Ah, cool.

15:20.965 --> 15:21.967
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

15:22.092 --> 15:23.637
Oh, my God!

15:23.721 --> 15:25.015
How long were we out for?

15:25.140 --> 15:26.602
Ten seconds.

15:26.685 --> 15:30.818
We lost our minds, you guys.
That was crazy!

15:30.985 --> 15:33.198
Just you. We didn't do it.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.494
- Wait, what?
- You looked so scary.

15:35.578 --> 15:36.872
I thought you were a corpse.

15:36.955 --> 15:38.542
Wait. You didn't do it, 'Na?

15:38.626 --> 15:40.505
Sorry. I... I... I... I was gonna...

15:40.588 --> 15:42.067
It's just, like,
I'm worried about my brain.

15:42.091 --> 15:43.301
You promised.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.681
- You are fi... you are fine.
- So messed up.

15:45.765 --> 15:47.017
Guys, it's nine o'clock.

15:47.101 --> 15:48.896
- Where are the boys?
- Wait. It's nine?

15:48.979 --> 15:49.981
Can I use your phone?

15:50.190 --> 15:51.568
Yeah. My brother's room.

15:53.404 --> 15:55.660
<i>See? Now you try.</i>

16:01.003 --> 16:02.089
Hey.

16:03.634 --> 16:04.803

16:07.559 --> 16:10.690
Can I...
May I use your phone, please?

16:10.898 --> 16:12.569
Right in front of you... the boat.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.365
Oh.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.753
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Mama.

16:21.837 --> 16:24.216
- <i>Is everything OK?</i>
- Yeah. We're just...

16:24.341 --> 16:26.889
We are about to go to bed,
so I just wanted to say good night.

16:26.930 --> 16:29.101
- <i>OK, I hear something.</i>
- Yeah.

16:29.185 --> 16:33.026
Um, it's just... it's a movie Anna rented.

16:33.151 --> 16:34.946
We're just... yeah.

16:35.030 --> 16:35.948
It's <i>Home Alone.</i>

16:35.990 --> 16:36.990

18:37.149 --> 18:38.149
What do you want?

18:38.192 --> 18:40.781
Um, all the good spots are taken.

18:41.658 --> 18:44.163
Well, we can't do
everything together, so...

18:55.895 --> 18:58.316
You ever play Crash Bandicoot?

19:01.782 --> 19:02.782
What?

19:05.539 --> 19:08.377
- You gonna do it?
- OK.

19:13.262 --> 19:14.431
Wait. Mm-hmm.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.199
OK.

19:23.784 --> 19:25.830
This is what I look like without it.

19:26.706 --> 19:29.921
We've just done everything together
since, like, '93.

19:30.004 --> 19:33.554
And then all of a sudden, it's, like,
everything can just change

19:33.679 --> 19:36.267
in, like, a flip or an instant.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.062
I know exactly what you mean.

19:38.730 --> 19:42.572
My grandmother... died last year.

19:43.197 --> 19:45.995
Then you probably know exactly how I feel.

19:46.078 --> 19:48.040
I mean, I... I think so.

19:56.975 --> 19:57.977
Dragon.

19:58.185 --> 19:59.957
I don't know how long
you've known your grandma.

19:59.981 --> 20:03.446
I've known Maya...
literally forever.

20:03.487 --> 20:06.578
Maybe it's more or less like,

20:06.661 --> 20:08.790
when my magic cards got stolen.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.671
I thought we were on the same page,
but like...

20:12.632 --> 20:13.759
You lost me.

20:15.261 --> 20:16.556
Wait, look...

20:19.436 --> 20:21.273
I'm a scarecrow.

20:22.108 --> 20:23.110
What?

20:24.781 --> 20:28.079
Like, if you don't wanna hook up,
that's fine. I mean, like...

20:29.122 --> 20:31.335
I just thought, you know,
we're in like, you know...

20:31.628 --> 20:34.341
Oh, just fricking start with a kiss.

20:37.013 --> 20:38.474
You're gonna come in right now?

20:38.517 --> 20:39.811
Uh-huh.

20:40.103 --> 20:41.564
Onto my lips?

20:44.737 --> 20:46.490
Hoot! Hoot!

20:46.616 --> 20:48.494
I'm an owl now.

20:48.996 --> 20:51.250
I'm...

20:51.543 --> 20:53.004
Someone's coming.

20:53.045 --> 20:54.045
Is that your mom?

20:54.590 --> 20:55.843
What the hell is going on?

20:56.260 --> 20:58.139
- Hurry.
- Take this.

20:59.016 --> 21:00.351
- Me?
- Go. Go.

21:02.188 --> 21:03.441
What's happening?

21:06.656 --> 21:08.034
Shh. She's coming.

21:09.579 --> 21:10.706
Hi, Mom.

21:10.789 --> 21:12.250
- Hi, Ms. Harris.
- Hi, Ms. Harris.

21:13.294 --> 21:15.256
Hi. How's your girls' night?

21:15.339 --> 21:16.341
- Good.
- Pretty good.

21:16.467 --> 21:18.345
Um, just playing cards.

21:24.191 --> 21:25.193
What's this?

21:28.074 --> 21:29.660
Whose beer is this?

21:38.469 --> 21:40.389
- Did you drink this beer?
- No.

21:40.516 --> 21:41.893
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

21:41.976 --> 21:43.395
- Is that my coat?
- Ye-Yeah.

21:43.522 --> 21:44.774
Come here. Come here.

21:44.857 --> 21:46.653
- No.
- Let me smell your breath.

21:55.587 --> 21:56.923
OK.

21:57.633 --> 21:59.554
I'm gonna need to call your mom.

21:59.595 --> 22:01.056
Oh, my God, my mom.

22:01.975 --> 22:03.227
'Na...

22:21.598 --> 22:24.896
Maya, what are you doing? Go to bed.

22:24.979 --> 22:26.608
Just having water.

22:26.733 --> 22:29.822
You like, yelled at me for an hour.
Give me a break.

22:30.114 --> 22:33.454
- OK, just drink it and go to bed. OK?
- OK.

22:46.063 --> 22:47.440
- Anna!
- Maya!

22:47.942 --> 22:49.612
Go away! I'm mad at you.

22:49.695 --> 22:52.116
I want you to. That's why we need to talk.
Open the door.

22:52.158 --> 22:53.745
Keep your voice down. No!

22:54.371 --> 22:55.975
- Open the... what the fuck are you doing?
- No.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.628
- Don't.
- No.

22:57.711 --> 22:58.711
- No!
- OK.

22:59.632 --> 23:00.717
Whatever.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.725
Gone.

23:07.188 --> 23:08.566
Be quiet.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.866
I got it.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.849
Stop rolling your eyes, Anna.

23:24.974 --> 23:27.020
I'm sorry. I don't realize when I do it.

23:27.938 --> 23:28.815
Ugh!

23:28.940 --> 23:30.986
- You just hit...
- OK. Well, I didn't mean to.

23:31.111 --> 23:32.111
Sorry.

23:39.169 --> 23:41.256
Well, I'm just glad that you're OK, so...

23:41.298 --> 23:42.467
Well, I'm not literally OK,

23:42.551 --> 23:44.555
because you left me to get in trouble
by myself.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.477
You're the one that said,
"We can't do everything together,"

23:47.603 --> 23:48.914
when you were in the closet with that boy.

23:48.938 --> 23:51.485
I only said that,
because I did you-know-what...

23:51.569 --> 23:52.863
and you didn't do it with me.

23:52.988 --> 23:55.201
- Are you serious?
- Shh! My mom!

23:55.326 --> 23:56.387
Oh, my God! I'm being shush...

23:56.411 --> 23:59.131
My mom is literally, like, right outside.
So can you please be quiet?

23:59.167 --> 24:00.587
- Shh!
- Are you kidding me?

24:00.670 --> 24:02.674
You just said "are" so loud.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.177
Stop, Anna.

24:07.225 --> 24:09.772
When I came out of the bathroom,
you were already like...

24:10.314 --> 24:11.776
Are you serious?

24:11.859 --> 24:14.197
<i>Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.</i>

24:14.322 --> 24:15.199
<i>Yeah, you serious?</i>

24:15.241 --> 24:16.744
Like, seriously, Anna,

24:16.869 --> 24:19.249
you were the one that was like

24:19.332 --> 24:21.253
Are you kidding? You did it before me.

24:21.378 --> 24:23.298
Like, we were supposed
to have our first, like...

24:24.342 --> 24:25.344
together.

24:25.469 --> 24:27.181
And now that moment's gone forever.

24:29.185 --> 24:31.064
What happened in the closet with that boy?

24:32.275 --> 24:34.738
You mean, like, nothing. I swear.

24:34.864 --> 24:39.497
Like, he wanted to hook up with me,
but I was like... no.

24:42.378 --> 24:45.635
Did you... with your guy?

24:45.719 --> 24:47.138
No, he's, like, eight.

24:47.388 --> 24:49.392
Yeah, but he's fucking hot.

24:49.727 --> 24:50.896
Yeah.

24:54.528 --> 24:56.949
I know that you're bored in pretend.

24:57.576 --> 24:58.870
'Na, like...

24:59.204 --> 25:00.999
Come on. You were bored, too,

25:01.082 --> 25:02.920
like, don't even pretend.

25:05.424 --> 25:07.053
I know you're just, like, over me.

25:07.178 --> 25:10.267
'Na, I'm, like, obviously never over you.

25:10.769 --> 25:12.940
Like, come here.

25:13.608 --> 25:14.902
No, I know you are.

25:15.027 --> 25:17.073
I'm not. I swear.

25:18.033 --> 25:19.202
Come on.

25:20.371 --> 25:21.582
Just, like, put them on.

25:23.335 --> 25:25.047
You bitch!

25:25.130 --> 25:26.130
Slut!

25:31.561 --> 25:33.063
I guess I'm sleeping over.

25:33.565 --> 25:34.817
Oh, my God!

25:36.194 --> 25:38.282
Oh, my God!

25:38.407 --> 25:39.785
Should we flush it?

25:40.244 --> 25:44.460
We could, like... still have
our first together if you want.

25:45.087 --> 25:48.260
OK, I will... if you will I guess.

25:49.429 --> 25:51.767
I don't know. I'm, like, still drunk.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.523
Yeah, like, big decisions should be made
when we're, like, sober.

25:54.607 --> 25:57.278
But I promise, like, when we do do it...

25:58.280 --> 26:00.117
like, we'll do it together.

26:03.875 --> 26:05.210
Wait. I wanna...

26:05.336 --> 26:07.758
- Where you gonna...
- Up here.

26:11.056 --> 26:13.185
- Shh!
- Shh!

26:52.054 --> 26:53.056
Hmm.

26:55.477 --> 26:57.649
Hoot! Hoot! I'm an owl now.
