00:01.545 --> 00:03.841
<i>Bye, Mom. Love you.</i>

00:05.512 --> 00:06.513
<i>Is she OK?</i>

00:06.931 --> 00:09.811
- She, like, didn't come down.
- That's OK.

00:12.776 --> 00:14.613
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

00:15.239 --> 00:16.575
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

00:18.788 --> 00:19.957
Really?

00:21.502 --> 00:22.754
Really, Dad.

00:34.736 --> 00:37.324
You don't have any lingering questions
on your mind?

00:38.828 --> 00:39.913
No, I mean...

00:42.836 --> 00:44.715
I just think that probably
the hardest part

00:44.798 --> 00:46.677
was when you and mom told me.

00:47.846 --> 00:52.814
Um... but I think that it's ultimately

00:52.897 --> 00:54.568
gonna be the best for everyone honestly,

00:54.651 --> 00:56.589
- because we could all use a breather...
- <i>We could all use a breather...</i>

00:56.613 --> 00:58.491
from the recent hostility.

00:59.828 --> 01:03.209
It's not like
things are gonna get any better.

01:04.921 --> 01:07.802
<i>And maybe sometime,
after you guys take some space,</i>

01:07.886 --> 01:10.516
you guys might wanna get back together
or something. I don't know.

01:12.562 --> 01:13.856

01:14.524 --> 01:15.777

Hey.

01:51.598 --> 01:54.353
Sorry I yelled at you last night.

01:56.692 --> 01:58.863
Yeah, I thought I'd hear from you.

01:59.823 --> 02:03.329
Last night was just really shitty
and like...

02:04.290 --> 02:07.421
Yeah, last night was really shitty
for me, too.

02:10.051 --> 02:11.429
You know...

02:12.891 --> 02:15.938
guess we just can't do everything together
like we thought.

02:18.527 --> 02:20.363
I'm just saying "hey"
to Heather really quick.

02:23.954 --> 02:25.457
- Hey.
- Hi, Anna.

02:25.541 --> 02:26.877
Hey.

02:28.631 --> 02:30.383
- Hey, um...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

02:30.467 --> 02:31.845
No, it's not, it's fine.

02:32.387 --> 02:34.518
I'm sorry about your parents' divorce.

02:35.101 --> 02:37.231
- Oh, thanks.
- When my parents divorced,

02:37.314 --> 02:40.403
it, like, sucked, but... you'll be fine.

02:40.487 --> 02:44.119
- It's just hard to comprehend.
- Yeah.

02:44.203 --> 02:46.266
Yeah, I know it feels
like the world's ending, right?

02:46.290 --> 02:49.756
Yeah, it... it really does,
and I'm, like, kind of in shock.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.887
Mm-hmm. On the bright side,
you'll get two of everything.

02:53.221 --> 02:56.937
- So I gotta go.
- OK. Bye. Oh, thanks.

02:57.396 --> 02:58.439
I'm OK.

03:37.894 --> 03:38.937
Where's Anna?

03:40.650 --> 03:41.693
I don't know.

03:42.444 --> 03:43.572
She's over there.

03:44.741 --> 03:46.369
The popular girls.

03:51.337 --> 03:53.007
So she's sitting with them now?

03:54.426 --> 03:56.055
It's really different.

03:56.138 --> 03:58.393
Do you know that she told Heather
before she told me

03:58.476 --> 03:59.996
that her parents are getting divorced?

04:00.856 --> 04:03.444
- Can you believe that?
- OK.

04:04.196 --> 04:06.492
I'm gonna tell you something, Maya.

04:06.576 --> 04:10.458
- Just... don't freak out.
- Don't say anything to me right now.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.672
What do you have to say? What? What?

04:13.882 --> 04:17.389
All right. I heard a rumor that

04:17.472 --> 04:21.147
Heather is taking Anna to the dance.

04:21.230 --> 04:22.734
What? What did you say?

04:22.817 --> 04:24.588
That was our plan
to go to the dance together.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.616
We had a lot of plans tonight
so that's real...

04:27.242 --> 04:30.415
Ho, ho, bitch. OK. OK.

04:30.958 --> 04:34.048
Well, at least we're still going together.

04:37.722 --> 04:39.851
I mean, together, as in like a group.

04:40.101 --> 04:41.101
Hi, guys. Hey, Maya.

04:41.145 --> 04:42.185
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey, Jenna.

04:42.397 --> 04:43.609
Hey, Jeanine.

04:44.068 --> 04:45.780
- It's Jenna.
- What?

04:46.030 --> 04:48.577
- It's Jenna.
- That's what I said. "Hey, Jenna".

04:49.495 --> 04:51.583
- Wassup.
- The sun.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.338
JK.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.588
Oh, my God.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.287
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:52.370 --> 05:53.372
Hi.

05:53.582 --> 05:54.685
Is something wrong with the toilet?

05:54.709 --> 05:57.422
No. No, you don't have to look.
That's not...

05:58.842 --> 06:02.307
Uh, you know... you can't flush pads.

06:02.432 --> 06:04.144
No, I know. That's not a pa...

06:04.228 --> 06:05.396
- That's not mine.
- Mm.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.192
'Cause I don't, I don't have my periods,

06:07.275 --> 06:11.116
so I think that's someone
that put in there...

06:11.408 --> 06:16.001
Uh, you know, it's... it's natural.
It happens to everyone.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.757
Good for them.

06:21.387 --> 06:24.936
Ahem. Here. For whenever.

06:28.025 --> 06:31.156
Well, I don't need it,
so I'll find someone who does.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.375
- Maya.
- What?

06:57.459 --> 06:58.962
- Get off the computer!
- OK.

06:59.254 --> 07:01.050
- Now!
- OK.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.603
Hello. Ah!

07:06.686 --> 07:09.817
It's your first shave before
your first dance. Are you two excited?

07:10.318 --> 07:11.361
It's gonna be fun.

07:12.238 --> 07:14.994
OK, this is a really big deal, girls.

07:15.078 --> 07:17.750
Yeah. Once you start, you can never stop.

07:17.833 --> 07:22.133
I just wanna make sure you know for sure
if you really want to start shaving.

07:24.806 --> 07:25.974
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

07:26.058 --> 07:27.393
- OK. OK.
- OK.

07:27.477 --> 07:28.395
Yeah.

07:28.479 --> 07:30.651
- Oh, you got me wet.
- I'm sorry.

07:30.734 --> 07:31.736
Oh, it's OK.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.451
You might bleed or cut,
so be careful.

07:36.161 --> 07:39.417
Maya, don't shave over your knees.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.465
- Mom...
- Always under and under your short pants.

07:42.550 --> 07:44.595
Mom, they're called pedal pushers, like...

07:44.929 --> 07:47.601
OK, whatever. Pedal pushers, OK?

07:58.372 --> 07:59.917
Why are you looking at me
like that?

08:00.001 --> 08:01.481
I'm not looking like you at anything.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.428
What?

08:06.096 --> 08:08.184
What time do you think
you're gonna be at Sam's?

08:13.570 --> 08:16.576
Um, what time? I don't know.
I'm not that good at time.

08:17.745 --> 08:19.874
Oh, really? 'Cause I feel,
like, you're usually,

08:20.208 --> 08:24.132
like, always on time and good with time
and, like, keeping time.

08:25.677 --> 08:28.975
- Why do you keep saying "time"?
- 'Cause, um...

08:29.769 --> 08:34.528
I heard that you were invited to Heather's
to get ready at her house before.

08:41.834 --> 08:42.994
Is that what you're gonna do?

08:45.341 --> 08:47.095
No, I didn't say that.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.474
I might take pictures

08:50.184 --> 08:52.021
after this with Heather

08:52.105 --> 08:55.779
and do half the time there
and half the time at Sam's.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.492
- Yeah. So you lied.
- OK, Wait a second.

08:58.577 --> 09:00.454
You're expecting me to drive you

09:00.539 --> 09:03.294
to two places now
to have your picture taken?

09:03.503 --> 09:06.466
Because we did not discuss this.
And... and who is Heather?

09:06.718 --> 09:08.220
Heather... Heather Taylor?

09:08.304 --> 09:10.642
Yeah, she's like the most popular girl
in school.

09:10.726 --> 09:11.644
- Ooh.
- I guess, like,

09:11.728 --> 09:14.065
Anna's best friends
with her right now so...

09:14.149 --> 09:17.109
I'm actually not best friends with her.
She's just being really nice to me.

09:17.155 --> 09:18.490
- OK.
- So...

09:18.575 --> 09:19.803
- Whatever. It's fine.
- Can you stop?

09:19.827 --> 09:22.498
I'm not doing anything.
Stop telling me to stop.

15:24.848 --> 15:28.021
I just wanted to ask you something. Um...

15:29.023 --> 15:31.027
Just say it.

15:33.949 --> 15:35.870
Alex, will you dance with me?

15:38.542 --> 15:39.628
No.

15:45.765 --> 15:47.476
- Let's get out of here.
- All right.

15:56.244 --> 16:00.418
- What did you just say to Alex?
- Um, I just asked him to dance.

16:00.503 --> 16:04.135
- But he said no, so...
- That's so messed up.

16:04.594 --> 16:06.932
Thank you, guys. It's OK.
I'm OK, though, so...

16:07.099 --> 16:09.813
No, what's fucked up
is that you would do that to Heather.

16:09.896 --> 16:12.819
- She took you under her wing.
- And she didn't even want to.

16:13.821 --> 16:14.865
Tell her, Heather.

16:17.286 --> 16:22.171
My mom made me invite you,
because your parents were breaking up,

16:22.630 --> 16:27.139
and we wanted to be nice
and that's... just so you know.

16:48.933 --> 16:50.645
Flymiamibro22.

16:54.026 --> 16:55.028
What?

16:56.531 --> 16:57.575
It's me.

16:58.034 --> 17:00.038
I'm flymiamibro22.

17:01.207 --> 17:04.255
- What are you talking about?
- It's me.

17:06.718 --> 17:08.096
What have you done?

17:09.557 --> 17:11.185
- Oh, my God.
- Maya.

17:11.269 --> 17:12.437

I'm not UGIS, you fuck-butt.
Go fuck a dick till it comes, suck-face!

19:16.770 --> 19:18.649
Jesus, I was just kidding.

19:23.157 --> 19:24.661
You want me to finger you?

19:27.750 --> 19:31.550
- Yeah.
- Just, uh... meet me back there.

19:31.633 --> 19:32.969
Don't let anyone see you.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.848
- Oh, my God.
- 'Na, come with me.

19:34.931 --> 19:36.409
- It's all happening. It's all happening.
- No. No. Come with me.

19:36.433 --> 19:37.520
OK.

19:42.947 --> 19:44.742
Spooky in the dark.

19:49.376 --> 19:50.880
Stop.

19:53.175 --> 19:56.098
So, how do you wanna do this?

19:56.766 --> 19:59.479
Wait, hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

19:59.856 --> 20:02.068
- I don't wanna do finger.
- What?

20:02.152 --> 20:03.780
I don't wanna do finger.

20:04.991 --> 20:07.078
OK, can... can you do it?

20:07.705 --> 20:10.669
- Um... I'm like...
- Just, like, do it.

20:10.753 --> 20:15.011
- I... I don't know. I'm not, um, ready.
- Yo?

20:19.394 --> 20:21.566
- Um...
- Second base?

20:24.446 --> 20:25.950
Both of you?

20:29.081 --> 20:30.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:31.503 --> 20:35.426
- Cool.
- OK. Oh, my God.

20:56.636 --> 21:00.811
Is that good... rotation pattern?

21:06.071 --> 21:09.369
- You're both really hard-nipped.
- Thank you.

21:10.455 --> 21:11.457
You're welcome.

21:15.758 --> 21:18.220
- Don't tell anyone.
- Yeah.

21:19.306 --> 21:21.101
Wait at least a minute
before you come out.

21:21.185 --> 21:22.646
OK.

21:26.738 --> 21:28.282
I love you.

21:29.201 --> 21:30.871
I love you, too.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.879
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

21:39.514 --> 21:42.227
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

21:43.814 --> 21:46.485
Do you believe
that Sam is flymiamibro?

21:46.569 --> 21:48.782
Oh, my God. It's so crazy.

21:49.116 --> 21:51.036
But at least Alex didn't like
say no to you.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.667
Yeah, I know, but then, like,
Brandt said that thing to me,

21:53.750 --> 21:56.881
but then, like, I did the crazy thing,
and it felt, like, he was into it.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.844
And then that's why he then asked, like...

21:58.969 --> 22:00.096
Yeah.

22:01.098 --> 22:03.645
- I know.
- Wait. Anna.

22:04.522 --> 22:05.522
What?

22:06.568 --> 22:10.158
- We both got felt up for the first time.
- I know. Second base.

22:10.868 --> 22:14.584
- Together. Do you like him?
- I, like, love him.

22:15.669 --> 22:18.633
- Wait, do you like him?
- No, he's kind of an asshole.

22:19.176 --> 22:21.598
And he's best friends with Alex,
so it's just, like...

22:21.681 --> 22:24.562
Something didn't happen today with Alex,
but it could tomorrow,

22:24.812 --> 22:26.941
so I don't wanna complicate that.

22:28.778 --> 22:31.910
- I feel, like, older.
- I know. Me, too.

22:35.709 --> 22:38.047
I wonder when we'll get our periods.

22:41.053 --> 22:44.142
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

22:50.530 --> 22:52.325
Can I ask you a question?

22:53.410 --> 22:55.999
- Uh-huh.
- But you promise not to get mad.

22:57.878 --> 22:58.880
Yeah.

23:01.134 --> 23:03.264
Why did you tell Heather

23:03.347 --> 23:06.019
about your parents getting divorced
before me?

23:08.817 --> 23:12.031
- I called you first.
- No, you didn't.

23:12.533 --> 23:13.994
For your information, I did.

23:14.077 --> 23:15.998
I called you first,
and you didn't pick up.

23:16.415 --> 23:18.586
Then why didn't you leave a message?

23:20.256 --> 23:21.509
- Maya...
- What?

23:21.592 --> 23:23.304
That my parents are divorcing.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.351
- Yeah.
- And you were so mad at me that night.

23:26.936 --> 23:29.608
So I called Heather,
because she's the only person

23:29.692 --> 23:31.254
in our grade with parents
that are divorced.

23:31.278 --> 23:33.365
- Lie.
- What are you talking about?

23:33.449 --> 23:34.577
Terra Newback.

23:34.660 --> 23:36.539
- OK.
- Terra Newback's parents are divorced.

23:36.622 --> 23:38.250
OK, I didn't think about that.

23:38.835 --> 23:42.216
- I'm just saying, like...
- When you found out you were so weird

23:42.300 --> 23:43.511
you didn't even care.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.056
You didn't. You were, like...

23:45.682 --> 23:47.328
'Cause it's a huge deal,
and I shouldn't have

23:47.352 --> 23:49.272
found out that way. Like, are you serious?

23:49.356 --> 23:51.443
It's not about you! Are you serious, Maya?

23:51.527 --> 23:53.280
- It's not about you!
- OK, sorry!

23:53.364 --> 23:55.786
It's about me,
because it's the saddest thing

23:55.869 --> 23:58.583
that has ever happened to me.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.929
No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Stop!

24:05.262 --> 24:07.058
Come here. I'm sorry.

24:10.607 --> 24:12.151
I don't know what it's like.

24:14.447 --> 24:16.577
I could never know, and I'm sorry.

24:17.328 --> 24:21.128
- Parents are assholes.
- Yeah, they really are.

24:21.211 --> 24:23.883
That's all really. It's fine.

24:28.893 --> 24:29.937
Thanks.

24:33.110 --> 24:34.404
Wait.

24:46.888 --> 24:48.015
Oh, my God.

24:49.434 --> 24:50.896
Do you wanna take a walk?

24:53.233 --> 24:55.196
But, no, no, stop.

24:55.279 --> 24:57.116
We're just gonna do it, like...

24:57.325 --> 24:58.620
We're doing it.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.600
Listen to that.

25:32.144 --> 25:36.111
- Is that the wrong way?
- No, I think that's the right way.

25:38.490 --> 25:39.492
Right?

26:13.060 --> 26:14.563
I like it.

26:26.712 --> 26:28.423
You have to inhale.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.396
You're not inhaling.

26:38.151 --> 26:39.362
Are you OK?

26:51.219 --> 26:53.014
Do you wanna go inside?

26:54.518 --> 26:56.522
No, let's just stay out here.
