And then that's why he then asked, like...

338
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,096
Yeah.

339
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,645
- I know.
- Wait. Anna.

340
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:05,522
What?

341
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:10,158
- We both got felt up for the first time.
- I know. Second base.

342
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:14,584
- Together. Do you like him?
- I, like, love him.

343
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,633
- Wait, do you like him?
- No, he's kind of an asshole.

344
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:21,598
And he's best friends with Alex,
so it's just, like...

345
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:24,562
Something didn't happen today with Alex,
but it could tomorrow,

346
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,941
so I don't wanna complicate that.

347
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:31,910
- I feel, like, older.
- I know. Me, too.

348
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:38,047
I wonder when we'll get our periods.

349
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:44,142
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

350
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,325
Can I ask you a question?

351
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,999
- Uh-huh.
- But you promise not to get mad.

352
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:58,880
Yeah.

353
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:03,264
Why did you tell Heather

354
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:06,019
about your parents getting divorced
before me?

355
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:12,031
- I called you first.
- No, you didn't.

356
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:13,994
For your information, I did.

357
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:15,998
I called you first,
and you didn't pick up.

358
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:18,586
Then why didn't you leave a message?

[MAYA] What?

That my parents are divorcing.

361
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,351
- Yeah.
- And you were so mad at me that night.

362
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:29,608
So I called Heather,
because she's the only person

363
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:31,254
in our grade with parents
that are divorced.

364
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:33,365
- Lie.
- What are you talking about?

365
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:34,577
Terra Newback.

366
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,580
-OK.
-[MAYA] Terra Newback's parents
are divorced.

367
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,250
OK, I didn't think about that.

368
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:42,216
- I'm just saying, like...
- When you found out you were so weird

369
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,511
you didn't even care.

370
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,056
You didn't. You were, like...

00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:47,328
'Cause it's a huge deal,
and I shouldn't have

372
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:49,272
found out that way. Like, are you serious?

373
00:23:49,356 --> 00:23:51,443
It's not about you! Are you serious, Maya?

374
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:53,280
- It's not about you!
- OK, sorry!

375
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:55,786
It's about me,
because it's the saddest thing

376
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,583
that has ever happened to me.

377
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,929
No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Stop!

I could never know, and I'm sorry.

382
00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:21,128
- Parents are assholes.
- Yeah, they really are.

That's all really. It's fine.

But, no, no, stop.

We're doing it.

Listen to that.

392

- Is that the wrong way?
- No, I think that's the right way.

You're not inhaling.
