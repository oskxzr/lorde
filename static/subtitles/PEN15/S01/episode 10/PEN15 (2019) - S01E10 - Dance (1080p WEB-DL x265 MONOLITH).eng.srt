1
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,841
<i>Bye, Mom. Love you.</i>

2
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:07,513
<i>Is she OK?</i>

3
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:10,811
- She, like, didn't come down.
- That's OK.

4
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:15,613
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,575
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:20,957
Really?

7
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:23,754
Really, Dad.

8
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,324
You don't have any lingering questions
on your mind?

9
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:40,913
No, I mean...

10
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,715
I just think that probably
the hardest part

11
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:47,677
was when you and mom told me.

12
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:53,814
Um... but I think that it's ultimately

13
00:00:53,897 --> 00:00:55,568
gonna be the best for everyone honestly,

14
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,530
- because we could all use a breather...
- <i>We could all use a breather...</i>

15
00:00:57,613 --> 00:00:59,491
...from the recent hostility.

16
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:04,209
It's not like
things are gonna get any better.

17
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,802
<i>And maybe sometime,
after you guys take some space,</i>

18
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:11,516
you guys might wanna get back together
or something. I don't know.

19
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:14,856
Who knows.

20
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:16,777
Yeah.

21
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,323
Who knows.

22
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:34,562
<i>♪ I'm not a child ♪</i>

23
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:39,238
<i>♪ I'm just a woman ♪</i>

24
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:43,622
<i>♪ You don't have to be a girl anymore ♪</i>

25
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:45,333
Hey.

26
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:47,588
Hey.

27
00:01:52,598 --> 00:01:55,353
Sorry I yelled at you last night.

28
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:59,863
Yeah, I thought I'd hear from you.

29
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:04,329
Last night was just really shitty
and like...

30
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,421
Yeah, last night was really shitty
for me, too.

31
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,429
You know...

32
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,938
guess we just can't do everything together
like we thought.

33
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:21,363
I'm just saying "hey"
to Heather really quick.

34
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:26,457
- Hey.
- Hi, Anna.

35
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,877
Hey.

36
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:31,383
- Hey, um...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

37
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:32,845
No, it's not, it's fine.

38
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,518
I'm sorry about your parents' divorce.

39
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,231
- Oh, thanks.
- When my parents divorced,

40
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:41,403
it, like, sucked, but... you'll be fine.

41
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:45,119
- It's just hard to comprehend.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:45,203 --> 00:02:47,207
Yeah, I know it feels
like the world's ending, right?

43
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,756
Yeah, it... it really does,
and I'm, like, kind of in shock.

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,887
Mm-hmm. On the bright side,
you'll get two of everything.

45
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,937
- So I gotta go.
- OK. Bye. Oh, thanks.

46
00:02:58,396 --> 00:02:59,439
I'm OK.

47
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:10,546
<i>Good Morning, Trailview Middle.</i>

48
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:13,134
<i>It's 55 and partly cloudy.</i>

49
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:15,764
<i>Bring your coats tonight for the dance.</i>

50
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:17,977
<i>Remember our clothing rules,</i>

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,189
<i>nothing short, nothing tight,</i>

52
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:23,029
<i>we gonna dance till the morning light.</i>

53
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:39,937
Where's Anna?

54
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,693
I don't know.

55
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:44,572
She's over there.

56
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,369
The popular girls.

57
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:54,007
So she's sitting with them now?

58
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:57,055
It's really different.

59
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:59,393
Do you know that she told Heather
before she told me

60
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:00,938
that her parents are getting divorced?

61
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:04,444
- Can you believe that?
- OK.

62
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:07,492
I'm gonna tell you something, Maya.

63
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:11,458
- Just... don't freak out.
- Don't say anything to me right now.

64
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,672
What do you have to say? What? What?

65
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:18,389
All right. I heard a rumor that

66
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:22,147
Heather is taking Anna to the dance.

67
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,734
What? What did you say?

68
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,529
That was our plan
to go to the dance together.

69
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:27,616
We had a lot of plans tonight
so that's real...

70
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:31,415
Ho, ho, bitch. OK. OK.

71
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,048
Well, at least we're still going together.

72
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,851
I mean, together, as in like a group.

73
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:42,062
Hi, guys. Hey, Maya.

74
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,064
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey, Jenna.

75
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:44,609
Hey, Jeanine.

76
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:46,780
- It's Jenna.
- What?

77
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,577
- It's Jenna.
- That's what I said. "Hey, Jenna".

78
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,583
- Wassup.
- The sun.

79
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,338
JK.

80
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,588
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,287
- Hey.
- Hey.

82
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,372
Hi.

83
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:55,626
Is something wrong with the toilet?

84
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:58,422
No. No, you don't have to look.
That's not...

85
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:03,307
Uh, you know... you can't flush pads.

86
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:05,144
No, I know. That's not a pa...

87
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:06,396
- That's not mine.
- Mm.

88
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,192
'Cause I don't, I don't have my periods,

89
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:12,116
so I think that's someone
that put in there...

90
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:17,001
Uh, you know, it's... it's natural.
It happens to everyone.

91
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,757
Good for them.

92
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:25,936
Ahem. Here. For whenever.

93
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:32,156
Well, I don't need it,
so I'll find someone who does.

94
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:58,375
- Maya.
- What?

95
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,962
- Get off the computer!
- OK.

96
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,050
- Now!
- OK.

97
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,603
Hello. Ah!

98
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:10,817
It's your first shave before
your first dance. Are you two excited?

99
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:12,361
It's gonna be fun.

100
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:15,994
OK, this is a really big deal, girls.

101
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:18,750
Yeah. Once you start, you can never stop.

102
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:23,133
I just wanna make sure you know for sure
if you really want to start shaving.

103
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:26,974
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

104
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:28,393
- OK. OK.
- OK.

105
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:29,395
Yeah.

106
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,651
- Oh, you got me wet.
- I'm sorry.

107
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:32,736
Oh, it's OK.

108
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,451
You might bleed or cut,
so be careful.

109
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:40,417
Maya, don't shave over your knees.

110
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,465
- Mom...
- Always under and under your short pants.

111
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,595
Mom, they're called pedal pushers, like...

112
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:48,601
OK, whatever. Pedal pushers, OK?

113
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:00,917
Why are you looking at me
like that?

114
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,253
I'm not looking like you at anything.

115
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,428
What?

116
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:09,184
What time do you think
you're gonna be at Sam's?

117
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,576
Um, what time? I don't know.
I'm not that good at time.

118
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:20,874
Oh, really? 'Cause I feel,
like, you're usually,

119
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,132
like, always on time and good with time
and, like, keeping time.

120
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:29,975
- Why do you keep saying "time"?
- 'Cause, um...

121
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:35,528
I heard that you were invited to Heather's
to get ready at her house before.

122
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:43,920
Is that what you're gonna do?

123
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,095
No, I didn't say that.

124
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,474
I might take pictures

125
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:53,021
after this with Heather

126
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:56,779
and do half the time there
and half the time at Sam's.

127
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,492
- Yeah. So you lied.
- OK, Wait a second.

128
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:01,454
You're expecting me to drive you

129
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,294
to two places now
to have your picture taken?

130
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,466
Because we did not discuss this.
And... and who is Heather?

131
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,220
Heather... Heather Taylor?

132
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:11,642
Yeah, she's like the most popular girl
in school.

133
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:12,644
- Ooh.
- I guess, like,

134
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:15,065
Anna's best friends
with her right now so...

135
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,071
I'm actually not best friends with her.
She's just being really nice to me.

136
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:19,490
- OK.
- So...

137
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,744
- Whatever. It's fine.
- Can you stop?

138
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,498
I'm not doing anything.
Stop telling me to stop.

139
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,503
OK, everybody, time to get out.

140
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,049
Hey.

141
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:53,428
Hi. Sorry couldn't make it
to getting ready.

142
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:25,284
- Can you save me a dance?
- Oh, my God.

143
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,413
You look, like, super-different.

144
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:31,003
Um, can I...

145
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,417
Earth to Anna.

146
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,505
Circle back in 15.

147
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:05,322
You OK?

148
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,994
I just saw something. I wish I didn't.

149
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:09,497
Does it have something to do with me?

150
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,125
I can't say it, but, yeah.

151
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:16,427
Oh, my God, you keep looking at her.

152
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:18,557
Maya? No, I was looking at the, uh, wall.

153
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:20,603
Yeah. No, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

154
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:22,439
OK, you know what?
If you're so obsessed with her,

155
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:25,571
why don't you go dance with <i>her</i>
instead of me.

156
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:29,370
What, Jenna? Come on.

157
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,522
Ew.
Alex is over there.

158
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:44,776
Yeah, I know. I'm so over him.

159
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,283
- Yeah, right?
- No, like, for real. This time I am <i>done</i>.

160
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:51,623
But, like, what if you saw him dancing
with another girl tonight?

161
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:55,338
- Like, would <i>any</i> part of you care?
- Not at all.

162
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,556
But speaking of boys, you should see...

163
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:24,480
What's the deal with Jenna?

164
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:27,402
- I don't know. She's a drama queen.
- Yeah.

165
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:33,331
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

166
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:37,131
I'm sorry, that must be really hard.

167
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:41,430
'Cause you like...
you like her or whatever.

168
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:44,855
Yeah, it is. A little bit.

169
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:50,448
Do you want to dance?

170
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:54,833
Come on, Sam.

171
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,672
I'm sorry. That probably hurt.

172
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,016
Ow!

173
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:05,312
- Just kidding.
- OK.

174
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:11,658
So, like, do you?

175
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,623
What?

176
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:20,175
- Do you wanna dance?
- Like, whatever. Yeah, I guess.

177
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:51,905
OK.

178
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:54,703
Alex, will you dance with me?

179
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:05,933
Oh, my God.

180
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:11,193
Holy Jesus.

181
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,174
Wassup.

182
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:29,021
I just wanted to ask you something. Um...

183
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:32,027
Just say it.

184
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:36,870
Alex, will you dance with me?

185
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:40,628
No.

186
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:48,476
- Let's get out of here.
- All right.

187
00:15:57,244 --> 00:16:01,418
- What did you just say to Alex?
- Um, I just asked him to dance.

188
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:05,135
- But he said no, so...
- That's so messed up.

189
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,932
Thank you, guys. It's OK.
I'm OK, though, so...

190
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,813
No, what's fucked up
is that you would do that to Heather.

191
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:13,819
- She took you under her wing.
- And she didn't even want to.

192
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:15,865
Tell her, Heather.

193
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:23,171
My mom made me invite you,
because your parents were breaking up,

194
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,139
and we wanted to be nice
and that's... just so you know.

195
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,645
Flymiamibro22.

196
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:56,028
What?

197
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:58,575
It's me.

198
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:01,038
I'm flymiamibro22.

199
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,255
- What are you talking about?
- It's me.

200
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:09,096
What have you done?

201
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,185
- Oh, my God.
- Maya.

202
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,437
Excuse me.

203
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:24,449
Don't leave me.

204
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,672
Don't leave <i>me,</i> OK?

205
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:43,577
<i>You feelin' this, Trailview?</i>

206
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:49,547
<i>This is your last freak song,
middle schoolers.</i>

207
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,762
<i>So get your grind on.</i>

208
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,059
- Oh, my God. Who is it?
- Skyler.

209
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:58,732
- Skyler L or Skyler T?
- L.

210
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:07,666
- Who is that?
- Brendan.

211
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,547
Nice moves, UGIS.

212
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,099
I'm not UGIS, you fuck-butt.
Go fuck a dick till it comes, suck-face!

213
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,649
Jesus, I was just kidding.

214
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:25,661
You want me to finger you?

215
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,550
- Yeah.
- Just, uh... meet me back there.

216
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:33,969
Don't let anyone see you.

217
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:35,848
- Oh, my God.
- 'Na, come with me.

218
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:37,350
- It's all happening. It's all happening.
- No. No. Come with me.

219
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:38,520
OK.

220
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:45,742
Spooky in the dark.

221
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:51,880
Stop.

222
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:57,098
So, how do you wanna do this?

223
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:00,479
Wait, hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

224
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:03,068
- I don't wanna do finger.
- What?

225
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:04,780
I don't wanna do finger.

226
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:08,078
OK, can... can you do it?

227
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:11,669
- Um... I'm like...
- Just, like, do it.

228
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:16,011
- I... I don't know. I'm not, um, ready.
- Yo?

229
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:22,566
- Um...
- Second base?

230
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:26,950
Both of you?

231
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

232
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:36,426
- Cool.
- OK. Oh, my God.

233
00:20:57,636 --> 00:21:01,811
Is that good... rotation pattern?

234
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:10,369
- You're both really hard-nipped.
- Thank you.

235
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:12,457
You're welcome.

236
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:19,220
- Don't tell anyone.
- Yeah.

237
00:21:20,306 --> 00:21:22,101
Wait at least a minute
before you come out.

238
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:23,646
OK.

239
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:29,282
I love you.

240
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:31,871
I love you, too.

241
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,879
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

242
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:43,227
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

243
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:47,485
Do you believe
that Sam is flymiamibro?

244
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:49,782
Oh, my God. It's so crazy.

245
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:52,036
But at least Alex didn't like
say no to you.

246
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,667
Yeah, I know, but then, like,
Brandt said that thing to me,

247
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,881
but then, like, I did the crazy thing,
and it felt, like, he was into it.

248
00:21:57,965 --> 00:21:59,844
And then that's why he then asked, like...

249
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,096
Yeah.

250
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:04,645
- I know.
- Wait. Anna.

251
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:06,481
What?

252
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:11,158
- We both got felt up for the first time.
- I know. Second base.

253
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:15,584
- Together. Do you like him?
- I, like, love him.

254
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,633
- Wait, do you like him?
- No, he's kind of an asshole.

255
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:22,598
And he's best friends with Alex,
so it's just, like...

256
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:25,562
Something didn't happen today with Alex,
but it could tomorrow,

257
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,941
so I don't wanna complicate that.

258
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:32,910
- I feel, like, older.
- I know. Me, too.

259
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:39,047
I wonder when we'll get our periods.

260
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:45,142
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

261
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,325
Can I ask you a question?

262
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,999
- Uh-huh.
- But you promise not to get mad.

263
00:22:58,878 --> 00:22:59,880
Yeah.

264
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:04,264
Why did you tell Heather

265
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:07,019
about your parents getting divorced
before me?

266
00:23:09,817 --> 00:23:13,031
- I called you first.
- No, you didn't.

267
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:14,994
For your information, I did.

268
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:16,998
I called you first,
and you didn't pick up.

269
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:19,586
Then why didn't you leave a message?

270
00:23:21,256 --> 00:23:22,509
- Maya...
- What?

271
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:24,304
That my parents are divorcing.

272
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,351
- Yeah.
- And you were so mad at me that night.

273
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:30,608
So I called Heather,
because she's the only person

274
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:32,194
in our grade with parents
that are divorced.

275
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:34,365
- Lie.
- What are you talking about?

276
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:35,577
Terra Newback.

277
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,539
- OK.
- Terra Newback's parents are divorced.

278
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:39,250
OK, I didn't think about that.

279
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,216
- I'm just saying, like...
- When you found out you were so weird

280
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,511
you didn't even care.

281
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,056
You didn't. You were, like...

282
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:48,268
'Cause it's a huge deal,
and I shouldn't have

283
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:50,272
found out that way. Like, are you serious?

284
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:52,443
It's not about you! Are you serious, Maya?

285
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:54,280
- It's not about you!
- OK, sorry!

286
00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:56,786
It's about me,
because it's the saddest thing

287
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,583
that has ever happened to me.

288
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,929
No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Stop!

289
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:08,058
Come here. I'm sorry.

290
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:13,151
I don't know what it's like.

291
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:17,577
I could never know, and I'm sorry.

292
00:24:18,328 --> 00:24:22,128
- Parents are assholes.
- Yeah, they really are.

293
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,883
That's all really. It's fine.

294
00:24:29,893 --> 00:24:30,937
Thanks.

295
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,404
Wait.

296
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,015
Oh, my God.

297
00:24:50,434 --> 00:24:51,896
Do you wanna take a walk?

298
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:56,196
But, no, no, stop.

299
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,116
We're just gonna do it, like...

300
00:24:58,325 --> 00:24:59,620
We're doing it.

301
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,600
Listen to that.

302
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:37,111
- Is that the wrong way?
- No, I think that's the right way.

303
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,492
Right?

304
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,563
I like it.

305
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,423
You have to inhale.

306
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,396
You're not inhaling.

307
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:40,362
Are you OK?

308
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,014
Do you wanna go inside?

309
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:57,522
No, let's just stay out here.
