00:02.545 --> 00:04.841
<i>Bye, Mom. Love you.</i>

00:06.512 --> 00:07.513
<i>Is she OK?</i>

00:07.931 --> 00:10.811
- She, like, didn't come down.
- That's OK.

00:13.776 --> 00:15.613
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

00:16.239 --> 00:17.575
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

00:19.788 --> 00:20.957
Really?

00:22.502 --> 00:23.754
Really, Dad.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.324
You don't have any lingering questions
on your mind?

00:39.828 --> 00:40.913
No, I mean...

00:43.836 --> 00:45.715
I just think that probably
the hardest part

00:45.798 --> 00:47.677
was when you and mom told me.

00:48.846 --> 00:53.814
Um... but I think that it's ultimately

00:53.897 --> 00:55.568
gonna be the best for everyone honestly,

00:55.651 --> 00:57.530
- because we could all use a breather...
- <i>We could all use a breather...</i>

00:57.613 --> 00:59.491
...from the recent hostility.

01:00.828 --> 01:04.209
It's not like
things are gonna get any better.

01:05.921 --> 01:08.802
<i>And maybe sometime,
after you guys take some space,</i>

01:08.886 --> 01:11.516
you guys might wanna get back together
or something. I don't know.

01:13.562 --> 01:14.856
Who knows.

01:15.524 --> 01:16.777
Yeah.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.323
Who knows.

01:31.138 --> 01:34.562
<i>♪ I'm not a child ♪</i>

01:35.146 --> 01:39.238
<i>♪ I'm just a woman ♪</i>

01:39.614 --> 01:43.622
<i>♪ You don't have to be a girl anymore ♪</i>

01:44.123 --> 01:45.333
Hey.

01:46.335 --> 01:47.588
Hey.

01:52.598 --> 01:55.353
Sorry I yelled at you last night.

01:57.692 --> 01:59.863
Yeah, I thought I'd hear from you.

02:00.823 --> 02:04.329
Last night was just really shitty
and like...

02:05.290 --> 02:08.421
Yeah, last night was really shitty
for me, too.

02:11.051 --> 02:12.429
You know...

02:13.891 --> 02:16.938
guess we just can't do everything together
like we thought.

02:19.527 --> 02:21.363
I'm just saying "hey"
to Heather really quick.

02:24.954 --> 02:26.457
- Hey.
- Hi, Anna.

02:26.541 --> 02:27.877
Hey.

02:29.631 --> 02:31.383
- Hey, um...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

02:31.467 --> 02:32.845
No, it's not, it's fine.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.518
I'm sorry about your parents' divorce.

02:36.101 --> 02:38.231
- Oh, thanks.
- When my parents divorced,

02:38.314 --> 02:41.403
it, like, sucked, but... you'll be fine.

02:41.487 --> 02:45.119
- It's just hard to comprehend.
- Yeah.

02:45.203 --> 02:47.207
Yeah, I know it feels
like the world's ending, right?

02:47.290 --> 02:50.756
Yeah, it... it really does,
and I'm, like, kind of in shock.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.887
Mm-hmm. On the bright side,
you'll get two of everything.

02:54.221 --> 02:57.937
- So I gotta go.
- OK. Bye. Oh, thanks.

02:58.396 --> 02:59.439
I'm OK.

03:08.457 --> 03:10.546
<i>Good Morning, Trailview Middle.</i>

03:10.754 --> 03:13.134
<i>It's 55 and partly cloudy.</i>

03:13.217 --> 03:15.764
<i>Bring your coats tonight for the dance.</i>

03:16.015 --> 03:17.977
<i>Remember our clothing rules,</i>

03:18.060 --> 03:20.189
<i>nothing short, nothing tight,</i>

03:20.481 --> 03:23.029
<i>we gonna dance till the morning light.</i>

03:38.894 --> 03:39.937
Where's Anna?

03:41.650 --> 03:42.693
I don't know.

03:43.444 --> 03:44.572
She's over there.

03:45.741 --> 03:47.369
The popular girls.

03:52.337 --> 03:54.007
So she's sitting with them now?

03:55.426 --> 03:57.055
It's really different.

03:57.138 --> 03:59.393
Do you know that she told Heather
before she told me

03:59.476 --> 04:00.938
that her parents are getting divorced?

04:01.856 --> 04:04.444
- Can you believe that?
- OK.

04:05.196 --> 04:07.492
I'm gonna tell you something, Maya.

04:07.576 --> 04:11.458
- Just... don't freak out.
- Don't say anything to me right now.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.672
What do you have to say? What? What?

04:14.882 --> 04:18.389
All right. I heard a rumor that

04:18.472 --> 04:22.147
Heather is taking Anna to the dance.

04:22.230 --> 04:23.734
What? What did you say?

04:23.817 --> 04:25.529
That was our plan
to go to the dance together.

04:25.612 --> 04:27.616
We had a lot of plans tonight
so that's real...

04:28.242 --> 04:31.415
Ho, ho, bitch. OK. OK.

04:31.958 --> 04:35.048
Well, at least we're still going together.

04:38.722 --> 04:40.851
I mean, together, as in like a group.

04:41.101 --> 04:42.062
Hi, guys. Hey, Maya.

04:42.145 --> 04:43.064
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey, Jenna.

04:43.397 --> 04:44.609
Hey, Jeanine.

04:45.068 --> 04:46.780
- It's Jenna.
- What?

04:47.030 --> 04:49.577
- It's Jenna.
- That's what I said. "Hey, Jenna".

04:50.495 --> 04:52.583
- Wassup.
- The sun.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.338
JK.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.588
Oh, my God.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.287
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:53.370 --> 05:54.372
Hi.

05:54.582 --> 05:55.626
Is something wrong with the toilet?

05:55.709 --> 05:58.422
No. No, you don't have to look.
That's not...

05:59.842 --> 06:03.307
Uh, you know... you can't flush pads.

06:03.432 --> 06:05.144
No, I know. That's not a pa...

06:05.228 --> 06:06.396
- That's not mine.
- Mm.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.192
'Cause I don't, I don't have my periods,

06:08.275 --> 06:12.116
so I think that's someone
that put in there...

06:12.408 --> 06:17.001
Uh, you know, it's... it's natural.
It happens to everyone.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.757
Good for them.

06:22.387 --> 06:25.936
Ahem. Here. For whenever.

06:29.025 --> 06:32.156
Well, I don't need it,
so I'll find someone who does.

06:57.206 --> 06:58.375
- Maya.
- What?

06:58.459 --> 06:59.962
- Get off the computer!
- OK.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.050
- Now!
- OK.

07:05.891 --> 07:07.603
Hello. Ah!

07:07.686 --> 07:10.817
It's your first shave before
your first dance. Are you two excited?

07:11.318 --> 07:12.361
It's gonna be fun.

07:13.238 --> 07:15.994
OK, this is a really big deal, girls.

07:16.078 --> 07:18.750
Yeah. Once you start, you can never stop.

07:18.833 --> 07:23.133
I just wanna make sure you know for sure
if you really want to start shaving.

07:25.806 --> 07:26.974
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

07:27.058 --> 07:28.393
- OK. OK.
- OK.

07:28.477 --> 07:29.395
Yeah.

07:29.479 --> 07:31.651
- Oh, you got me wet.
- I'm sorry.

07:31.734 --> 07:32.736
Oh, it's OK.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.451
You might bleed or cut,
so be careful.

07:37.161 --> 07:40.417
Maya, don't shave over your knees.

07:40.459 --> 07:43.465
- Mom...
- Always under and under your short pants.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.595
Mom, they're called pedal pushers, like...

07:45.929 --> 07:48.601
OK, whatever. Pedal pushers, OK?

07:59.372 --> 08:00.917
Why are you looking at me
like that?

08:01.001 --> 08:02.253
I'm not looking like you at anything.

08:05.384 --> 08:06.428
What?

08:07.096 --> 08:09.184
What time do you think
you're gonna be at Sam's?

08:14.570 --> 08:17.576
Um, what time? I don't know.
I'm not that good at time.

08:18.745 --> 08:20.874
Oh, really? 'Cause I feel,
like, you're usually,

08:21.208 --> 08:25.132
like, always on time and good with time
and, like, keeping time.

08:26.677 --> 08:29.975
- Why do you keep saying "time"?
- 'Cause, um...

08:30.769 --> 08:35.528
I heard that you were invited to Heather's
to get ready at her house before.

08:42.834 --> 08:43.920
Is that what you're gonna do?

08:46.341 --> 08:48.095
No, I didn't say that.

08:48.178 --> 08:50.474
I might take pictures

08:51.184 --> 08:53.021
after this with Heather

08:53.105 --> 08:56.779
and do half the time there
and half the time at Sam's.

08:57.405 --> 08:59.492
- Yeah. So you lied.
- OK, Wait a second.

08:59.577 --> 09:01.454
You're expecting me to drive you

09:01.539 --> 09:04.294
to two places now
to have your picture taken?

09:04.503 --> 09:07.466
Because we did not discuss this.
And... and who is Heather?

09:07.718 --> 09:09.220
Heather... Heather Taylor?

09:09.304 --> 09:11.642
Yeah, she's like the most popular girl
in school.

09:11.726 --> 09:12.644
- Ooh.
- I guess, like,

09:12.728 --> 09:15.065
Anna's best friends
with her right now so...

09:15.149 --> 09:18.071
I'm actually not best friends with her.
She's just being really nice to me.

09:18.155 --> 09:19.490
- OK.
- So...

09:19.575 --> 09:20.744
- Whatever. It's fine.
- Can you stop?

09:20.827 --> 09:23.498
I'm not doing anything.
Stop telling me to stop.

09:23.583 --> 09:25.503
OK, everybody, time to get out.

10:49.963 --> 10:51.049
Hey.

10:51.132 --> 10:53.428
Hi. Sorry couldn't make it
to getting ready.

11:23.071 --> 11:25.284
- Can you save me a dance?
- Oh, my God.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.413
You look, like, super-different.

11:28.248 --> 11:31.003
Um, can I...

11:49.081 --> 11:50.417
Earth to Anna.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.505
Circle back in 15.

12:04.278 --> 12:05.322
You OK?

12:05.990 --> 12:07.994
I just saw something. I wish I didn't.

12:08.244 --> 12:09.497
Does it have something to do with me?

12:10.040 --> 12:11.125
I can't say it, but, yeah.

12:14.215 --> 12:16.427
Oh, my God, you keep looking at her.

12:16.553 --> 12:18.557
Maya? No, I was looking at the, uh, wall.

12:18.641 --> 12:20.603
Yeah. No, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

12:20.687 --> 12:22.439
OK, you know what?
If you're so obsessed with her,

12:22.524 --> 12:25.571
why don't you go dance with <i>her</i>
instead of me.

12:27.366 --> 12:29.370
What, Jenna? Come on.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.522
Ew.
Alex is over there.

12:42.605 --> 12:44.776
Yeah, I know. I'm so over him.

12:44.860 --> 12:48.283
- Yeah, right?
- No, like, for real. This time I am <i>done</i>.

12:48.743 --> 12:51.623
But, like, what if you saw him dancing
with another girl tonight?

12:51.707 --> 12:55.338
- Like, would <i>any</i> part of you care?
- Not at all.

12:56.090 --> 12:59.556
But speaking of boys, you should see...

13:22.685 --> 13:24.480
What's the deal with Jenna?

13:25.023 --> 13:27.402
- I don't know. She's a drama queen.
- Yeah.

13:31.494 --> 13:33.331
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

13:34.835 --> 13:37.131
I'm sorry, that must be really hard.

13:37.507 --> 13:41.430
'Cause you like...
you like her or whatever.

13:42.349 --> 13:44.855
Yeah, it is. A little bit.

13:48.946 --> 13:50.448
Do you want to dance?

13:53.204 --> 13:54.833
Come on, Sam.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.672
I'm sorry. That probably hurt.

14:01.387 --> 14:03.016
Ow!

14:03.349 --> 14:05.312
- Just kidding.
- OK.

14:09.946 --> 14:11.658
So, like, do you?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.623
What?

14:15.248 --> 14:20.175
- Do you wanna dance?
- Like, whatever. Yeah, I guess.

14:50.528 --> 14:51.905
OK.

14:53.032 --> 14:54.703
Alex, will you dance with me?

15:04.471 --> 15:05.933
Oh, my God.

15:09.314 --> 15:11.193
Holy Jesus.

15:20.838 --> 15:22.174
Wassup.

15:25.848 --> 15:29.021
I just wanted to ask you something. Um...

15:30.023 --> 15:32.027
Just say it.

15:34.949 --> 15:36.870
Alex, will you dance with me?

15:39.542 --> 15:40.628
No.

15:46.765 --> 15:48.476
- Let's get out of here.
- All right.

15:57.244 --> 16:01.418
- What did you just say to Alex?
- Um, I just asked him to dance.

16:01.503 --> 16:05.135
- But he said no, so...
- That's so messed up.

16:05.594 --> 16:07.932
Thank you, guys. It's OK.
I'm OK, though, so...

16:08.099 --> 16:10.813
No, what's fucked up
is that you would do that to Heather.

16:10.896 --> 16:13.819
- She took you under her wing.
- And she didn't even want to.

16:14.821 --> 16:15.865
Tell her, Heather.

16:18.286 --> 16:23.171
My mom made me invite you,
because your parents were breaking up,

16:23.630 --> 16:28.139
and we wanted to be nice
and that's... just so you know.

16:49.933 --> 16:51.645
Flymiamibro22.

16:55.026 --> 16:56.028
What?

16:57.531 --> 16:58.575
It's me.

16:59.034 --> 17:01.038
I'm flymiamibro22.

17:02.207 --> 17:05.255
- What are you talking about?
- It's me.

17:07.718 --> 17:09.096
What have you done?

17:10.557 --> 17:12.185
- Oh, my God.
- Maya.

17:12.269 --> 17:13.437
Excuse me.

18:23.197 --> 18:24.449
Don't leave me.

18:26.417 --> 18:28.672
Don't leave <i>me,</i> OK?

18:41.071 --> 18:43.577
<i>You feelin' this, Trailview?</i>

18:46.457 --> 18:49.547
<i>This is your last freak song,
middle schoolers.</i>

18:49.630 --> 18:52.762
<i>So get your grind on.</i>

18:53.429 --> 18:56.059
- Oh, my God. Who is it?
- Skyler.

18:56.143 --> 18:58.732
- Skyler L or Skyler T?
- L.

19:05.036 --> 19:07.666
- Who is that?
- Brendan.

19:09.252 --> 19:10.547
Nice moves, UGIS.

19:11.340 --> 19:16.099
I'm not UGIS, you fuck-butt.
Go fuck a dick till it comes, suck-face!

19:17.770 --> 19:19.649
Jesus, I was just kidding.

19:24.157 --> 19:25.661
You want me to finger you?

19:28.750 --> 19:32.550
- Yeah.
- Just, uh... meet me back there.

19:32.633 --> 19:33.969
Don't let anyone see you.

19:34.302 --> 19:35.848
- Oh, my God.
- 'Na, come with me.

19:35.931 --> 19:37.350
- It's all happening. It's all happening.
- No. No. Come with me.

19:37.433 --> 19:38.520
OK.

19:43.947 --> 19:45.742
Spooky in the dark.

19:50.376 --> 19:51.880
Stop.

19:54.175 --> 19:57.098
So, how do you wanna do this?

19:57.766 --> 20:00.479
Wait, hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

20:00.856 --> 20:03.068
- I don't wanna do finger.
- What?

20:03.152 --> 20:04.780
I don't wanna do finger.

20:05.991 --> 20:08.078
OK, can... can you do it?

20:08.705 --> 20:11.669
- Um... I'm like...
- Just, like, do it.

20:11.753 --> 20:16.011
- I... I don't know. I'm not, um, ready.
- Yo?

20:20.394 --> 20:22.566
- Um...
- Second base?

20:25.446 --> 20:26.950
Both of you?

20:30.081 --> 20:31.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:32.503 --> 20:36.426
- Cool.
- OK. Oh, my God.

20:57.636 --> 21:01.811
Is that good... rotation pattern?

21:07.071 --> 21:10.369
- You're both really hard-nipped.
- Thank you.

21:11.455 --> 21:12.457
You're welcome.

21:16.758 --> 21:19.220
- Don't tell anyone.
- Yeah.

21:20.306 --> 21:22.101
Wait at least a minute
before you come out.

21:22.185 --> 21:23.646
OK.

21:27.738 --> 21:29.282
I love you.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.871
I love you, too.

21:33.290 --> 21:35.879
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

21:40.514 --> 21:43.227
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

21:44.814 --> 21:47.485
Do you believe
that Sam is flymiamibro?

21:47.569 --> 21:49.782
Oh, my God. It's so crazy.

21:50.116 --> 21:52.036
But at least Alex didn't like
say no to you.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.667
Yeah, I know, but then, like,
Brandt said that thing to me,

21:54.750 --> 21:57.881
but then, like, I did the crazy thing,
and it felt, like, he was into it.

21:57.965 --> 21:59.844
And then that's why he then asked, like...

21:59.969 --> 22:01.096
Yeah.

22:02.098 --> 22:04.645
- I know.
- Wait. Anna.

22:05.522 --> 22:06.481
What?

22:07.568 --> 22:11.158
- We both got felt up for the first time.
- I know. Second base.

22:11.868 --> 22:15.584
- Together. Do you like him?
- I, like, love him.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.633
- Wait, do you like him?
- No, he's kind of an asshole.

22:20.176 --> 22:22.598
And he's best friends with Alex,
so it's just, like...

22:22.681 --> 22:25.562
Something didn't happen today with Alex,
but it could tomorrow,

22:25.812 --> 22:27.941
so I don't wanna complicate that.

22:29.778 --> 22:32.910
- I feel, like, older.
- I know. Me, too.

22:36.709 --> 22:39.047
I wonder when we'll get our periods.

22:42.053 --> 22:45.142
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

22:51.530 --> 22:53.325
Can I ask you a question?

22:54.410 --> 22:56.999
- Uh-huh.
- But you promise not to get mad.

22:58.878 --> 22:59.880
Yeah.

23:02.134 --> 23:04.264
Why did you tell Heather

23:04.347 --> 23:07.019
about your parents getting divorced
before me?

23:09.817 --> 23:13.031
- I called you first.
- No, you didn't.

23:13.533 --> 23:14.994
For your information, I did.

23:15.077 --> 23:16.998
I called you first,
and you didn't pick up.

23:17.415 --> 23:19.586
Then why didn't you leave a message?

23:21.256 --> 23:22.509
- Maya...
- What?

23:22.592 --> 23:24.304
That my parents are divorcing.

23:24.680 --> 23:27.351
- Yeah.
- And you were so mad at me that night.

23:27.936 --> 23:30.608
So I called Heather,
because she's the only person

23:30.692 --> 23:32.194
in our grade with parents
that are divorced.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.365
- Lie.
- What are you talking about?

23:34.449 --> 23:35.577
Terra Newback.

23:35.660 --> 23:37.539
- OK.
- Terra Newback's parents are divorced.

23:37.622 --> 23:39.250
OK, I didn't think about that.

23:39.835 --> 23:43.216
- I'm just saying, like...
- When you found out you were so weird

23:43.300 --> 23:44.511
you didn't even care.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.056
You didn't. You were, like...

23:46.682 --> 23:48.268
'Cause it's a huge deal,
and I shouldn't have

23:48.352 --> 23:50.272
found out that way. Like, are you serious?

23:50.356 --> 23:52.443
It's not about you! Are you serious, Maya?

23:52.527 --> 23:54.280
- It's not about you!
- OK, sorry!

23:54.364 --> 23:56.786
It's about me,
because it's the saddest thing

23:56.869 --> 23:59.583
that has ever happened to me.

24:03.340 --> 24:05.929
No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Stop!

24:06.262 --> 24:08.058
Come here. I'm sorry.

24:11.607 --> 24:13.151
I don't know what it's like.

24:15.447 --> 24:17.577
I could never know, and I'm sorry.

24:18.328 --> 24:22.128
- Parents are assholes.
- Yeah, they really are.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.883
That's all really. It's fine.

24:29.893 --> 24:30.937
Thanks.

24:34.110 --> 24:35.404
Wait.

24:47.888 --> 24:49.015
Oh, my God.

24:50.434 --> 24:51.896
Do you wanna take a walk?

24:54.233 --> 24:56.196
But, no, no, stop.

24:56.279 --> 24:58.116
We're just gonna do it, like...

24:58.325 --> 24:59.620
We're doing it.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.600
Listen to that.

25:33.144 --> 25:37.111
- Is that the wrong way?
- No, I think that's the right way.

25:39.490 --> 25:40.492
Right?

26:14.060 --> 26:15.563
I like it.

26:27.712 --> 26:29.423
You have to inhale.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.396
You're not inhaling.

26:39.151 --> 26:40.362
Are you OK?

26:52.219 --> 26:54.014
Do you wanna go inside?

26:55.518 --> 26:57.522
No, let's just stay out here.
