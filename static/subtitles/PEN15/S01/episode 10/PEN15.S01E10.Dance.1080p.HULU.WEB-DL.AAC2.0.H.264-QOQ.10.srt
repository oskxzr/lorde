1
00:00:01,545 --> 00:00:03,841
<i>Bye, Mom. Love you.</i>

2
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:06,513
<i>Is she OK?</i>

3
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:09,811
- She, like, didn't come down.
- That's OK.

4
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:14,613
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:16,575
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:19,957
Really?

7
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:22,754
Really, Dad.

8
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:37,324
You don't have any lingering questions
on your mind?

9
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:39,913
No, I mean...

10
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:44,715
I just think that probably
the hardest part

11
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:46,677
was when you and mom told me.

12
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:52,814
Um... but I think that it's ultimately

13
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:54,568
gonna be the best for everyone honestly,

14
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,589
- because we could all use a breather...
- <i>We could all use a breather...</i>

15
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:58,491
from the recent hostility.

16
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:03,209
It's not like
things are gonna get any better.

17
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:07,802
<i>And maybe sometime,
after you guys take some space,</i>

18
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:10,516
you guys might wanna get back together
or something. I don't know.

19
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:13,856
Who knows.

20
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:15,777
Yeah.

21
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:18,323
Who knows.

22
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:33,562
<i>♪ I'm not a child ♪</i>

23
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:38,238

25
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,333
Hey.

26
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:46,588
Hey.

27
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:54,353
Sorry I yelled at you last night.

28
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,863
Yeah, I thought I'd hear from you.

29
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:03,329
Last night was just really shitty
and like...

30
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,421
Yeah, last night was really shitty
for me, too.

31
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:11,429
You know...

32
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,938
guess we just can't do everything together
like we thought.

33
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:20,363
I'm just saying "hey"
to Heather really quick.

34
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:25,457
- Hey.
- Hi, Anna.

35
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,877
Hey.

36
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,383
- Hey, um...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

37
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:31,845
No, it's not, it's fine.

38
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,518
I'm sorry about your parents' divorce.

39
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,231
- Oh, thanks.
- When my parents divorced,

40
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:40,403
it, like, sucked, but... you'll be fine.

41
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:44,119
- It's just hard to comprehend.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,266
Yeah, I know it feels
like the world's ending, right?

43
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,756
Yeah, it... it really does,
and I'm, like, kind of in shock.

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,887
Mm-hmm. On the bright side,
you'll get two of everything.

45
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:56,937
- So I gotta go.
- OK. Bye. Oh, thanks.

46
00:02:57,396 --> 00:02:58,439
I'm OK.

47
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,546
<i>Good Morning, Trailview Middle.</i>

48
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:12,134
<i>It's 55 and partly cloudy.</i>

49
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:14,764
<i>Bring your coats tonight for the dance.</i>

50
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:16,977
<i>Remember our clothing rules,</i>

51
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,189
<i>nothing short, nothing tight,</i>

52
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,029
<i>we gonna dance till the morning light.</i>

53
00:03:37,894 --> 00:03:38,937
Where's Anna?

54
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,693
I don't know.

55
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:43,572
She's over there.

56
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,369
The popular girls.

57
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:53,007
So she's sitting with them now?

58
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:56,055
It's really different.

59
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:58,393
Do you know that she told Heather
before she told me

60
00:03:58,476 --> 00:03:59,996
that her parents are getting divorced?

61
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:03,444
- Can you believe that?
- OK.

62
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:06,492
I'm gonna tell you something, Maya.

63
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:10,458
- Just... don't freak out.
- Don't say anything to me right now.

64
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,672
What do you have to say? What? What?

65
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:17,389
All right. I heard a rumor that

66
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:21,147
Heather is taking Anna to the dance.

67
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,734
What? What did you say?

68
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,588
That was our plan
to go to the dance together.

69
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,616
We had a lot of plans tonight
so that's real...

70
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:30,415
Ho, ho, bitch. OK. OK.

71
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,048
Well, at least we're still going together.

72
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:39,851
I mean, together, as in like a group.

73
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,101
Hi, guys. Hey, Maya.

74
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:42,185
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey, Jenna.

75
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:43,609
Hey, Jeanine.

76
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:45,780
- It's Jenna.
- What?

77
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,577
- It's Jenna.
- That's what I said. "Hey, Jenna".

78
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:51,583
- Wassup.
- The sun.

79
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,338
JK.

80
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,588
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,287
- Hey.
- Hey.

82
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,372
Hi.

83
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:54,685
Is something wrong with the toilet?

84
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,422
No. No, you don't have to look.
That's not...

85
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:02,307
Uh, you know... you can't flush pads.

86
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:04,144
No, I know. That's not a pa...

87
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,396
- That's not mine.
- Mm.

88
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,192
'Cause I don't, I don't have my periods,

89
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:11,116
so I think that's someone
that put in there...

90
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:16,001
Uh, you know, it's... it's natural.
It happens to everyone.

91
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,757
Good for them.

92
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:24,936
Ahem. Here. For whenever.

93
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:31,156
Well, I don't need it,
so I'll find someone who does.

94
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,375
- Maya.
- What?

95
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,962
- Get off the computer!
- OK.

96
00:06:59,254 --> 00:07:01,050
- Now!
- OK.

97
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,603
Hello. Ah!

98
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:09,817
It's your first shave before
your first dance. Are you two excited?

99
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:11,361
It's gonna be fun.

100
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:14,994
OK, this is a really big deal, girls.

101
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:17,750
Yeah. Once you start, you can never stop.

102
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:22,133
I just wanna make sure you know for sure
if you really want to start shaving.

103
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:25,974
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

104
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:27,393
- OK. OK.
- OK.

105
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:28,395
Yeah.

106
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,651
- Oh, you got me wet.
- I'm sorry.

107
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:31,736
Oh, it's OK.

108
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,451
You might bleed or cut,
so be careful.

109
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:39,417
Maya, don't shave over your knees.

110
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,465
- Mom...
- Always under and under your short pants.

111
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,595
Mom, they're called pedal pushers, like...

112
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:47,601
OK, whatever. Pedal pushers, OK?

113
00:07:58,372 --> 00:07:59,917
Why are you looking at me
like that?

114
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,481
I'm not looking like you at anything.

115
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,428
What?

116
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:08,184
What time do you think
you're gonna be at Sam's?

117
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,576
Um, what time? I don't know.
I'm not that good at time.

118
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:19,874
Oh, really? 'Cause I feel,
like, you're usually,

119
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,132
like, always on time and good with time
and, like, keeping time.

120
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:28,975
- Why do you keep saying "time"?
- 'Cause, um...

121
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:34,528
I heard that you were invited to Heather's
to get ready at her house before.

122
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:42,994
Is that what you're gonna do?

123
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:47,095
No, I didn't say that.

124
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:49,474
I might take pictures

125
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:52,021
after this with Heather

126
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:55,779
and do half the time there
and half the time at Sam's.

127
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,492
- Yeah. So you lied.
- OK, Wait a second.

128
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:00,454
You're expecting me to drive you

129
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,294
to two places now
to have your picture taken?

130
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:06,466
Because we did not discuss this.
And... and who is Heather?

131
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:08,220
Heather... Heather Taylor?

132
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,642
Yeah, she's like the most popular girl
in school.

133
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:11,644
- Ooh.
- I guess, like,

134
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:14,065
Anna's best friends
with her right now so...

135
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,109
I'm actually not best friends with her.
She's just being really nice to me.

136
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:18,490
- OK.
- So...

137
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:19,803
- Whatever. It's fine.
- Can you stop?

138
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,498
I'm not doing anything.
Stop telling me to stop.

139
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,503

291
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:18,220

- Yeah.

292
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:21,101

293
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:22,646

that Sam is flymiamibro?

299
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:48,782
Oh, my God. It's so crazy.

300
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:51,036
But at least Alex didn't like
say no to you.

301
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,667
Yeah, I know, but then, like,
Brandt said that thing to me,

302
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,881
but then, like, I did the crazy thing,
and it felt, like, he was into it.

303
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,844
And then that's why he then asked, like...

304
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,096
Yeah.

305
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,645
- I know.
- Wait. Anna.

306
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:05,522
What?

307
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:10,158
- We both got felt up for the first time.
- I know. Second base.

308
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:14,584
- Together. Do you like him?
- I, like, love him.

309
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,633
- Wait, do you like him?
- No, he's kind of an asshole.

310
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:21,598
And he's best friends with Alex,
so it's just, like...

311
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:24,562
Something didn't happen today with Alex,
but it could tomorrow,

312
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,941
so I don't wanna complicate that.

313
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:31,910
- I feel, like, older.
- I know. Me, too.

314
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:38,047
I wonder when we'll get our periods.

315
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:44,142
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

316
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,325
Can I ask you a question?

317
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,999
- Uh-huh.
- But you promise not to get mad.

318
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:58,880
Yeah.

319
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:03,264
Why did you tell Heather

320
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:06,019
about your parents getting divorced
before me?

321
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:12,031
- I called you first.
- No, you didn't.

322
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:13,994
For your information, I did.

323
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:15,998
I called you first,
and you didn't pick up.

324
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:18,586
Then why didn't you leave a message?

325
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:21,509
- Maya...
- What?

326
00:23:21,592 --> 00:23:23,304
That my parents are divorcing.

327
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,351
- Yeah.
- And you were so mad at me that night.

328
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:29,608
So I called Heather,
because she's the only person

329
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:31,254
in our grade with parents
that are divorced.

330
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:33,365
- Lie.
- What are you talking about?

331
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:34,577
Terra Newback.

332
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,539
- OK.
- Terra Newback's parents are divorced.

333
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,250
OK, I didn't think about that.

334
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:42,216
- I'm just saying, like...
- When you found out you were so weird

335
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,511
you didn't even care.

336
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,056
You didn't. You were, like...

337
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:47,328
'Cause it's a huge deal,
and I shouldn't have

338
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:49,272
found out that way. Like, are you serious?

339
00:23:49,356 --> 00:23:51,443
It's not about you! Are you serious, Maya?

340
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:53,280
- It's not about you!
- OK, sorry!

341
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:55,786
It's about me,
because it's the saddest thing

342
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,583
that has ever happened to me.

343
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,929
No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Stop!

344
00:24:05,262 --> 00:24:07,058
Come here. I'm sorry.

345
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:12,151
I don't know what it's like.

346
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:16,577
I could never know, and I'm sorry.

347
00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:21,128
- Parents are assholes.
- Yeah, they really are.

348
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,883
That's all really. It's fine.

349
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:29,937
Thanks.

350
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,404
Wait.

351
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:48,015
Oh, my God.

352
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:50,896
Do you wanna take a walk?

353
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,196
But, no, no, stop.

354
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,116
We're just gonna do it, like...

355
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:58,620
We're doing it.

356
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,600
Listen to that.

357
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:36,111
- Is that the wrong way?
- No, I think that's the right way.

358
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,492
Right?

359
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,563
I like it.

360
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,423
You have to inhale.

361
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,396
You're not inhaling.

362
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:39,362
Are you OK?

363
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,014
Do you wanna go inside?

364
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:56,522
No, let's just stay out here.
