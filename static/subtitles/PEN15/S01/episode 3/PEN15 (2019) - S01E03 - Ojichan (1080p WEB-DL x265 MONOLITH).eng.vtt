Maya Chan,
did you brush your teeth?

01:38.935 --> 01:40.855
Yeah, I'm in bed! I'm asleep now!

01:49.372 --> 01:51.501
I love you.

01:52.796 --> 01:54.423
- I love you.
- Let me turn the light off.

01:54.507 --> 01:56.094
No, no, can you leave that on?

01:57.263 --> 01:59.685
OK. All right.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.866
Hurry up dummy!

02:49.950 --> 02:53.247
- We're gonna be late for school!
- It's my bathroom, too! Shut up!

02:53.373 --> 02:55.878
What are you doing in there?
Shaving your back?

02:56.838 --> 03:01.640
You can't just barge in!
I was brushing my teeth!

03:01.723 --> 03:06.190
There is no privacy
in this house!

03:23.349 --> 03:24.978
- Good morning.
- Morning.

03:25.270 --> 03:27.482
Is it just me,
or it's super dry last night?

03:27.566 --> 03:29.069
My nostrils are crusty.

03:33.327 --> 03:34.956
This is too strong, again.

03:36.208 --> 03:39.924
- It's a light roast.
- Light roasts are stronger, Curtis.

03:40.008 --> 03:43.682
You know I don't like it strong
and yet you continue to make it strong.

03:43.766 --> 03:46.772
- It's Peruvian.
- Yeah, well, it tastes like shit.

03:47.774 --> 03:51.280
- OK, I'm gonna go. Love you. Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

03:53.952 --> 03:55.790
Just use more cream, like...

03:56.666 --> 03:59.171
- OK, thank you. I-I love you.
- OK, thanks. Love you.

03:59.254 --> 04:00.800
- I got to go.
- Have a good day at school.

04:04.223 --> 04:05.810

04:07.062 --> 04:09.399
We're discussing The Hero's Journey.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.820

04:10.903 --> 04:13.241
Um, what are we gonna do this weekend?

04:13.992 --> 04:15.704
Like I really want it to be fun.

04:15.788 --> 04:19.211
- Yeah. Fun.
- <i>Do you wanna go see, like a movie,</i>

04:19.671 --> 04:21.507
<i>or something. That would be fun.</i>

04:27.227 --> 04:29.106

04:36.036 --> 04:36.997

- Maya.
- Yeah. What?

04:53.070 --> 04:56.076
- You're not listening, obviously.
- Yes, I am.

04:58.707 --> 05:00.753
Um, I got to <i>poo.</i>

05:01.922 --> 05:02.965
OK, let's go.

05:03.967 --> 05:07.140
Or actually,
can... can I go in there alone this time

05:07.224 --> 05:09.061
'cause I kinda want some privacy.

05:09.353 --> 05:11.148
Oh, yeah. You're your own person.

05:11.232 --> 05:12.652
- OK. Thanks.
- You just always

05:12.735 --> 05:13.779
want me to go in there with you.

05:13.862 --> 05:15.658
Yeah, I know,
it's just gonna be like, a nasty one.

05:15.741 --> 05:17.118
So, I don't wanna put you
through that, you know.

05:17.202 --> 05:18.872
It's OK.
I'll just breathe through my mouth.

05:19.081 --> 05:22.797
OK, or can you just, like keep watch
outside, and that, so, no one can come in?

05:24.007 --> 05:24.884
OK.

- Wow, that's so, like... specific.

07:32.890 --> 07:35.353
Hey, Sam, is it weird
to see your mom on screen?

07:35.812 --> 07:39.027
- Do you stay hard?
- Fuck you. I stay hard 24/7.

07:39.110 --> 07:43.327
Are you guys, like talking about,
like masturbating, or...

07:43.410 --> 07:45.373
Yeah, Maya. Just ignore them.
Like, they're pervs.

07:45.456 --> 07:47.001
It's just porn, dork.

07:47.085 --> 07:49.422

17:36.888 --> 17:38.349
<i>What's your favorite radio station?</i>

17:38.726 --> 17:41.313
<i>Overhead, Q102!</i>

17:51.542 --> 17:52.879
Mommy!

17:53.421 --> 17:57.722
- What's wrong?
- It's <i>Ojichan</i>! I see <i>Ojichan</i>!

17:58.222 --> 18:00.602
That's nice. Say hello.

18:03.065 --> 18:04.193
Sorry.

18:04.443 --> 18:07.617
I didn't mean to do that. I wasn't doing
what you think I was doing.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.328
I was just scratching.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.298
Go away, please! Go away!

18:22.437 --> 18:27.155
<i>The Gobi desert is amongst
the driest places in the world.</i>

18:37.885 --> 18:38.762
Na?

18:41.893 --> 18:42.770
Na?

18:47.571 --> 18:48.699
Are you mad at me?

18:50.451 --> 18:52.122
Why weren't you in carpool this morning?

18:53.499 --> 18:55.796
'Cause I, like slept in.

18:56.422 --> 18:58.301
- Oh, really? Oh.
- Yeah.

18:58.551 --> 18:59.929
- Guess what?
- What?

19:00.013 --> 19:02.810
I went to Sam's
and you weren't there. You liar.

19:05.273 --> 19:08.780
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Busted buddy.

19:12.622 --> 19:13.707
Na.

19:14.291 --> 19:18.174
- Na, listen. OK.
- I'm trying to watch the video.

19:33.997 --> 19:36.085
Go away. Go away.

19:45.896 --> 19:46.815
Na.

19:48.317 --> 19:51.281
- Na. Listen.
- I already told you, I'm trying to...

19:51.658 --> 19:55.039
I'm sorry, I lied, OK?
That was really messed up.

19:55.456 --> 19:58.212
But I'm doing it because I am hiding
something about me

19:58.295 --> 20:01.301
that has nothing to do with you.
I swear on my life.

20:01.720 --> 20:02.972
Will you listen?

20:04.141 --> 20:05.143
What?

20:08.566 --> 20:10.153
I see dead people.

20:14.327 --> 20:17.167
Oh. I, like, see ghosts all the time.

20:18.085 --> 20:19.672
- For real?
- Yeah.

20:20.298 --> 20:21.634
Who do you see?

20:24.347 --> 20:26.018
I see my <i>Ojichan</i>.

20:27.312 --> 20:28.690
What is an <i>Ojichan</i>?

20:29.024 --> 20:31.821
- It's my grandpa. Yeah.
- Oh.

20:31.905 --> 20:35.913
And it's like really freaky.
I'm not kidding.

20:40.338 --> 20:41.590
I have an idea.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.808
Spirit, show yourself.

20:45.891 --> 20:48.605
Spirit, reveal.

20:48.688 --> 20:53.824
Spirit, show yourself,
so, Maya knows you're real.

20:55.702 --> 20:58.332
I think he's here.

20:58.499 --> 20:59.669
Oh, my God.

21:00.586 --> 21:02.298
I don't know I could be wrong,
I just feel it.

21:03.092 --> 21:04.929
- OK, so, put your hands on it.
- OK.

21:07.852 --> 21:09.020
<i>Ojichan</i>...

21:10.691 --> 21:11.901
are you here?

21:15.701 --> 21:17.955
- Don't move it. OK, I'm not.
- I'm not.

21:18.414 --> 21:19.541
<i>Ojichan</i>...

21:20.836 --> 21:21.880
are you here?

21:24.802 --> 21:27.850
- Oh, my God. Are you moving it? God!
- I'm not moving it. Are you moving it?

21:28.434 --> 21:31.481
OK, that's crazy!

21:31.565 --> 21:33.360
- I don't want to do this.
- It's OK. Put your hands back.

21:33.444 --> 21:34.321
I'm with you.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.158
Put your hands on it.

21:39.539 --> 21:40.416
<i>Ojichan</i>...

21:41.084 --> 21:42.212
why are you here?

21:43.589 --> 21:45.636
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

21:46.930 --> 21:47.932
C...

21:51.814 --> 21:53.442
L...

21:55.739 --> 21:56.824
I...

21:59.664 --> 22:01.250
T...

22:05.801 --> 22:10.059
T, C-L-I-T, clit.

22:14.902 --> 22:15.988
Clit.

22:16.571 --> 22:18.827
- Clit.
- Clit.

22:20.246 --> 22:22.876
- I don't know what clit.
- I don't know clit.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.676
- Eww.
- Eww.

22:27.218 --> 22:28.680
- Clit!
- Clit!

22:29.640 --> 22:30.726
- Maya!
- Anna!

22:30.809 --> 22:32.145
- You're doing that.
- I'm not.

22:32.228 --> 22:33.522
I was not touching.

22:33.606 --> 22:35.610
I swear on my life, I'm not moving it.

22:35.694 --> 22:37.948
- You're moving it.
- My fingers are barely touching it.

22:38.032 --> 22:39.034
OK, well, same.

22:41.163 --> 22:42.791
Why is your grandpa saying "clit"?

22:44.336 --> 22:47.133
I don't know. Maybe it's not him.

22:47.216 --> 22:48.928
- It's him for sure.
- It is.

22:50.807 --> 22:53.688
- I can feel him.
- I don't know, now, I feel like...

22:54.732 --> 22:57.070
- this is crazy...
- Maya, let's just try one more time.

22:57.153 --> 22:59.658
- OK, OK.
- OK. OK.

23:00.409 --> 23:03.165
<i>Ojichan</i>, why are you haunting Maya?

23:08.760 --> 23:10.304
Oh, my God. M...

23:10.847 --> 23:12.350
- A...
- It's moving fast!

23:12.433 --> 23:14.855
- No. S-T...
- S-T...

23:15.314 --> 23:16.233
U...

23:17.360 --> 23:19.657
R-B...

23:20.867 --> 23:21.994
Whoa!

23:22.537 --> 23:25.292
That is crazy, <i>Ojichan</i>.

23:25.919 --> 23:27.631
Why did you just flick it?

23:27.965 --> 23:30.219
- I did not flick it.
- What the hell?

23:30.302 --> 23:32.724
That was not me. That was literally him.

23:32.808 --> 23:34.310
We're in the middle of contacting him.

23:34.394 --> 23:36.732
- I didn't flick it. I didn't.
- What the hell?

23:36.941 --> 23:38.318
You guys are playing Ouija?

23:39.446 --> 23:42.326
We're not playing, it's serious, so...

23:43.328 --> 23:44.707
That shit's so stupid.

23:44.915 --> 23:46.501
You realize

23:46.585 --> 23:49.549
one of you is just moving it
and it's just your subconscious, right?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.343
Are you OK?

24:13.013 --> 24:13.890
Yeah.

24:16.729 --> 24:18.900
I need to tell you my subconscious.

24:20.695 --> 24:21.781
OK.

24:29.379 --> 24:30.799
I'm like Sam...

24:31.968 --> 24:34.138
only I'm grosser, 'cause I'm a girl,

24:36.894 --> 24:38.230
and I'm a pervert.

24:39.357 --> 24:41.486
And I really shouldn't be doing
what I'm doing.

24:44.994 --> 24:48.918
I've been putting my hands
down my pants, um...

24:49.753 --> 24:51.214
my area...

24:52.466 --> 24:55.097
down there to feel good.

25:01.568 --> 25:04.449
Um, when I'm in bed...

25:05.619 --> 25:09.835
sometimes I put my hands
between my legs to feel good.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.256
Really?

25:14.135 --> 25:15.304
Yeah.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.602
Hey, you mean like this?

25:23.195 --> 25:25.950
Not exactly, um, sort of.

25:26.534 --> 25:27.954
You don't feel gross?

25:29.875 --> 25:31.879
How gross can I feel if you do it, too?

25:35.637 --> 25:36.931
Promise I'm not a pervert.

25:38.350 --> 25:39.227
I promise.

25:40.730 --> 25:42.191
And swear you won't tell anyone.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.697
- Oh, my God. I swear. You swear, too?
- I swear. Yeah.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.746
- Pinky swear.
- Pinky swear.

25:54.590 --> 25:57.388
Oh, is this about me drinking...

27:38.340 --> 27:41.262
Sweet! Sweet, I see.
