00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,219
<i>we need to hide in Windsor Caves
or Claw will kill us.</i>

00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,106
<i>No Puff Paws,
I can't leave without Dingle Pan.</i>

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,779
<i>Do you want me to stay with you?</i>

5
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:22,949
<i>You'll stay with me?</i>

6
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:24,701
<i>Yeah.</i>

7
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,083
<i>OK. Kiss me.</i>

8
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,851
Maya Chan,
did you brush your teeth?

9
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,855
Yeah, I'm in bed! I'm asleep now!

10
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:51,501
I love you.

11
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:54,436
- I love you.
- Let me turn the light off.

12
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:56,094
No, no, can you leave that on?

13
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:59,685
OK. All right.

14
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:48,866
Hurry up dummy!

15
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,247
- We're gonna be late for school!
- It's my bathroom, too! Shut up!

16
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,878
What are you doing in there?
Shaving your back?

17
00:02:55,838 --> 00:03:00,640
You can't just barge in!
I was brushing my teeth!

18
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:05,190
There is no privacy
in this house!

19
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:23,978
- Good morning.
- Morning.

20
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,482
Is it just me,
or it's super dry last night?

21
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,069
My nostrils are crusty.

22
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,956
This is too strong, again.

23
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,924
- It's a light roast.
- Light roasts are stronger, Curtis.

24
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:42,682
You know I don't like it strong
and yet you continue to make it strong.

25
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:45,772
- It's Peruvian.
- Yeah, well, it tastes like shit.

26
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:50,280
- OK, I'm gonna go. Love you. Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

27
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:54,790
Just use more cream, like...

28
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,171
- OK, thank you. I-I love you.
- OK, thanks. Love you.

29
00:03:58,254 --> 00:03:59,934
- I got to go.
- Have a good day at school.

30
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,810
Pay attention, people.

31
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,399
We're discussing The Hero's Journey.

32
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:09,820
- Maya.
- Ah.

33
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:12,241
Um, what are we gonna do this weekend?

34
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:14,704
Like I really want it to be fun.

35
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:18,211
- Yeah. Fun.
- <i>Do you wanna go see, like a movie,</i>

36
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,507
<i>or something. That would be fun.</i>

37
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:28,106
We could tell your mom
that we're gonna go see

38
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:30,820
<i>Chicken Run</i> and then see
<i>Coyote Ugly</i> instead.

39
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:36,036
What?

40
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,277
- Maya.
- Yeah. What?

41
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,076
- You're not listening, obviously.
- Yes, I am.

42
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,753
Um, I got to <i>poo.</i>

43
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:01,965
OK, let's go.

44
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:06,140
Or actually,
can... can I go in there alone this time

45
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,061
'cause I kinda want some privacy.

46
00:05:08,353 --> 00:05:10,148
Oh, yeah. You're your own person.

47
00:05:10,232 --> 00:05:11,652
- OK. Thanks.
- You just always

48
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:12,838
want me to go in there with you.

49
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,717
Yeah, I know,
it's just gonna be like, a nasty one.

50
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,178
So, I don't wanna put you
through that, you know.

51
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:17,922
It's OK.
I'll just breathe through my mouth.

52
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:21,797
OK, or can you just, like keep watch
outside, and that, so, no one can come in?

53
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:24,007
OK.

54
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:31,856
Hey.

55
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,391

56
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:52,942
Sexual.

57
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:55,740
Sex.

58
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:59,455

Like, we need to win
these backstage passes. We have to.

64
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:20,038
No one ever calls. It's gonna be so tight.

65
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,676

00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:45,923
Yeah. So, we need to call
the radio station tonight between 6 to 7

72
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,718
to try to get backstage passes.

73
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:52,227
And the good thing is that, like no one
ever calls, so, it's gonna be tight.

74
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:55,776
- Oh.
- Are you so going right now?

75
00:06:58,824 --> 00:07:00,243
That was a hard long one, huh?

76
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:04,334
So weird, it doesn't smell
like poop at all in here.

77
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:06,965
Your body must be changing or something.

78
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,303
Yeah.

79
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,269
All done.

80
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:19,573
So, we called 603, 606, we'll skip 605

81
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:22,663
- 'cause everyone's gonna call at 605.
- Yo, I found the Spice channel.

82
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:26,086
Yesterday, I mapped it out.
Every 48 seconds

83
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,549
it shows a titty
and it lasts for about a second.

84
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:31,472
- It's awesome.
- Wow, that's so, like... specific.

85
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,353
Hey, Sam, is it weird
to see your mom on screen?

86
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:38,027
- Do you stay hard?
- Fuck you. I stay hard 24/7.

87
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,327
Are you guys, like talking about,
like masturbating, or...

88
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,373
Yeah, Maya. Just ignore them.
Like, they're pervs.

89
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:46,001
It's just porn, dork.

90
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:48,422
OK, well, do you mind
keeping the sex talk down?

91
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:49,717
Can you just suck my balls?

92
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:52,974
- Oh, can I barf all over your fat face?
- Sam!

93
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,940
Hey, I heard Connie M. puts peanut butter
on her crotch and has a dog lick it.

94
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:58,902
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

95
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,365
- Eww.
- Eww.

96
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,827
What the fuck?

97
00:08:03,494 --> 00:08:06,166
That's nasty.
I could never do that.

98
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,300
So, I'm coming home with you, right?

99
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,847
- To make the calls?
- Yeah, yeah.

100
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,601
'Cause I just... I just don't want
to do it in my house, so...

101
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:16,686
Yeah.

102
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:18,942
Yeah. Oh...

103
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:21,906
- Dammit!
- What?

104
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,954
No, I forgot, I forgot. I have to, um...

105
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:28,419
go to Sam's house to do a math project.

106
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,175
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:35,809
- Do plans mean like zilch to you?
- No, I made a plan with Sam first,

108
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:39,191
so, obviously I'm keeping that.
Means a lot to me.

109
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:42,572
- Just remember to call Q102...
- Yeah.

- At 6:00 p.m.
- 6:00 p. m. I know.

111
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,752
- I'm not stupid. Don't worry, we'll win.

What's that smell?

165
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:18,165
- Let's go down. Let's eat.
- OK.

166
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:22,799
Why do you think she would lie?

167
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,431
I'm not sure.

168
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,694
She might be going through something
that has nothing to do with you.

169
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:31,692
It's all about boundaries.

170
00:13:32,151 --> 00:13:34,031
I pretty much know
everything about her, though.

171
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,159
I don't know what she could possibly
be going through that I wouldn't know.

172
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:57,911
- Mama.
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:05,248
Why are you talking like that?

174
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:07,596
I'm not talking like anything.

175
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:13,860
- Tonight we pay respect to <i>Ojichan</i>.
- Why?

176
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,826
It's his birthday, moron.
What, did you forget?

177
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
No.

178
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:21,792
OK, mama.

179
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:30,142
Can I help you clean up it all?

180
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,604
- Oh.
- Oh. You know what?

181
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,523
Why don't you go up
and say hi to the boys.

182
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:34,794
- Yeah.
- I think they're watching

183
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:36,488
- a movie or something.
- <i>Armageddon.</i>

184
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:41,039
Um, I just want you guys to know, like...

185
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:44,797
- I really love talking to you.
- Yeah, we don't wanna keep boring you.

186
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:46,926
No, no.
I could talk to you guys for hours.

187
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:50,099
I could even sleep here. Just kidding.
I'll go check on those rascals.

188
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:54,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

189
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,117
Happy birthday, <i>Ojichan.</i>

190
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:02,999
Thank you
for always watching over us.

191
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:07,843
Mama.

192
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:11,391
What do you mean,
"he's always watching over us"?

193
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:15,399
He protects us
and watches over us all the time.

194
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:19,616
Uh, when you're walking the street,
or when you're brushing your teeth.

195
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:22,037
All the time.

196
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:26,881
- Even when I'm in bed asleep?
- Yes.

197
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,304
Hmm.

198
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:36,650
Like, even when I'm...
I don't know, like napping?

199
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,318
Yes.

200
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:55,520
- Dude, was that boob?
- That was her foot, idiot.

201
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:57,316
- You promised her boob.
- It's coming.

202
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,445
I don't see anything.
I don't see...

203
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:02,869
- Oh, ho ho, yeah.
- There it is. Oh, my God!

204
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:05,082
- That is nice.
- Hey, guys...

205
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,461
- you mind if I join in on the movie?
- Anna, get out!

206
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:09,675
- What?
- Get out! Go!

207
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,137
- Is this...
- Get out, Anna!

208
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,267
- You're pervs.
- Hi, Anna.

209
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,320
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi, Yuki.

210
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:22,241
- <i>Oh, Anna, hi.</i>
- Um...

211
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,078
Sorry to call so late.

212
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,541
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- It's just kind of an emergency.

213
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,338
- Um, is Maya there, please.
- <i>What happened?</i>

214
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:30,883
<i>Is everything OK?</i>

215
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:32,677
Um...

216
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:35,475
It's not really an emergency.

217
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,981
- <i>Oh...</i>
- So, don't... don't worry about it.

218
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,444
- <i>OK.</i>
- I... I just really need to talk to Maya.

219
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:42,489
- Is she there?
- <i>Bed time.</i>

220
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:43,826
<i>Don't call so late.</i>

221
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:46,309
<i>- Talk tomorrow. Bye, Anna.</i>
- OK, but can you just tell me...

222
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,545
Hello?

223
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:04,993
Just hung up on... are you kidding...

224
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:09,961
And lied to, and...

225
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,844
stupid pervert boys.

226
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:21,192
- <i>Hello. What's your name?
- Diana.</i>

227
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,446
<i>Diana, you are caller 20.</i>

228
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,787
<i>- The winner...
- Oh, my God! Thank you so much!</i>

229
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,166
<i>You just won
two backstage passes</i>

230
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,089
<i>to see B♪Witched at
the Eastlake Amphitheater this Saturday.</i>

231
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:35,680
<i>Oh, my God! Yes! This
is the happiest day of my entire life!</i>

232
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,349
<i>What's your favorite radio station?</i>

233
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:40,313
<i>Overhead, Q102!</i>

234
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:51,879
Mommy!

235
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:56,722
- What's wrong?
- It's <i>Ojichan</i>! I see <i>Ojichan</i>!

236
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,602
That's nice. Say hello.

237
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:03,193
Sorry.

238
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:06,617
I didn't mean to do that. I wasn't doing
what you think I was doing.

239
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,328
I was just scratching.

240
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:14,298
Go away, please! Go away!

241
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:26,155
<i>The Gobi desert is amongst
the driest places in the world.</i>

242
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:37,885
Na?

243
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:41,893
Na?

244
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:47,699
Are you mad at me?

245
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:51,122
Why weren't you in carpool this morning?

246
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,796
'Cause I, like slept in.

247
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:57,301
- Oh, really? Oh.
- Yeah.

248
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:58,929
- Guess what?
- What?

249
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,810
I went to Sam's
and you weren't there. You liar.

250
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:07,780
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Busted buddy.

251
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:12,707
Na.

252
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:17,174
- Na, listen. OK.
- I'm trying to watch the video.

253
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:35,085
Go away. Go away.

254
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:45,896
Na.

255
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:50,281
- Na. Listen.
- I already told you, I'm trying to...

256
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:54,039
I'm sorry, I lied, OK?
That was really messed up.

257
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:57,212
But I'm doing it because I am hiding
something about me

258
00:19:57,295 --> 00:20:00,301
that has nothing to do with you.
I swear on my life.

259
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,972
Will you listen?

260
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:04,143
What?

261
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:09,153
I see dead people.

262
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:16,167
Oh. I, like, see ghosts all the time.

263
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,672
- For real?
- Yeah.

264
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:20,634
Who do you see?

265
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,018
I see my <i>Ojichan</i>.

266
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,690
What is an <i>Ojichan</i>?

267
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:30,821
- It's my grandpa. Yeah.
- Oh.

268
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:34,913
And it's like really freaky.
I'm not kidding.

269
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,590
I have an idea.

270
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,808
Spirit, show yourself.

271
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:47,605
Spirit, reveal.

272
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:52,824
Spirit, show yourself,
so, Maya knows you're real.

273
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:57,332
I think he's here.

274
00:20:57,499 --> 00:20:58,669
Oh, my God.

275
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:01,386
I don't know I could be wrong,
I just feel it.

276
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:03,929
- OK, so, put your hands on it.
- OK.

277
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:08,020
<i>Ojichan</i>...

278
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:10,901
are you here?

279
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,955
- Don't move it. OK, I'm not.
- I'm not.

280
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:18,541
<i>Ojichan</i>...

281
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:20,880
are you here?

282
00:21:23,802 --> 00:21:26,850
- Oh, my God. Are you moving it? God!
- I'm not moving it. Are you moving it?

283
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:30,481
OK, that's crazy!

284
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:32,420
- I don't want to do this.
- It's OK. Put your hands back.

285
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:33,444
I'm with you.

286
00:21:33,989 --> 00:21:35,158
Put your hands on it.

287
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:39,539
<i>Ojichan</i>...

288
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:41,212
why are you here?

289
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:44,636
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

290
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,932
C...

291
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:52,442
L...

292
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:55,824
I...

293
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:00,250
T...

294
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:09,059
T, C-L-I-T, clit.

295
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:14,988
Clit.

296
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:17,827
- Clit.
- Clit.

297
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:21,876
- I don't know what clit.
- I don't know clit.

298
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,676
- Eww.
- Eww.

299
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:27,680
- Clit!
- Clit!

300
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,726
- Maya!
- Anna!

301
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:31,145
- You're doing that.
- I'm not.

302
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:32,522
I was not touching.

303
00:22:32,606 --> 00:22:34,610
I swear on my life, I'm not moving it.

304
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:36,948
- You're moving it.
- My fingers are barely touching it.

305
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:38,034
OK, well, same.

306
00:22:40,163 --> 00:22:41,791
Why is your grandpa saying "clit"?

307
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:46,133
I don't know. Maybe it's not him.

308
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:47,928
- It's him for sure.
- It is.

309
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:52,688
- I can feel him.
- I don't know, now, I feel like...

310
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:56,070
- this is crazy...
- Maya, let's just try one more time.

311
00:22:56,153 --> 00:22:58,658
- OK, OK.
- OK. OK.

312
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:02,165
<i>Ojichan</i>, why are you haunting Maya?

313
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,304
Oh, my God. M...

314
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,350
- A...
- It's moving fast!

315
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,855
- No. S-T...
- S-T...

316
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:15,314
U...

317
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,657
R-B...

318
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:20,994
Whoa!

319
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:24,292
That is crazy, <i>Ojichan</i>.

320
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:26,631
Why did you just flick it?

321
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:29,219
- I did not flick it.
- What the hell?

322
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:31,724
That was not me. That was literally him.

323
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:33,328
We're in the middle of contacting him.

324
00:23:33,394 --> 00:23:35,732
- I didn't flick it. I didn't.
- What the hell?

325
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:37,318
You guys are playing Ouija?

326
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:41,326
We're not playing, it's serious, so...

327
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:43,707
That shit's so stupid.

328
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,501
You realize

329
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:48,549
one of you is just moving it
and it's just your subconscious, right?

330
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,343
Are you OK?

331
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:13,013
Yeah.

332
00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:17,900
I need to tell you my subconscious.

333
00:24:19,695 --> 00:24:20,781
OK.

334
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:29,799
I'm like Sam...

335
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,138
only I'm grosser, 'cause I'm a girl,

336
00:24:35,894 --> 00:24:37,230
and I'm a pervert.

337
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:40,486
And I really shouldn't be doing
what I'm doing.

338
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:47,918
I've been putting my hands
down my pants, um...

339
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,214
my area...

340
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:54,097
down there to feel good.

341
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:03,449
Um, when I'm in bed...

342
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,835
sometimes I put my hands
between my legs to feel good.

343
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:11,379
Really?

344
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:14,304
Yeah.

345
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,602
Hey, you mean like this?

346
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:24,950
Not exactly, um, sort of.

347
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:26,954
You don't feel gross?

348
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,879
How gross can I feel if you do it, too?

349
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:35,931
Promise I'm not a pervert.

350
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,350
I promise.

351
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,191
And swear you won't tell anyone.

352
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,697
- Oh, my God. I swear. You swear, too?
- I swear. Yeah.

353
00:25:46,284 --> 00:25:47,746
- Pinky swear.
- Pinky swear.

354
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,388
Oh, is this about me drinking...

355
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,262
Sweet! Sweet, I see.
