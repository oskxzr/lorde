I can't leave without Dingle Pan.</i>

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,779
<i>Do you want me to stay with you?</i>

5
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:22,949
<i>You'll stay with me?</i>

6
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:24,577
<i>Yeah.</i>

7
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,083
<i>OK. Kiss me.</i>

8
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,851
Maya Chan,
did you brush your teeth?

9
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,855
Yeah, I'm in bed! I'm asleep now!

10
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:51,501
I love you.

11
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:54,423
- I love you.
- Let me turn the light off.

12
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:56,094
No, no, can you leave that on?

13
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:59,685
OK. All right.

14
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,866
Hurry up dummy!

15
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,247
- We're gonna be late for school!
- It's my bathroom, too! Shut up!

16
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,878
What are you doing in there?
Shaving your back?

17
00:02:56,838 --> 00:03:01,640
You can't just barge in!
I was brushing my teeth!

18
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:06,190
There is no privacy
in this house!

19
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:24,978
- Good morning.
- Morning.

20
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,482
Is it just me,
or it's super dry last night?

21
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,069
My nostrils are crusty.

22
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:34,956
This is too strong, again.

23
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,924
- It's a light roast.
- Light roasts are stronger, Curtis.

24
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:43,682
You know I don't like it strong
and yet you continue to make it strong.

25
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,772
- It's Peruvian.
- Yeah, well, it tastes like shit.

26
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:51,280
- OK, I'm gonna go. Love you. Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

27
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:55,790
Just use more cream, like...

28
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,171
- OK, thank you. I-I love you.
- OK, thanks. Love you.

29
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:00,800
- I got to go.
- Have a good day at school.

30
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,810
Pay attention, people.

31
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,399
We're discussing The Hero's Journey.

32
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,820
- Maya.
- Ah.

33
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:13,241
Um, what are we gonna do this weekend?

34
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:15,704
Like I really want it to be fun.

35
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:19,211
- Yeah. Fun.
- <i>Do you wanna go see, like a movie,</i>

36
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:21,507
<i>or something. That would be fun.</i>

37
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:29,106
We could tell your mom
that we're gonna go see

38
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,820
<i>Chicken Run</i> and then see
<i>Coyote Ugly</i> instead.

39
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:36,997
What?

40
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,277
- Maya.
- Yeah. What?

41
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,076
- You're not listening, obviously.
- Yes, I am.

42
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:00,753
Um, I got to <i>poo.</i>

43
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:02,965
OK, let's go.

44
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:07,140
Or actually,
can... can I go in there alone this time

45
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,061
'cause I kinda want some privacy.

46
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,148
Oh, yeah. You're your own person.

47
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:12,652
- OK. Thanks.
- You just always

48
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:13,779
want me to go in there with you.

49
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:15,658
Yeah, I know,
it's just gonna be like, a nasty one.

50
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,118
So, I don't wanna put you
through that, you know.

51
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,872
It's OK.
I'll just breathe through my mouth.

52
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:22,797
OK, or can you just, like keep watch
outside, and that, so, no one can come in?

53
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:24,884
OK.

54
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:32,733
Hey.

55
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,391

58
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:00,455

these backstage passes. We have to.

64
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:21,038

Oh, my God.

this weekend. B freaking Witched.

Hey, hey, hey...

71
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:46,923
Yeah. So, we need to call
the radio station tonight between 6 to 7

72
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,718
to try to get backstage passes.

73
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:53,227
And the good thing is that, like no one
ever calls, so, it's gonna be tight.

74
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:56,776
- Oh.
- Are you so going right now?

75
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:01,243
That was a hard long one, huh?

76
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:05,334
So weird, it doesn't smell
like poop at all in here.

77
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:07,965
Your body must be changing or something.

78
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:11,180
Yeah.

79
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,269
All done.

80
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:20,573
So, we called 603, 606, we'll skip 605

81
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:23,663
- 'cause everyone's gonna call at 605.
- Yo, I found the Spice channel.

82
00:07:23,997 --> 00:07:27,086
Yesterday, I mapped it out.
Every 48 seconds

83
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,549
it shows a titty
and it lasts for about a second.

84
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:32,472
- It's awesome.
- Wow, that's so, like... specific.

85
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,353
Hey, Sam, is it weird
to see your mom on screen?

86
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:39,027
- Do you stay hard?
- Fuck you. I stay hard 24/7.

87
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,327
Are you guys, like talking about,
like masturbating, or...

88
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,373
Yeah, Maya. Just ignore them.
Like, they're pervs.

89
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:47,001
It's just porn, dork.

90
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:49,422
OK, well, do you mind
keeping the sex talk down?

91
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:50,717
Can you just suck my balls?

92
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:53,974
- Oh, can I barf all over your fat face?
- Sam!

93
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,940
Hey, I heard Connie M. puts peanut butter
on her crotch and has a dog lick it.

94
00:07:58,315 --> 00:07:59,902
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

95
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:02,365
- Eww.
- Eww.

96
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,827
What the fuck?

97
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:07,166
That's nasty.
I could never do that.

98
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,300
So, I'm coming home with you, right?

99
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,847
- To make the calls?
- Yeah, yeah.

100
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,601
'Cause I just... I just don't want
to do it in my house, so...

101
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:17,562
Yeah.

102
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,942
Yeah. Oh...

103
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:22,906
- Dammit!
- What?

104
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:25,954
No, I forgot, I forgot. I have to, um...

105
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:29,419
go to Sam's house to do a math project.

106
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:32,175
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:36,809
- Do plans mean like zilch to you?
- No, I made a plan with Sam first,

108
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:40,191
so, obviously I'm keeping that.
Means a lot to me.

109
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,572
- Just remember to call Q102...
- Yeah.

110
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,286
- ...at 6:00 p.m.
- 6:00 p. m. I know.

111
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,752
- I'm not stupid. Don't worry, we'll win.
- I refuse to be home this weekend.

112
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,463

to come unannounced.

Hope I'm not interrupting.

136
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:03,055
Um, I just wanted to stop by while May
and Sam did their project,

I'm not sure.

155
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,520
She might be going through something

161
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,596
I'm not talking like anything.

162
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:14,860
- Tonight we pay respect to <i>Ojichan</i>.
- Why?

163
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,826
It's his birthday, moron.
What, did you forget?

No.

- Oh.
- Oh. You know what?

168
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:34,523
Why don't you go up
and say hi to the boys.

169
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:35,735
- Yeah.
- I think they're watching

170
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:37,488
- a movie or something.
- <i>Armageddon.</i>

171
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:42,039
Um, I just want you guys to know, like...

172
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,797
- I really love talking to you.
- Yeah, we don't wanna keep boring you.

173
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:47,926
No, no.
I could talk to you guys for hours.

174
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:51,099
I could even sleep here. Just kidding.
I'll go check on those rascals.

175
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:55,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

176
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,117
Happy birthday, <i>Ojichan.</i>

177
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:03,999
Thank you
for always watching over us.

178
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:08,843
Mama.

179
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:12,391
What do you mean,
"he's always watching over us"?

180
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:16,399
He protects us
and watches over us all the time.

181
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:20,616
Uh, when you're walking the street,
or when you're brushing your teeth.

182
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:23,037
All the time.

183
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:27,881
- Even when I'm in bed asleep?
- Yes.

184
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,264
Hmm.

185
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:37,650
Like, even when I'm...
I don't know, like napping?

186
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:39,236
Yes.

187
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:56,520
- Dude, was that boob?
- That was her foot, idiot.

188
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:58,316
- You promised her boob.
- It's coming.

189
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,445
I don't see anything.
I don't see...

190
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:03,869
- Oh, ho ho, yeah.
- There it is. Oh, my God!

191
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:06,082
- That is nice.
- Hey, guys...

192
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,461
- you mind if I join in on the movie?
- Anna, get out!

193
00:16:08,544 --> 00:16:10,675
- What?
- Get out! Go!

194
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:13,137
- Is this...
- Get out, Anna!

195
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:15,267
- You're pervs.
- Hi, Anna.

196
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:21,320
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi, Yuki.

197
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:23,241
- <i>Oh, Anna, hi.</i>
- Um...

198
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:25,078
Sorry to call so late.

199
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,541
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- It's just kind of an emergency.

200
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,338
- Um, is Maya there, please.
- <i>What happened?</i>

201
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:31,883
<i>Is everything OK?</i>

202
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:33,637
Um...

203
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:36,475
It's not really an emergency.

204
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,981
- <i>Oh...</i>
- So, don't... don't worry about it.

205
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,444
- <i>OK.</i>
- I... I just really need to talk to Maya.

206
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:43,489
- Is she there?
- <i>Bed time.</i>

207
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:44,826
<i>Don't call so late.</i>

208
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:47,205
<i>- Talk tomorrow. Bye, Anna.</i>
- OK, but can you just tell me...

209
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,545
Hello?

210
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:05,993
Just hung up on... are you kidding...

211
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:10,961
And lied to, and...

212
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,844
stupid pervert boys.

213
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,192
- <i>Hello. What's your name?
- Diana.</i>

214
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,446
<i>Diana, you are caller 20.</i>

215
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,787
<i>- The winner...
- Oh, my God! Thank you so much!</i>

216
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,166
<i>You just won
two backstage passes</i>

217
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,089
<i>to see B♪Witched at
the Eastlake Amphitheater this Saturday.</i>

218
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:36,680
<i>Oh, my God! Yes! This
is the happiest day of my entire life!</i>

219
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,349
<i>What's your favorite radio station?</i>

220
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,313
<i>Overhead, Q102!</i>

221
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:52,879
Mommy!

222
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:57,722
- What's wrong?
- It's <i>Ojichan</i>! I see <i>Ojichan</i>!

223
00:17:58,222 --> 00:18:00,602
That's nice. Say hello.

224
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,193
Sorry.

225
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:07,617
I didn't mean to do that. I wasn't doing
what you think I was doing.

226
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,328
I was just scratching.

227
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,298
Go away, please! Go away!

228
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:27,155
<i>The Gobi desert is amongst
the driest places in the world.</i>

229
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:38,762
Na?

230
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:42,770
Na?

231
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:48,699
Are you mad at me?

232
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,122
Why weren't you in carpool this morning?

233
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,796
'Cause I, like slept in.

234
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:58,301
- Oh, really? Oh.
- Yeah.

235
00:18:58,551 --> 00:18:59,929
- Guess what?
- What?

236
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,810
I went to Sam's
and you weren't there. You liar.

237
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:08,780
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Busted buddy.

238
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:13,707
Na.

239
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,174
- Na, listen. OK.
- I'm trying to watch the video.

240
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:36,085
Go away. Go away.

241
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:46,815
Na.

242
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:51,281
- Na. Listen.
- I already told you, I'm trying to...

243
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:55,039
I'm sorry, I lied, OK?
That was really messed up.

244
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:58,212
But I'm doing it because I am hiding
something about me

245
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:01,301
that has nothing to do with you.
I swear on my life.

246
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,972
Will you listen?

247
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:05,143
What?

248
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:10,153
I see dead people.

249
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:17,167
Oh. I, like, see ghosts all the time.

250
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:19,672
- For real?
- Yeah.

251
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:21,634
Who do you see?

252
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:26,018
I see my <i>Ojichan</i>.

253
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:28,690
What is an <i>Ojichan</i>?

254
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:31,821
- It's my grandpa. Yeah.
- Oh.

255
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:35,913
And it's like really freaky.
I'm not kidding.

256
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:41,590
I have an idea.

257
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,808
Spirit, show yourself.

258
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:48,605
Spirit, reveal.

259
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:53,824
Spirit, show yourself,
so, Maya knows you're real.

260
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:58,332
I think he's here.

261
00:20:58,499 --> 00:20:59,669
Oh, my God.

262
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:02,298
I don't know I could be wrong,
I just feel it.

263
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:04,929
- OK, so, put your hands on it.
- OK.

264
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:09,020
<i>Ojichan</i>...

265
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:11,901
are you here?

266
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,955
- Don't move it. OK, I'm not.
- I'm not.

267
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:19,541
<i>Ojichan</i>...

268
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:21,880
are you here?

269
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:27,850
- Oh, my God. Are you moving it? God!
- I'm not moving it. Are you moving it?

270
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:31,481
OK, that's crazy!

271
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,360
- I don't want to do this.
- It's OK. Put your hands back.

272
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:34,321
I'm with you.

273
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,158
Put your hands on it.

274
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,416
<i>Ojichan</i>...

275
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:42,212
why are you here?

276
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,636
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

277
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,932
C...

278
00:21:51,814 --> 00:21:53,442
L...

279
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:56,824
I...

280
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:01,250
T...

281
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:10,059
T, C-L-I-T, clit.

282
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:15,988
Clit.

283
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:18,827
- Clit.
- Clit.

284
00:22:20,246 --> 00:22:22,876
- I don't know what clit.
- I don't know clit.

285
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,676
- Eww.
- Eww.

286
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:28,680
- Clit!
- Clit!

287
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,726
- Maya!
- Anna!

288
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,145
- You're doing that.
- I'm not.

289
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:33,522
I was not touching.

290
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:35,610
I swear on my life, I'm not moving it.

291
00:22:35,694 --> 00:22:37,948
- You're moving it.
- My fingers are barely touching it.

292
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:39,034
OK, well, same.

293
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:42,791
Why is your grandpa saying "clit"?

294
00:22:44,336 --> 00:22:47,133
I don't know. Maybe it's not him.

295
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,928
- It's him for sure.
- It is.

296
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,688
- I can feel him.
- I don't know, now, I feel like...

297
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:57,070
- this is crazy...
- Maya, let's just try one more time.

298
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:59,658
- OK, OK.
- OK. OK.

299
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:03,165
<i>Ojichan</i>, why are you haunting Maya?

300
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,304
Oh, my God. M...

301
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,350
- A...
- It's moving fast!

302
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,855
- No. S-T...
- S-T...

303
00:23:15,314 --> 00:23:16,233
U...

304
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,657
R-B...

305
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:21,994
Whoa!

306
00:23:22,537 --> 00:23:25,292
That is crazy, <i>Ojichan</i>.

307
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,631
Why did you just flick it?

308
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:30,219
- I did not flick it.
- What the hell?

309
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:32,724
That was not me. That was literally him.

310
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:34,310
We're in the middle of contacting him.

311
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:36,732
- I didn't flick it. I didn't.
- What the hell?

312
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:38,318
You guys are playing Ouija?

313
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:42,326
We're not playing, it's serious, so...

314
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:44,707
That shit's so stupid.

315
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:46,501
You realize

316
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:49,549
one of you is just moving it
and it's just your subconscious, right?

317
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,343
Are you OK?

318
00:24:13,013 --> 00:24:13,890
Yeah.

319
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:18,900
I need to tell you my subconscious.

320
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:21,781
OK.

321
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:30,799
I'm like Sam...

322
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:34,138
only I'm grosser, 'cause I'm a girl,

323
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,230
and I'm a pervert.

324
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:41,486
And I really shouldn't be doing
what I'm doing.

325
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:48,918
I've been putting my hands
down my pants, um...

326
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:51,214
my area...

327
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:55,097
down there to feel good.

328
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:04,449
Um, when I'm in bed...

329
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:09,835
sometimes I put my hands
between my legs to feel good.

330
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:12,256
Really?

331
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:15,304
Yeah.

332
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,602
Hey, you mean like this?

333
00:25:23,195 --> 00:25:25,950
Not exactly, um, sort of.

334
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:27,954
You don't feel gross?

335
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,879
How gross can I feel if you do it, too?

336
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:36,931
Promise I'm not a pervert.

337
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,227
I promise.

338
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,191
And swear you won't tell anyone.

339
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,697
- Oh, my God. I swear. You swear, too?
