1
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:53,501
<i>Welcome!</i>

2
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,246
- OK, so screen names...
- OK.

3
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,610
So I have three options here for me...

4
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:19,841
Stardust4eva, Sclub7...

5
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:22,262
- which might be taken already...
- Mm-hmm.

6
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:24,099
...and Babyspice666.

7
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:26,145
Isn't 666 like the Devil's number?

8
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,899
No.

9
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,199
Six is my favorite number
and my lucky number, so...

10
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,373
Oh, my God!

11
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:40,048
- Good job.
- I got mine.

12
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:44,682
OK, cool, my turn.

13
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,647
What do you mean?
I just signed on to mine.

14
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,943
You got a screen name. Now it's my turn.

15
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,445
But I haven't added any "Buddies".

16
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:52,949
You, like, don't need to.

17
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:55,955
You just have one buddy.
Your boyfriend buddy.

18
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,292
Maya, that's not even funny.

19
00:01:58,376 --> 00:01:59,629
Like, we're barely boyfriend-girlfriend.

20
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:00,631
Yeah, right.

21
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:03,637
"Hi, Brendan. It's Anna.
I'm hogging the computer.

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,681
I love you."

23
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:09,774
Who's "hockey00?"

24
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:11,485
It's Alex.

25
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,383
Stop.

26
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,241
So funny.

27
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,582
My God!

28
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,222
It's messed up.

29
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:08,516
He probably got knocked off.

30
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,269
- That's shady.
- That happens.

31
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:11,856
That's not cool.

32
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,027
- OK, let's talk to Sam.
- OK, fine.

33
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,405
What's his screen name?

34
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:16,407
OK.

35
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,833
It is "LittlemanbigD1814"

36
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,004
"Little man big D?"

37
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,591
Ew!

38
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,978
He's so nasty.

39
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,857
It's funny, though.

40
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,359
Type it in.

41
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:36,740
Hey, hun. It's Anna.

42
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:39,119
No, and me. Say, "Me, too."

43
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:42,250
- Maya.
- Say, "Me" ah... "and Maya."

44
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,335
OK.

45
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:52,897
OK, he wants to know my screen name.

46
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,274
I want to type.

47
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:57,363
Don't have one yet. Dash from Maya.

48
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:05,254
<i>Tell me when you do.
Dash from Sam. TTYL.</i>

49
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,724
Oh, my God. Who's "Dogwigs2332?"

50
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,187
Oh, my God, Brendan's online.

51
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:15,525
Oh, my God!

52
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:22,247
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. Should I respond?

53
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,752
Like, what if Alex comes back on,
and I'm distracted.

54
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:27,758
Yeah, but he's like your boyfriend,
so you have to respond.

55
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:34,104
<i>Yeah, I know. WUWU?</i>

56
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,989
"WUWU"?

57
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:41,535
What the fuck is WUWU?

58
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,921
Oh, my God.
He doesn't even know what WUWU means?

59
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:49,050
I don't know what it means.
What does it mean?

60
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:51,346
What's up with you.

61
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,100
WUWU.

62
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,981
<i>I can't believe
you don't know what that means.</i>

63
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:57,233
<i>Smiley face.</i>

64
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,446
OK, it's my turn.

65
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:01,743
Maya, Brendan just IM'd me.

66
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:03,037
No, let me set up my screen name.

67
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,790
- Maya, we're talking.
- Give it.

68
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:08,255
Stop! It's my turn!

69
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,426
Please, don't break my keyboard.
Don't break my keyboard.

70
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:15,061
Give it to me! Thank you. Finally, like...

71
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:16,689
I just... OK, let me say good-bye.

72
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:19,569
OK, say good-bye and then bye-bye forever.

73
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:28,462
OK, screen name. So I'm gonna be...

74
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,719
Viper911.

75
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:36,103
- My God! What the eff! It's taken.
- I'm sorry, hun.

76
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,858
- But look, AIM gives other options.
- Oh, yeah.

77
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:41,196
Let me see.

78
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:43,117
I'm just gonna do this one.

79
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,787
- The "D" one?
- Yeah.

80
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,041
It's Viper with a "D" 911.

81
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,964
Diaper emergency!

82
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:53,345
Think about it.

83
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,101
I think it's, like, cool.

84
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:09,628
<i>Waz up dingleberry?</i>

85
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,018
<i>Oh, my God!
Your screen name what the eff!</i>

86
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,650
Can I just check to see
if Brendan's still online?

87
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:24,366
Anna, like, you were just talking to him.
You don't even like him that much.

88
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:27,998
There he is.

89
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:30,127
What's that thing next to his name?

90
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:33,927
- It's weird.
- Oh, wait.

91
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,806
He has a quote. It's like...

92
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,988
Wait. That's about you.

93
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,617
What do you mean?

94
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:48,080
He's, like, obsessed with you.

95
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:49,582
He wants to hug you.

96
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,586
It's just an away message, Maya.

97
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,549
OK, I wanna see who else is on.

98
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,390
What the eff? Everyone's signing off.

99
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:00,312
Have you ever been in a chatroom?

100
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:06,449
OK, what's that one? M4m.

101
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:08,036
Holy eff. No way, Maya!

102
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,330
- What?
- Local one.

103
00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:11,084
"Hot people of Franklin County."

104
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:13,255
Wait. Should we go in there?

105
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:16,637
- Are we allowed?
- We're hot. We're in Franklin.

106
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,398
OK, yeah, I guess they can't see
if we're hot or not, so just... do it.

107
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:23,400
Do it.

108
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:25,279
- Oh, my God.
- Uh, like, 16 people.

109
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,408
Oh, my God.
This is so crazy.

110
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:28,828
Say something.

111
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:29,872
What do I say?

112
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,460
- You do it.
- No, you do it.

113
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:33,922
You do it.

114
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:36,092
OK, fine.

115
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:37,930
What do I say?

116
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:42,063
OK. 'Sup hotties?

117
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:45,987
I'm hot girl.

118
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,323
Maya!

119
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,535
Oh, my God.

120
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:52,375
Wait. It's, like, going so fast,

121
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,212
you know, it, like, gets lost.

122
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:55,966
OK, Maya, "PhuckMaStick" just said "asl".

123
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:57,970
What does "asl" stand for?

124
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,650
Oh, my God. Can he see?

125
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:07,906
Of course not.
My dad doesn't have a webcam.

126
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:11,246
- Accept or decline?
- You do it. You do it.

127
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:13,125
- Cool.
- Accept.

128
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,127
OK.

129
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,302
'Sup, baby.
How hot are you? Show me!

130
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:22,560
- My God!
- Oh, my God!

131
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:24,439
- Oh, my God, Maya.
- Oh, my God, 'Na, stop!

132
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:25,859
- You're freaking me out.
- You're freaking me out.

133
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:26,861
Stop!

134
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:29,532
Hey, I need to use the phone right now...

135
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:31,119
...so IM time is over.

136
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:32,956
Got it.

137
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,502
Like, now.

138
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,131
- OK.
- OK.

139
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:38,508
Look out.

140
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:40,638
<i>Good-bye.</i>

141
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,479
Listen, Sam,
it was, like, so messed up.

142
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:46,316
It was crazy, crazy-crazy.

143
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,111
Wait. You talked to some guy in town?

144
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,992
Well, he can't find you
unless you've told him where you live.

145
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:54,499
Are you say... We were in a room
for Franklin County for hot people,

146
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:56,336
like, that's what we were in.

147
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,048
<i>He doesn't know your name.
Does he?</i>

148
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:01,304
Sam, you're scaring us. Why?

149
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:04,185
Sam, stop. No.
He just knows our screen names, like...

150
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:06,147
You're fine, Diper911.

151
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:07,943
It's just for guys who wanna hook up.

152
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,992
All right. I'm gonna hang up now.
Later, losers.

153
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:13,537
Bye.

154
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:17,128
Oh, my God.

155
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:19,382
Stop. It's my mom. It's my mom.

156
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:21,469
Jesus!

157
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,432
- Love you.
- Love you, Anna.

158
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:25,603
Maya.

159
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:45,434
No. Frickin' like, "Do your homework."

160
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:50,277
Sponges and sea stars,
like, it's not that hard.

161
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,343
- Maya?
- <i>Welcome!</i>

162
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,180
Are you done with your homework?

163
00:10:25,264 --> 00:10:27,602
<i>- You've got mail.</i>
- Yeah. I'm doing it.

164
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:29,564
Like, I need the computer

165
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:31,484
for a research project, so...

166
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:33,154
Research project?

167
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:35,284
Yeah. It's due tomorrow.

168
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,956
Tomorrow? Well, then hurry up
and finish it.

169
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,256
Duh! It's literally what I'm doing,
so can you leave me alone, please?

170
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,176
OK.

171
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,596
So... I heard something today

172
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,897
while I was, um,
driving Anna and Maya home.

173
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,651
They were whispering, but...

174
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:15,113
What?

175
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:17,242
You have a boyfriend.

176
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:21,125
- What?
- Mom, what, you spying on us?

177
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,756
Who? Someone we know?

178
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,092
Brandon.

179
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:27,847
Mom, it's Brendan. It's not Brandon.

180
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:29,685
You're not even a good spy,

181
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,939
and we're just taking it
really, really slow.

182
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:33,776
We just barely started going out.

183
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,945
Is he a catch?

184
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:38,326
Because you are catch. Kinda major catch.

185
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:44,296
Curtis, is this from Wok N' Roll
or Shanghai?

186
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,971
Because Wok N' Roll is the one
that made me sick

187
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:49,473
after your mole removal.

188
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,770
I thought that was Shanghai, so...

189
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,816
OK, so this is Wok N' Roll.

190
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,072
Seriously I reminded you this morning
before you left.

191
00:11:57,156 --> 00:11:58,743
<i>Now again you made me...</i>

192
00:11:58,826 --> 00:11:59,953
<i>It's Chinese food.</i>

193
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:01,289
<i>No, it's not Chinese food.</i>

194
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:02,751
<i>That one place makes me sick,</i>

195
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,253
<i>and the other place doesn't.</i>

196
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:23,333
I'm calling Anna for homework help.

197
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:28,855
OK.

198
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:39,448
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Oh, my God, 'Na!

199
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:41,620
I'm back
in "Hot people of Franklin County."

200
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:43,916
Oh, my God, you're back in?

201
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:45,670
<i>There's like 19 people in here.</i>

202
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:46,797
What are they saying?

203
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,137
They're saying so many things,
like, "discrete?"

204
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:52,851
"Purple pussy cat."

205
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,564
- "Looking to play."
- <i>You love playing.</i>

206
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,944
Oh, my God, some random guy
just IM'd me again.

207
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,865
- 'Na...
- <i>Oh, my God, Maya, be careful.</i>

208
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:01,367
<i>Remember last time.</i>

209
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,496
Flymiamibro22.

210
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,043
- <i>That's a hot screen name.</i>
- Yeah.

211
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,716
OK, I'm clicking on it.

212
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:12,055
He says, "Hey, hottie. Zup.
What you look like?"

213
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,312
Oh, my God, 'Na, he thinks I'm hot,
and he's saying hi. Help me.

214
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,399
- What do I say back?
- <i>Well, he can't find our age.</i>

215
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:18,611
Yeah, obviously.

216
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:20,488
OK, let's just say we're like...

217
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,578
Well, um...

218
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:27,211
We are both 13, so, like, 13 plus 13,
that's like 26.

219
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:29,256
I'm just gonna say we're 26.

220
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,927
<i>Say we have blonde hair
and brown eyes,</i>

221
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,264
<i>- like, if we were one person.</i>
- OK. I love that.

222
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:36,939
Blonde hair. Brown eyes.

223
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,742
Oh, my God, he thinks we're hot.

224
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:45,121
OK, wait.

225
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:49,171
He's 30. He's a computer programmer
and a total gym rat.

226
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:52,929
Oh, my God, he's a freaking gym rat.
That's like...

227
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,100
what is that?

228
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:58,314
OK. Are you hot?

229
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,318
<i>Um, it's a chatroom
for hot people.</i>

230
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:01,613
<i>- Remember?</i>
- Shh!

231
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:04,326
Oh, my God, he says,

232
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,247
"People tell me I'm hot but I am humble.

233
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,792
It's not for me to say."

234
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,003
That means he's hot.

235
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:10,715
Wait, that's what people say that are hot.

236
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:11,675
<i>I know.</i>

237
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:14,681
I'm, like, into this guy.

238
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:17,144
Oh, Maya, can you hold on?
I just have call waiting.

239
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:18,438
OK.

240
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:21,527
Hello?

241
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,573
<i>Hi. Can I please
speak to Anna please?</i>

242
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:25,452
<i>This is Brendan Tooler speaking.</i>

243
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:27,497
Hi. It's Anna.

244
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:28,917
<i>Uh, hi.</i>

245
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:31,965
What's up? You called...

246
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,301
<i>Yeah, is that cool?</i>

247
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:36,892
Yeah, I just... I'm talking to
Maya on the other line

248
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,854
so I'm just gonna have to...

249
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:41,735
um, tell her that I'll call her back,
I guess.

250
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:43,071
<i>Oh. OK, sure.</i>

251
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:44,573
OK, hold on.

252
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,454
- Maya?
- <i>What?</i>

253
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:49,041
Oh, my God, Brendan just called me.

254
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:50,878
- <i>Wait. Really?</i>
- Like...

255
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,130
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- ...are you kidding?

256
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:53,842
<i>Anna, this is like real...</i>

257
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,263
Um, can I call you back
and just talk to him for a minute, like...

258
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:57,809
No. Go, go, go.

259
00:14:57,892 --> 00:14:59,938
I'm talking to Flymiami.

260
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:01,858
<i>Well, you're still
chatting with him?</i>

261
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,902
I know it's crazy.

262
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,406
- <i>Progress check in the morning.</i>
- OK.

263
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,035
- <i>OK. Be good over there, bye!</i>
- Bye.

264
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:18,099
I like nature too.

265
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:21,021
Sand dunes.

266
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:23,652
Ha. JK.

267
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:26,157
Mm.

268
00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:29,037
I shouldn't have said that.

269
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,183
That's like...

270
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,153
Flymiamibro?

271
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:28,907
'Sup?

272
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:34,543
<i>Yo, girl,
you got an email address?</i>

273
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,171
<i>Yeah, I'll give it to you, hottie.</i>

274
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:37,758
- That's hot.
- You're hot.

275
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:40,054
- You're so fricking hot.
- I've never felt this way before.

276
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:41,850
- Me neither. My heart's gonna burst.
- Bang!

277
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,854
- Am I dead?
- You could take it, bitch.

278
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,023
Because I'm in heaven with you right now.

279
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:46,651
- Bury me.
- When I think of other girls,

280
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:47,737
I wanna barf my guts out.

281
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,535
I wanna eat that barf and guts up
like a big, old bowl of lentil soup.

282
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:52,913
Yum, yum, yum, yum...

283
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:54,499
Sometimes there's so much beauty
in the world

284
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,501
I feel like I can't take it.

285
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:57,840
I love you more than I love my own dad.

286
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:58,967
- Maya-chan!
- Aah!

287
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,470
Why are you still up?

288
00:17:04,645 --> 00:17:06,733
I just finished the research project.

289
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,906
- Go to bed.
- OK.

290
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,422
I think I'm in love.

291
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:22,222
- Wow.
- Yeah.

292
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,307
- Mai?
- Yeah.

293
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,103
- That's a really big word.
- No, I know.

294
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:27,482
And you just like, barely know him
is the only thing.

295
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:29,737
No, I know, but, like,
sometimes you can just tell.

296
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:32,117
- You haven't met him yet?
- It's from the way we're talking.

297
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,119
Wassup, Maya?

298
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:35,081
Hey.

299
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:38,964
See. Even Evan's way less hot to me
since I met Flymiamibro.

300
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:41,720
- That's how you know.
- Oh, my God. Don't look.

301
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:43,389
Hey, Anna. Hey, Maya.

302
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:44,642
- Hey, Brendan.
- Hey.

303
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:47,188
I burned this for you.

304
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:52,992
'Cause you said you love music.

305
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:56,958
You don't have to listen to it.

306
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:00,047
No, I do love music. Thank you.

307
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,343
- Bye.
- Bye.

308
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:08,522
Oh, my God,
he's, like, in love with you.

309
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:10,234
- We talked for hours last night.
- Wait. Really?

310
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:11,654
It's all moving too fast.

311
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:13,950
No, I think it's moving exactly
the right speed.

312
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:15,077
I do.

313
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:16,998
Seventh grade rules.

314
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:25,682
I can't believe he made me a mix CD.

315
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:27,018
The song sucks.

316
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:29,564
Play the next one.

317
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,453
Oh, my God, he wants to slow-dance
with you...

318
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:38,708
Maya, shut up!

319
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,671
Anna, does your dad have a digital camera?

320
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:25,761
Mm-hmm.

321
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:29,309
You think we can take a picture of me
and send it to Flymiamibro.

322
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:32,273
- No.
- Why?

323
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:34,527
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No. Yes, it is.

324
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:36,073
It's just not something
we should be doing.

325
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:39,412
It's just like a picture of me
so he can know what I look like.

326
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:42,043
- No. We are not doing it.
- No... Anna, yes.

327
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:43,755
Maya, I'm putting my foot down.

328
00:19:43,838 --> 00:19:45,216
Absolutely not.

329
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:51,311
That's hot.

330
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:53,190
And make sure you're getting the boob too.

331
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:54,777
Sure, do.

332
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,908
OK, let me see it.

333
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,108
Let me see.

334
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,874
Oh, My God.

335
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,047
That looks bad. That's blurry.

336
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:07,678
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, wait, I like that one.

337
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:09,514
That's good.

338
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:11,560
Showing a lot. Um...

339
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:14,149
How about just this one?

340
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:17,530
That's literally just my hand.

341
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:19,117
I know but it's beautiful.

342
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,000
OK.

343
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,379
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. I'm gonna send it.

344
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:28,594
Oh, my God.

345
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:30,932
Stop it! stop it!
Anna, Anna, stop.

346
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:32,728
- What if he doesn't think it's pretty?
- I can't believe you just did that.

347
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:34,607
What if he doesn't think it's pretty?

348
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,611
Oh my God, he already responded.

349
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,698
"So hot."

350
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,421
OK, I'm sorry, we have to meet.

351
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:49,135
- What?
- Ssh!

352
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:51,766
I have to meet you...

353
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,185
- Maya, don't send that.
- Stop.

354
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:55,147
- ...in person.
- Maya, don't send that.

355
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:00,032
- No. Don't send that.
- I sent it.

356
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:01,493
I sent it.

357
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,706
- Maya!
- Stop.

358
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:12,933
Oh, my God!

359
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,529
Are you like so nervous?

360
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,285
- I mean... a little.
- Yeah?

361
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:23,579
Yeah.

362
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:25,792
It's like I know he's the one, you know.

363
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:27,420
Who are you guys talking about?

364
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:28,798
None of your freaking business, Jafeer.

365
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:31,428
Yeah, it's none of your freaking business.

366
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:33,599
If you really want to know...

367
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:35,394
I've met someone.

368
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:38,442
Or I'm about to meet him after school.

369
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,947
Wait, you haven't met him in person yet?

370
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:44,162
- That's shady.
- Oh, no, we've talked on AIM like a lot.

371
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:47,836
He's probably some wart-y old dude,
who has a beer belly

372
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,882
or suit socks and lives with his mother.

373
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:53,723
Or he's a computer genius
with a tight bod, Jafeer.

374
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:56,353
- Like you wouldn't even...
- Can we just change the conversation?

375
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,523
- What?
- Start a new one.

376
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,361
We weren't even talking to you.

377
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,281
It's just kinda lame.

378
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:05,079
- OK, well...
- OK, well, stop... like, don't listen.

379
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:07,626
- Anyway, Mai?
- What?

380
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:10,381
I'm like, so excited for you, honestly.

381
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:12,134
- I really, really am.
- Yeah, yeah.

382
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:14,389
- I just wanna ask one quick question.
- OK, what?

383
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:15,850
Are you sure that you want to meet him,

384
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,813
because what if he's pissed
that you're a kid.

385
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,282
I don't think that's a possibility,
like, I don't.

386
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:25,244
- OK.
- I'm not gonna stand him up.

387
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,579
I couldn't do that to him...

388
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:29,168
- Right. OK.
- You know. Yeah.

389
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,258
- I just feel like we need back up.
- Yeah.

390
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:35,055
- Yeah.
- Like someone that can protect us.

391
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:36,851
We should ask Brendan.

392
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:47,998
'Sup, B?

393
00:22:48,582 --> 00:22:49,500
Spencer.

394
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,187
You're OK, Maya? Can I get you some water?

395
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,314
I'm good.

396
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:02,568
I'm good. Don't leave.

397
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:08,246
What if he gets mad when he sees me
that I don't look like what I said I look?

398
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,125
Maya, you're fine.

399
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:12,588
You're fine as hell. You're finer
than you even described.

400
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:13,674
Yeah.

401
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,346
And maybe he doesn't look like
how he described himself.

402
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,225
I mean, he could really be
anybody in here.

403
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:20,605
Yeah.

404
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,577
Do you know what's crazy?

405
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:13,502
I was just thinking that, like,
in three years, we'll be driving...

406
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:44,105
Maybe his Ferrari broke down.

407
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:48,154
- Hmm-mm, maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

408
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:51,954
I think it's getting dark.

409
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:54,960
We should just get home soon
before it gets too late.

410
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:56,337
Do you think he...

411
00:24:56,588 --> 00:25:00,137
Do you think that he came and saw me
and thought I was ugly and left?

412
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:03,603
Well, if he did that, then he's an idiot.

413
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:09,238
Yeah, or I'm like an idiot
for thinking he would like me.

414
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,328
- Mai.
- No, no, I'm fine.

415
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:15,459
Here, go get yourself a Mountain Dew.

416
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:17,212
Thanks.

417
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:26,272
Thanks for coming with us.

418
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:27,734
Sure.

419
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh, what are you doing?

420
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:37,879
I can't... I can't...

421
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:38,923
What...

422
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:43,515
They don't have any Mountain Dews left.
Can we go?

423
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:44,726
Please?

424
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:46,437
- Mm-hmm.
- Like now?

425
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:47,481
OK.

426
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:55,408
<i>That means a lot to me.</i>

427
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,111
<i>Welcome.</i>

428
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,490
<i>You've got mail.</i>

429
00:27:46,302 --> 00:27:47,639
<i>Computer...</i>

430
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:49,976
<i>Good-bye.</i>
