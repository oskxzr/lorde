- OK, so screen names...
- OK.

01:13.229 --> 01:15.568
So I have three options here for me...

01:15.818 --> 01:18.741
Stardust4eva, Sclub7...

01:18.866 --> 01:21.162
- which might be taken already...
- Mm-hmm.

01:21.245 --> 01:22.999
And Babyspice666.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.045
Isn't 666 like the Devil's number?

01:25.880 --> 01:26.880
No.

01:27.759 --> 01:31.099
Six is my favorite number
and my lucky number, so...

01:34.146 --> 01:35.273
Oh, my God!

01:37.529 --> 01:38.948
- Good job.
- I got mine.

01:41.995 --> 01:43.582
OK, cool, my turn.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.547
What do you mean?
I just signed on to mine.

01:46.630 --> 01:48.843
You got a screen name. Now it's my turn.

01:48.926 --> 01:50.345
But I haven't added any "Buddies".

01:50.429 --> 01:51.849
You, like, don't need to.

01:51.932 --> 01:54.855
You just have one buddy.
Your boyfriend buddy.

01:55.523 --> 01:57.192
Maya, that's not even funny.

01:57.276 --> 01:58.588
Like, we're barely boyfriend-girlfriend.

01:58.612 --> 01:59.531
Yeah, right.

01:59.614 --> 02:02.537
"Hi, Brendan. It's Anna.
I'm hogging the computer.

02:02.620 --> 02:03.620
I love you."

02:06.377 --> 02:08.674
Who's "hockey00?"

02:08.757 --> 02:10.385
It's Alex.

02:33.766 --> 02:34.893
Stop.

02:53.639 --> 02:55.141
So funny.

03:02.740 --> 03:04.326
My God!

03:04.953 --> 03:06.122
It's messed up.

03:06.205 --> 03:07.416
He probably got knocked off.

03:07.499 --> 03:09.169
- That's shady.
- That happens.

03:09.253 --> 03:10.756
That's not cool.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.927
- OK, let's talk to Sam.
- OK, fine.

03:13.011 --> 03:14.305
What's his screen name?

03:14.388 --> 03:15.307
OK.

03:15.390 --> 03:19.733
It is "LittlemanbigD1814"

03:20.233 --> 03:21.904
"Little man big D?"

03:22.864 --> 03:24.491
Ew!

03:28.041 --> 03:29.878
He's so nasty.

03:30.170 --> 03:31.757
It's funny, though.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.259
Type it in.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.640
Hey, hun. It's Anna.

03:36.265 --> 03:38.019
No, and me. Say, "Me, too."

03:38.102 --> 03:41.150
- Maya.
- Say, "Me" ah... "and Maya."

03:41.275 --> 03:42.275
OK.

03:50.544 --> 03:51.856
OK, he wants to know my screen name.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.174
I want to type.

03:53.257 --> 03:56.263
Don't have one yet. Dash from Maya.

04:01.107 --> 04:04.154
<i>Tell me when you do.
Dash from Sam. TTYL.</i>

04:06.200 --> 04:09.624
Oh, my God. Who's "Dogwigs2332?"

04:10.710 --> 04:12.087
Oh, my God, Brendan's online.

04:13.172 --> 04:14.425
Oh, my God!

04:17.807 --> 04:21.147
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. Should I respond?

04:21.230 --> 04:23.652
Like, what if Alex comes back on,
and I'm distracted.

04:23.736 --> 04:26.658
Yeah, but he's like your boyfriend,
so you have to respond.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.004
<i>Yeah, I know. WUWU?</i>

04:36.553 --> 04:37.889
"WUWU"?

04:38.891 --> 04:40.435
What the fuck is WUWU?

04:43.316 --> 04:45.821
Oh, my God.
He doesn't even know what WUWU means?

04:45.905 --> 04:47.950
I don't know what it means.
What does it mean?

04:48.034 --> 04:50.246
What's up with you.

04:50.330 --> 04:52.000
WUWU.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.881
<i>I can't believe
you don't know what that means.</i>

04:55.048 --> 04:56.133
<i>Smiley face.</i>

04:56.760 --> 04:58.346
OK, it's my turn.

04:58.722 --> 05:00.643
Maya, Brendan just IM'd me.

05:00.726 --> 05:01.996
No, let me set up my screen name.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.690
- Maya, we're talking.
- Give it.

05:03.774 --> 05:07.155
Stop! It's my turn!

05:07.239 --> 05:09.385
Please, don't break my keyboard.
Don't break my keyboard.

05:09.409 --> 05:13.961
Give it to me! Thank you. Finally, like...

05:14.044 --> 05:15.589
I just... OK, let me say good-bye.

05:15.673 --> 05:18.469
OK, say good-bye and then bye-bye forever.

05:23.772 --> 05:27.362
OK, screen name. So I'm gonna be...

05:28.699 --> 05:30.619
Viper911.

05:32.372 --> 05:35.003
- My God! What the eff! It's taken.
- I'm sorry, hun.

05:35.086 --> 05:37.758
- But look, AIM gives other options.
- Oh, yeah.

05:37.842 --> 05:40.096
Let me see.

05:40.681 --> 05:42.017
I'm just gonna do this one.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.687
- The "D" one?
- Yeah.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.941
It's Viper with a "D" 911.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.864
Diaper emergency!

05:50.826 --> 05:52.245
Think about it.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.001
I think it's, like, cool.

06:06.106 --> 06:08.528
<i>Waz up dingleberry?</i>

06:12.160 --> 06:15.918
<i>Oh, my God!
Your screen name what the eff!</i>

06:16.460 --> 06:19.550
Can I just check to see
if Brendan's still online?

06:19.634 --> 06:23.266
Anna, like, you were just talking to him.
You don't even like him that much.

06:25.436 --> 06:26.898
There he is.

06:26.982 --> 06:29.027
What's that thing next to his name?

06:31.616 --> 06:32.827
- It's weird.
- Oh, wait.

06:32.994 --> 06:34.706
He has a quote. It's like...

06:41.468 --> 06:42.888
Wait. That's about you.

06:42.972 --> 06:44.517
What do you mean?

06:44.976 --> 06:46.980
He's, like, obsessed with you.

06:47.063 --> 06:48.482
He wants to hug you.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.486
It's just an away message, Maya.

06:50.571 --> 06:52.449
OK, I wanna see who else is on.

06:54.244 --> 06:56.290
What the eff? Everyone's signing off.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.212
Have you ever been in a chatroom?

07:03.095 --> 07:05.349
OK, what's that one? M4m.

07:05.433 --> 07:06.936
Holy eff. No way, Maya!

07:07.020 --> 07:08.230
- What?
- Local one.

07:08.314 --> 07:09.984
"Hot people of Franklin County."

07:10.485 --> 07:12.155
Wait. Should we go in there?

07:12.907 --> 07:15.537
- Are we allowed?
- We're hot. We're in Franklin.

07:17.499 --> 07:21.298
OK, yeah, I guess they can't see
if we're hot or not, so just... do it.

07:21.381 --> 07:22.300
Do it.

07:22.383 --> 07:24.179
- Oh, my God.
- Uh, like, 16 people.

07:24.262 --> 07:26.308
Oh, my God.
This is so crazy.

07:26.391 --> 07:27.728
Say something.

07:27.812 --> 07:28.812
What do I say?

07:29.356 --> 07:31.360
- You do it.
- No, you do it.

07:31.443 --> 07:32.822
You do it.

07:33.657 --> 07:34.992
OK, fine.

07:35.536 --> 07:36.830
What do I say?

07:36.913 --> 07:40.963
OK. 'Sup hotties?

07:41.589 --> 07:44.887
I'm hot girl.

07:44.971 --> 07:46.223
Maya!

07:46.808 --> 07:48.435
Oh, my God.

07:49.354 --> 07:51.275
Wait. It's, like, going so fast,

07:51.358 --> 07:53.112
you know, it, like, gets lost.

07:53.195 --> 07:54.866
OK, Maya, "PhuckMaStick" just said "asl".

07:55.491 --> 07:56.870
What does "asl" stand for?

08:01.420 --> 08:03.550
Oh, my God. Can he see?

08:04.217 --> 08:06.806
Of course not.
My dad doesn't have a webcam.

08:06.973 --> 08:10.146
- Accept or decline?
- You do it. You do it.

08:10.814 --> 08:12.025
- Cool.
- Accept.

08:12.108 --> 08:13.108
OK.

08:14.530 --> 08:17.202
'Sup, baby.
How hot are you? Show me!

08:19.957 --> 08:21.460
- My God!
- Oh, my God!

08:21.544 --> 08:23.339
- Oh, my God, Maya.
- Oh, my God, 'Na, stop!

08:23.422 --> 08:24.818
- You're freaking me out.
- You're freaking me out.

08:24.842 --> 08:25.761
Stop!

08:25.844 --> 08:28.432
Hey, I need to use the phone right now...

08:28.516 --> 08:30.019
so IM time is over.

08:30.186 --> 08:31.856
Got it.

08:33.025 --> 08:34.402
Like, now.

08:34.486 --> 08:36.031
- OK.
- OK.

08:36.365 --> 08:37.408
Look out.

08:38.536 --> 08:39.538
<i>Good-bye.</i>

08:41.124 --> 08:43.379
Listen, Sam,
it was, like, so messed up.

08:43.462 --> 08:45.216
It was crazy, crazy-crazy.

08:45.299 --> 08:47.011
Wait. You talked to some guy in town?

08:47.428 --> 08:49.892
Well, he can't find you
unless you've told him where you live.

08:50.017 --> 08:53.399
Are you say... We were in a room
for Franklin County for hot people,

08:53.482 --> 08:55.236
like, that's what we were in.

08:55.319 --> 08:56.948
<i>He doesn't know your name.
Does he?</i>

08:57.658 --> 09:00.204
Sam, you're scaring us. Why?

09:00.288 --> 09:03.085
Sam, stop. No.
He just knows our screen names, like...

09:03.168 --> 09:05.047
You're fine, Diper911.

09:05.131 --> 09:06.843
It's just for guys who wanna hook up.

09:08.429 --> 09:10.892
All right. I'm gonna hang up now.
Later, losers.

09:10.976 --> 09:12.437
Bye.

09:14.399 --> 09:16.028
Oh, my God.

09:16.111 --> 09:18.282
Stop. It's my mom. It's my mom.

09:18.365 --> 09:20.369
Jesus!

09:20.453 --> 09:22.332
- Love you.
- Love you, Anna.

09:23.208 --> 09:24.503
Maya.

09:41.495 --> 09:44.334
No. Frickin' like, "Do your homework."

09:46.213 --> 09:49.177
Sponges and sea stars,
like, it's not that hard.

10:06.838 --> 10:10.554
<i>♪ Toc, tic, toc, tic ♪</i>

10:10.887 --> 10:12.098
<i>♪ Toc ♪</i>

10:20.907 --> 10:22.243
- Maya?
- <i>Welcome!</i>

10:22.410 --> 10:24.080
Are you done with your homework?

10:24.164 --> 10:26.502
<i>- You've got mail.</i>
- Yeah. I'm doing it.

10:26.586 --> 10:28.464
Like, I need the computer

10:28.548 --> 10:30.384
for a research project, so...

10:30.635 --> 10:32.054
Research project?

10:32.138 --> 10:34.184
Yeah. It's due tomorrow.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.856
Tomorrow? Well, then hurry up
and finish it.

10:36.939 --> 10:41.156
Duh! It's literally what I'm doing,
so can you leave me alone, please?

10:41.824 --> 10:43.076
OK.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.496
So... I heard something today

11:05.580 --> 11:09.797
while I was, um,
driving Anna and Maya home.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.551
They were whispering, but...

11:13.095 --> 11:14.095
What?

11:14.389 --> 11:16.142
You have a boyfriend.

11:17.353 --> 11:20.025
- What?
- Mom, what, you spying on us?

11:20.109 --> 11:22.656
Who? Someone we know?

11:22.739 --> 11:23.992
Brandon.

11:24.075 --> 11:26.747
Mom, it's Brendan. It's not Brandon.

11:27.373 --> 11:28.585
You're not even a good spy,

11:28.710 --> 11:30.839
and we're just taking it
really, really slow.

11:30.922 --> 11:32.676
We just barely started going out.

11:32.759 --> 11:33.845
Is he a catch?

11:34.889 --> 11:37.226
Because you are catch. Kinda major catch.

11:37.769 --> 11:43.196
Curtis, is this from Wok N' Roll
or Shanghai?

11:43.280 --> 11:46.871
Because Wok N' Roll is the one
that made me sick

11:46.954 --> 11:48.373
after your mole removal.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.670
I thought that was Shanghai, so...

11:50.712 --> 11:52.716
OK, so this is Wok N' Roll.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.972
Seriously I reminded you this morning
before you left.

11:56.056 --> 11:57.643
<i>Now again you made me...</i>

11:57.726 --> 11:58.853
<i>It's Chinese food.</i>

11:58.937 --> 12:00.189
<i>No, it's not Chinese food.</i>

12:00.272 --> 12:01.651
<i>That one place makes me sick,</i>

12:01.734 --> 12:03.153
<i>and the other place doesn't.</i>

12:19.645 --> 12:22.233
I'm calling Anna for homework help.

12:26.751 --> 12:27.755
OK.

12:36.595 --> 12:38.348
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Oh, my God, 'Na!

12:38.432 --> 12:40.520
I'm back
in "Hot people of Franklin County."

12:40.603 --> 12:42.816
Oh, my God, you're back in?

12:42.899 --> 12:44.570
<i>There's like 19 people in here.</i>

12:44.653 --> 12:45.697
What are they saying?

12:45.780 --> 12:49.037
They're saying so many things,
like, "discrete?"

12:49.621 --> 12:51.751
"Purple pussy cat."

12:51.834 --> 12:54.464
- "Looking to play."
- <i>You love playing.</i>

12:55.592 --> 12:56.903
Oh, my God, some random guy
just IM'd me again.

12:56.927 --> 12:58.765
- 'Na...
- <i>Oh, my God, Maya, be careful.</i>

12:58.848 --> 13:00.267
<i>Remember last time.</i>

13:00.350 --> 13:02.396
Flymiamibro22.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.943
- <i>That's a hot screen name.</i>
- Yeah.

13:05.486 --> 13:07.616
OK, I'm clicking on it.

13:07.741 --> 13:10.955
He says, "Hey, hottie. Zup.
What you look like?"

13:11.039 --> 13:14.212
Oh, my God, 'Na, he thinks I'm hot,
and he's saying hi. Help me.

13:14.295 --> 13:16.335
- What do I say back?
- <i>Well, he can't find our age.</i>

13:16.382 --> 13:17.511
Yeah, obviously.

13:17.594 --> 13:19.388
OK, let's just say we're like...

13:20.558 --> 13:22.478
Well, um...

13:23.146 --> 13:26.111
We are both 13, so, like, 13 plus 13,
that's like 26.

13:26.194 --> 13:28.156
I'm just gonna say we're 26.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.827
<i>Say we have blonde hair
and brown eyes,</i>

13:29.910 --> 13:32.164
<i>- like, if we were one person.</i>
- OK. I love that.

13:32.248 --> 13:35.839
Blonde hair. Brown eyes.

13:39.930 --> 13:41.642
Oh, my God, he thinks we're hot.

13:42.894 --> 13:44.021
OK, wait.

13:44.105 --> 13:48.071
He's 30. He's a computer programmer
and a total gym rat.

13:48.154 --> 13:51.829
Oh, my God, he's a freaking gym rat.
That's like...

13:52.288 --> 13:54.000
what is that?

13:54.333 --> 13:57.214
OK. Are you hot?

13:57.298 --> 13:59.218
<i>Um, it's a chatroom
for hot people.</i>

13:59.302 --> 14:00.513
<i>- Remember?</i>
- Shh!

14:02.182 --> 14:03.226
Oh, my God, he says,

14:03.310 --> 14:05.147
"People tell me I'm hot but I am humble.

14:05.230 --> 14:06.692
It's not for me to say."

14:06.775 --> 14:07.903
That means he's hot.

14:07.986 --> 14:09.666
Wait, that's what people say that are hot.

14:09.698 --> 14:10.575
<i>I know.</i>

14:10.658 --> 14:13.581
I'm, like, into this guy.

14:13.664 --> 14:16.044
Oh, Maya, can you hold on?
I just have call waiting.

14:16.127 --> 14:17.338
OK.

14:19.258 --> 14:20.427
Hello?

14:20.511 --> 14:22.473
<i>Hi. Can I please
speak to Anna please?</i>

14:22.557 --> 14:24.352
<i>This is Brendan Tooler speaking.</i>

14:24.978 --> 14:26.397
Hi. It's Anna.

14:26.732 --> 14:27.817
<i>Uh, hi.</i>

14:28.527 --> 14:30.865
What's up? You called...

14:30.949 --> 14:32.201
<i>Yeah, is that cool?</i>

14:33.328 --> 14:35.792
Yeah, I just... I'm talking to
Maya on the other line

14:35.875 --> 14:37.754
so I'm just gonna have to...

14:37.837 --> 14:40.635
um, tell her that I'll call her back,
I guess.

14:40.718 --> 14:41.971
<i>Oh. OK, sure.</i>

14:42.262 --> 14:43.473
OK, hold on.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.354
- Maya?
- <i>What?</i>

14:46.437 --> 14:47.941
Oh, my God, Brendan just called me.

14:48.024 --> 14:49.778
- <i>Wait. Really?</i>
- Like...

14:49.861 --> 14:51.090
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- Are you kidding?

14:51.114 --> 14:52.742
<i>Anna, this is like real...</i>

14:52.826 --> 14:55.223
Um, can I call you back
and just talk to him for a minute, like...

14:55.247 --> 14:56.709
No. Go, go, go.

14:56.792 --> 14:58.838
I'm talking to Flymiami.

14:59.422 --> 15:00.818
<i>Well, you're still
chatting with him?</i>

15:00.842 --> 15:01.842
I know it's crazy.

15:01.927 --> 15:04.306
- <i>Progress check in the morning.</i>
- OK.

15:04.390 --> 15:05.935
- <i>OK. Be good over there, bye!</i>
- Bye.

15:13.701 --> 15:16.999
I like nature too.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.921
Sand dunes.

15:20.005 --> 15:22.552
Ha. JK.

15:24.013 --> 15:25.057
Mm.

15:26.184 --> 15:27.937
I shouldn't have said that.

15:36.830 --> 15:38.083
That's like...

16:31.648 --> 16:33.443
<i>Yo, girl,
you got an email address?</i>

16:33.527 --> 16:35.071
<i>Yeah, I'll give it to you, hottie.</i>

16:35.155 --> 16:36.658
- That's hot.
- You're hot.

16:36.742 --> 16:39.014
- You're so fricking hot.
- I've never felt this way before.

16:39.038 --> 16:40.798
- Me neither. My heart's gonna burst.
- Bang!

16:40.833 --> 16:42.754

- You could take it, bitch.

16:42.837 --> 16:43.982
Because I'm in heaven with you right now.

16:44.006 --> 16:45.606
- Bury me.
- When I think of other girls,

16:45.635 --> 16:46.637
I wanna barf my guts out.

16:46.720 --> 16:50.435
I wanna eat that barf and guts up
like a big, old bowl of lentil soup.

16:50.519 --> 16:51.813
Yum, yum, yum, yum...

16:51.897 --> 16:53.459
Sometimes there's so much beauty
in the world

16:53.483 --> 16:54.401
I feel like I can't take it.

16:54.485 --> 16:56.740
I love you more than I love my own dad.

16:56.865 --> 16:57.867
- Maya-chan!
- Aah!

16:57.951 --> 16:59.370
Why are you still up?

17:03.545 --> 17:05.633
I just finished the research project.

17:06.802 --> 17:08.806
- Go to bed.
- OK.

17:15.611 --> 17:17.322
I think I'm in love.

17:19.744 --> 17:21.122
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.207
- Mai?
- Yeah.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.003
- That's a really big word.
- No, I know.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.382
And you just like, barely know him
is the only thing.

17:26.465 --> 17:28.637
No, I know, but, like,
sometimes you can just tell.

17:28.721 --> 17:31.076
- You haven't met him yet?
- It's from the way we're talking.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.100
Wassup, Maya?

17:33.104 --> 17:34.104
Hey.

17:34.356 --> 17:37.864
See. Even Evan's way less hot to me
since I met Flymiamibro.

17:37.947 --> 17:40.620
- That's how you know.
- Oh, my God. Don't look.

17:40.703 --> 17:42.289
Hey, Anna. Hey, Maya.

17:42.372 --> 17:43.542
- Hey, Brendan.
- Hey.

17:44.836 --> 17:46.088
I burned this for you.

17:50.556 --> 17:51.892
'Cause you said you love music.

17:54.396 --> 17:55.858
You don't have to listen to it.

17:56.902 --> 17:58.947
No, I do love music. Thank you.

17:59.949 --> 18:01.243
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.422
Oh, my God,
he's, like, in love with you.

18:07.507 --> 18:09.194
- We talked for hours last night.
- Wait. Really?

18:09.218 --> 18:10.554
It's all moving too fast.

18:10.638 --> 18:12.850
No, I think it's moving exactly
the right speed.

18:12.934 --> 18:13.977

and send it to Flymiamibro.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.173
- No.
- Why?

19:31.257 --> 19:33.427
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No. Yes, it is.

19:33.512 --> 19:35.032
It's just not something
we should be doing.

19:35.056 --> 19:38.312
It's just like a picture of me
so he can know what I look like.

19:38.689 --> 19:40.943
- No. We are not doing it.
- No... Anna, yes.

19:41.026 --> 19:42.655
Maya, I'm putting my foot down.

19:42.738 --> 19:44.116
Absolutely not.

19:49.167 --> 19:50.211
That's hot.

19:50.295 --> 19:52.090
And make sure you're getting the boob too.

19:52.424 --> 19:53.677
Sure, do.

19:55.430 --> 19:56.808
OK, let me see it.

19:56.850 --> 19:58.008
Let me see.

19:59.229 --> 20:00.774
Oh, My God.

20:01.651 --> 20:03.947
That looks bad. That's blurry.

20:04.031 --> 20:06.578
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, wait, I like that one.

20:06.995 --> 20:08.414
That's good.

20:08.497 --> 20:10.460
Showing a lot. Um...

20:11.671 --> 20:13.049
How about just this one?

20:14.217 --> 20:16.430
That's literally just my hand.

20:16.514 --> 20:18.017
I know but it's beautiful.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.900
OK.

20:21.983 --> 20:24.279
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. I'm gonna send it.

20:26.492 --> 20:27.494
Oh, my God.

20:27.578 --> 20:29.832
Stop it! stop it!
Anna, Anna, stop.

20:29.916 --> 20:31.687
- What if he doesn't think it's pretty?
- I can't believe you just did that.

20:31.711 --> 20:33.507
What if he doesn't think it's pretty?

20:33.924 --> 20:35.511
Oh my God, he already responded.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.598
"So hot."

20:42.942 --> 20:45.321
OK, I'm sorry, we have to meet.

20:46.783 --> 20:48.035
- What?
- Ssh!

20:48.119 --> 20:50.666
I have to meet you...

20:50.749 --> 20:52.085
- Maya, don't send that.
- Stop.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.047
- In person.
- Maya, don't send that.

20:56.928 --> 20:58.932
- No. Don't send that.
- I sent it.

20:59.349 --> 21:00.393
I sent it.

21:00.728 --> 21:02.606
- Maya!
- Stop.

21:10.288 --> 21:11.833
Oh, my God!

21:16.801 --> 21:18.429
Are you like so nervous?

21:18.930 --> 21:21.185
- I mean... a little.
- Yeah?

21:21.268 --> 21:22.479
Yeah.

21:22.563 --> 21:24.692
It's like I know he's the one, you know.

21:24.776 --> 21:26.320
Who are you guys talking about?

21:26.403 --> 21:27.758
None of your freaking business, Jafeer.

21:27.782 --> 21:30.328
Yeah, it's none of your freaking business.

21:30.746 --> 21:32.499
If you really want to know...

21:33.084 --> 21:34.294
I've met someone.

21:35.088 --> 21:37.342
Or I'm about to meet him after school.

21:37.425 --> 21:39.847
Wait, you haven't met him in person yet?

21:40.306 --> 21:43.062
- That's shady.
- Oh, no, we've talked on AIM like a lot.

21:43.145 --> 21:46.736
He's probably some wart-y old dude,
who has a beer belly

21:46.820 --> 21:48.782
or suit socks and lives with his mother.

21:48.865 --> 21:52.623
Or he's a computer genius
with a tight bod, Jafeer.

21:52.706 --> 21:55.306
- Like you wouldn't even...
- Can we just change the conversation?

21:55.671 --> 21:57.423
- What?
- Start a new one.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.261
We weren't even talking to you.

21:59.804 --> 22:01.181
It's just kinda lame.

22:01.265 --> 22:03.979
- OK, well...
- OK, well, stop... like, don't listen.

22:04.396 --> 22:06.526
- Anyway, Mai?
- What?

22:06.609 --> 22:09.281
I'm like, so excited for you, honestly.

22:09.406 --> 22:11.034
- I really, really am.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:11.118 --> 22:13.289
- I just wanna ask one quick question.
- OK, what?

22:13.372 --> 22:14.810
Are you sure that you want to meet him,

22:14.834 --> 22:16.713
because what if he's pissed
that you're a kid.

22:19.510 --> 22:22.182
I don't think that's a possibility,
like, I don't.

22:22.516 --> 22:24.144
- OK.
- I'm not gonna stand him up.

22:24.227 --> 22:25.479
I couldn't do that to him...

22:26.106 --> 22:28.068
- Right. OK.
- You know. Yeah.

22:29.070 --> 22:31.158
- I just feel like we need back up.
- Yeah.

22:31.366 --> 22:33.955
- Yeah.
- Like someone that can protect us.

22:34.582 --> 22:35.751
We should ask Brendan.

22:45.646 --> 22:46.898
'Sup, B?

22:47.482 --> 22:48.482
Spencer.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.146
You're OK, Maya? Can I get you some water?

22:58.170 --> 22:59.214
I'm good.

22:59.882 --> 23:01.468
I'm good. Don't leave.

23:03.556 --> 23:07.146
What if he gets mad when he sees me
that I don't look like what I said I look?

23:07.940 --> 23:09.025
Maya, you're fine.

23:09.109 --> 23:11.488
You're fine as hell. You're finer
than you even described.

23:11.572 --> 23:12.574
Yeah.

23:12.658 --> 23:15.246
And maybe he doesn't look like
how he described himself.

23:15.329 --> 23:17.125
I mean, he could really be
anybody in here.

25:23.545 --> 25:25.172
Thanks for coming with us.

25:25.256 --> 25:26.634
Sure.

25:33.731 --> 25:34.900
Oh, what are you doing?

25:34.984 --> 25:36.779
I can't... I can't...

25:36.862 --> 25:37.862
What...

25:39.868 --> 25:42.415
They don't have any Mountain Dews left.
Can we go?

25:42.498 --> 25:43.626
Please?

25:44.252 --> 25:45.337
- Mm-hmm.
- Like now?

25:45.421 --> 25:46.421
OK.

26:52.848 --> 26:54.308
<i>That means a lot to me.</i>

27:31.967 --> 27:33.011
<i>Welcome.</i>

27:33.721 --> 27:35.390
<i>You've got mail.</i>

27:45.202 --> 27:46.539
<i>Computer...</i>

27:48.041 --> 27:49.041
<i>Good-bye.</i>
