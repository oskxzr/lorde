- OK, so screen names...
- OK.

9
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,568
So I have three options here for me...

10
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:18,741
Stardust4eva, Sclub7...

11
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:21,162
- which might be taken already...
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:22,999
And Babyspice666.

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,045
Isn't 666 like the Devil's number?

14
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
No.

15
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,099
Six is my favorite number
and my lucky number, so...

16
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:35,273
Oh, my God!

17
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:38,948
- Good job.
- I got mine.

18
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:43,582
OK, cool, my turn.

19
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,547
What do you mean?
I just signed on to mine.

20
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,843
You got a screen name. Now it's my turn.

21
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:50,345
But I haven't added any "Buddies".

22
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:51,849
You, like, don't need to.

23
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:54,855
You just have one buddy.
Your boyfriend buddy.

24
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:57,192
Maya, that's not even funny.

25
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:58,588
Like, we're barely boyfriend-girlfriend.

26
00:01:58,612 --> 00:01:59,531
Yeah, right.

27
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:02,537
"Hi, Brendan. It's Anna.
I'm hogging the computer.

28
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,620
I love you."

29
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:08,674
Who's "hockey00?"

30
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:10,385
It's Alex.

31
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:34,893
Stop.

32
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,141
So funny.

33
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,326
My God!

34
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:06,122
It's messed up.

35
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:07,416
He probably got knocked off.

36
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,169
- That's shady.
- That happens.

37
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:10,756
That's not cool.

38
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,927
- OK, let's talk to Sam.
- OK, fine.

39
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:14,305
What's his screen name?

40
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:15,307
OK.

41
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,733
It is "LittlemanbigD1814"

42
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,904
"Little man big D?"

43
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:24,491
Ew!

44
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,878
He's so nasty.

45
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,757
It's funny, though.

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,259
Type it in.

47
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:35,640
Hey, hun. It's Anna.

48
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,019
No, and me. Say, "Me, too."

49
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:41,150
- Maya.
- Say, "Me" ah... "and Maya."

50
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:42,275
OK.

51
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:51,856
OK, he wants to know my screen name.

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,174
I want to type.

53
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:56,263
Don't have one yet. Dash from Maya.

54
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,154
<i>Tell me when you do.
Dash from Sam. TTYL.</i>

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,624
Oh, my God. Who's "Dogwigs2332?"

56
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,087
Oh, my God, Brendan's online.

57
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,425
Oh, my God!

58
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:21,147
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. Should I respond?

59
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,652
Like, what if Alex comes back on,
and I'm distracted.

60
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:26,658
Yeah, but he's like your boyfriend,
so you have to respond.

61
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,004
<i>Yeah, I know. WUWU?</i>

62
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:37,889
"WUWU"?

63
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,435
What the fuck is WUWU?

64
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,821
Oh, my God.
He doesn't even know what WUWU means?

65
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,950
I don't know what it means.
What does it mean?

66
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:50,246
What's up with you.

67
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,000
WUWU.

68
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,881
<i>I can't believe
you don't know what that means.</i>

69
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,133
<i>Smiley face.</i>

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,346
OK, it's my turn.

71
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:00,643
Maya, Brendan just IM'd me.

72
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:01,996
No, let me set up my screen name.

73
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,690
- Maya, we're talking.
- Give it.

74
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:07,155
Stop! It's my turn!

75
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,385
Please, don't break my keyboard.
Don't break my keyboard.

76
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,961
Give it to me! Thank you. Finally, like...

77
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:15,589
I just... OK, let me say good-bye.

78
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:18,469
OK, say good-bye and then bye-bye forever.

79
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:27,362
OK, screen name. So I'm gonna be...

80
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,619
Viper911.

81
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:35,003
- My God! What the eff! It's taken.
- I'm sorry, hun.

82
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,758
- But look, AIM gives other options.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:40,096
Let me see.

84
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:42,017
I'm just gonna do this one.

85
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,687
- The "D" one?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,941
It's Viper with a "D" 911.

87
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,864
Diaper emergency!

88
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:52,245
Think about it.

89
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,001
I think it's, like, cool.

90
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:08,528
<i>Waz up dingleberry?</i>

91
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,918
<i>Oh, my God!
Your screen name what the eff!</i>

92
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,550
Can I just check to see
if Brendan's still online?

93
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:23,266
Anna, like, you were just talking to him.
You don't even like him that much.

94
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:26,898
There he is.

95
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:29,027
What's that thing next to his name?

96
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:32,827
- It's weird.
- Oh, wait.

97
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:34,706
He has a quote. It's like...

98
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,888
Wait. That's about you.

99
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:44,517
What do you mean?

100
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,980
He's, like, obsessed with you.

101
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:48,482
He wants to hug you.

102
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,486
It's just an away message, Maya.

103
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,449
OK, I wanna see who else is on.

104
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:56,290
What the eff? Everyone's signing off.

105
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,212
Have you ever been in a chatroom?

106
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:05,349
OK, what's that one? M4m.

107
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,936
Holy eff. No way, Maya!

108
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,230
- What?
- Local one.

109
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:09,984
"Hot people of Franklin County."

110
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,155
Wait. Should we go in there?

111
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:15,537
- Are we allowed?
- We're hot. We're in Franklin.

112
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:21,298
OK, yeah, I guess they can't see
if we're hot or not, so just... do it.

113
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:22,300
Do it.

114
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:24,179
- Oh, my God.
- Uh, like, 16 people.

115
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:26,308
Oh, my God.
This is so crazy.

116
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,728
Say something.

117
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:28,812
What do I say?

118
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:31,360
- You do it.
- No, you do it.

119
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:32,822
You do it.

120
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:34,992
OK, fine.

121
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:36,830
What do I say?

122
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:40,963
OK. 'Sup hotties?

123
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:44,887
I'm hot girl.

124
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:46,223
Maya!

125
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:48,435
Oh, my God.

126
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:51,275
Wait. It's, like, going so fast,

127
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:53,112
you know, it, like, gets lost.

128
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:54,866
OK, Maya, "PhuckMaStick" just said "asl".

129
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:56,870
What does "asl" stand for?

130
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,550
Oh, my God. Can he see?

131
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,806
Of course not.
My dad doesn't have a webcam.

132
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:10,146
- Accept or decline?
- You do it. You do it.

133
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,025
- Cool.
- Accept.

134
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,108
OK.

135
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,202
'Sup, baby.
How hot are you? Show me!

136
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,460
- My God!
- Oh, my God!

137
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,339
- Oh, my God, Maya.
- Oh, my God, 'Na, stop!

138
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:24,818
- You're freaking me out.
- You're freaking me out.

139
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:25,761
Stop!

140
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:28,432
Hey, I need to use the phone right now...

141
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,019
so IM time is over.

142
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:31,856
Got it.

143
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,402
Like, now.

144
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:36,031
- OK.
- OK.

145
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,408
Look out.

146
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:39,538
<i>Good-bye.</i>

147
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:43,379
Listen, Sam,
it was, like, so messed up.

148
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,216
It was crazy, crazy-crazy.

149
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,011
Wait. You talked to some guy in town?

150
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,892
Well, he can't find you
unless you've told him where you live.

151
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:53,399
Are you say... We were in a room
for Franklin County for hot people,

152
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:55,236
like, that's what we were in.

153
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:56,948
<i>He doesn't know your name.
Does he?</i>

154
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,204
Sam, you're scaring us. Why?

155
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,085
Sam, stop. No.
He just knows our screen names, like...

156
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,047
You're fine, Diper911.

157
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,843
It's just for guys who wanna hook up.

158
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:10,892
All right. I'm gonna hang up now.
Later, losers.

159
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,437
Bye.

160
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,028
Oh, my God.

161
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,282
Stop. It's my mom. It's my mom.

162
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:20,369
Jesus!

163
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:22,332
- Love you.
- Love you, Anna.

164
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,503
Maya.

165
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:44,334
No. Frickin' like, "Do your homework."

166
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:49,177
Sponges and sea stars,
like, it's not that hard.

<i>- You've got mail.</i>
- Yeah. I'm doing it.

172
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,464
Like, I need the computer

173
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:30,384
for a research project, so...

174
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,054
Research project?

175
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:34,184
Yeah. It's due tomorrow.

176
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,856
Tomorrow? Well, then hurry up
and finish it.

177
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:41,156
Duh! It's literally what I'm doing,
so can you leave me alone, please?

178
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,076
OK.

179
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,496
So... I heard something today

180
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,797
while I was, um,
driving Anna and Maya home.

181
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,551
They were whispering, but...

182
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:14,095
What?

183
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:16,142
You have a boyfriend.

184
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:20,025
- What?
- Mom, what, you spying on us?

185
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:22,656
Who? Someone we know?

186
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:23,992
Brandon.

187
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,747
Mom, it's Brendan. It's not Brandon.

188
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:28,585
You're not even a good spy,

189
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,839
and we're just taking it
really, really slow.

190
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:32,676
We just barely started going out.

191
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,845
Is he a catch?

192
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,226
Because you are catch. Kinda major catch.

193
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:43,196
Curtis, is this from Wok N' Roll
or Shanghai?

194
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,871
Because Wok N' Roll is the one
that made me sick

195
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:48,373
after your mole removal.

196
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,670
I thought that was Shanghai, so...

197
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:52,716
OK, so this is Wok N' Roll.

198
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,972
Seriously I reminded you this morning
before you left.

199
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:57,643
<i>Now again you made me...</i>

200
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:58,853
<i>It's Chinese food.</i>

201
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:00,189
<i>No, it's not Chinese food.</i>

202
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:01,651
<i>That one place makes me sick,</i>

203
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:03,153
<i>and the other place doesn't.</i>

204
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:22,233
I'm calling Anna for homework help.

205
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,755
OK.

206
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:38,348
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Oh, my God, 'Na!

207
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,520
I'm back
in "Hot people of Franklin County."

208
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:42,816
Oh, my God, you're back in?

209
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,570
<i>There's like 19 people in here.</i>

210
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:45,697
What are they saying?

211
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,037
They're saying so many things,
like, "discrete?"

212
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:51,751
"Purple pussy cat."

213
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:54,464
- "Looking to play."
- <i>You love playing.</i>

214
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:56,903
Oh, my God, some random guy
just IM'd me again.

215
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:58,765
- 'Na...
- <i>Oh, my God, Maya, be careful.</i>

216
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,267
<i>Remember last time.</i>

217
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,396
Flymiamibro22.

218
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,943
- <i>That's a hot screen name.</i>
- Yeah.

219
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,616
OK, I'm clicking on it.

220
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:10,955
He says, "Hey, hottie. Zup.
What you look like?"

221
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,212
Oh, my God, 'Na, he thinks I'm hot,
and he's saying hi. Help me.

222
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:16,335
- What do I say back?
- <i>Well, he can't find our age.</i>

223
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:17,511
Yeah, obviously.

224
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:19,388
OK, let's just say we're like...

225
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:22,478
Well, um...

226
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:26,111
We are both 13, so, like, 13 plus 13,
that's like 26.

227
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,156
I'm just gonna say we're 26.

228
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,827
<i>Say we have blonde hair
and brown eyes,</i>

229
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,164
<i>- like, if we were one person.</i>
- OK. I love that.

230
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:35,839
Blonde hair. Brown eyes.

231
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,642
Oh, my God, he thinks we're hot.

232
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:44,021
OK, wait.

233
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:48,071
He's 30. He's a computer programmer
and a total gym rat.

234
00:13:48,154 --> 00:13:51,829
Oh, my God, he's a freaking gym rat.
That's like...

235
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,000
what is that?

236
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,214
OK. Are you hot?

237
00:13:57,298 --> 00:13:59,218
<i>Um, it's a chatroom
for hot people.</i>

238
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:00,513
<i>- Remember?</i>
- Shh!

239
00:14:02,182 --> 00:14:03,226
Oh, my God, he says,

240
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,147
"People tell me I'm hot but I am humble.

241
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,692
It's not for me to say."

242
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:07,903
That means he's hot.

243
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:09,666
Wait, that's what people say that are hot.

244
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:10,575
<i>I know.</i>

245
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:13,581
I'm, like, into this guy.

246
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:16,044
Oh, Maya, can you hold on?
I just have call waiting.

247
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:17,338
OK.

248
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,427
Hello?

249
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:22,473
<i>Hi. Can I please
speak to Anna please?</i>

250
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,352
<i>This is Brendan Tooler speaking.</i>

251
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:26,397
Hi. It's Anna.

252
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:27,817
<i>Uh, hi.</i>

253
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:30,865
What's up? You called...

254
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:32,201
<i>Yeah, is that cool?</i>

255
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:35,792
Yeah, I just... I'm talking to
Maya on the other line

256
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,754
so I'm just gonna have to...

257
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:40,635
um, tell her that I'll call her back,
I guess.

258
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:41,971
<i>Oh. OK, sure.</i>

259
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:43,473
OK, hold on.

260
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,354
- Maya?
- <i>What?</i>

261
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:47,941
Oh, my God, Brendan just called me.

262
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:49,778
- <i>Wait. Really?</i>
- Like...

263
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:51,090
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- Are you kidding?

264
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:52,742
<i>Anna, this is like real...</i>

265
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,223
Um, can I call you back
and just talk to him for a minute, like...

266
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:56,709
No. Go, go, go.

267
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,838
I'm talking to Flymiami.

268
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:00,818
<i>Well, you're still
chatting with him?</i>

269
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:01,842
I know it's crazy.

270
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:04,306
- <i>Progress check in the morning.</i>
- OK.

271
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,935
- <i>OK. Be good over there, bye!</i>
- Bye.

272
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,999
I like nature too.

273
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,921
Sand dunes.

274
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:22,552
Ha. JK.

275
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:25,057
Mm.

276
00:15:26,184 --> 00:15:27,937
I shouldn't have said that.

277
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,083
That's like...

278
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:47,230
<i>♪ Yeah... ♪</i>

279
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:03,884

281
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:26,053
Flymiamibro?

282
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:27,847
'Sup?

283
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:33,443
<i>Yo, girl,
you got an email address?</i>

284
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,071
<i>Yeah, I'll give it to you, hottie.</i>

285
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:36,658
- That's hot.
- You're hot.

286
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:39,014
- You're so fricking hot.
- I've never felt this way before.

287
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:40,798
- Me neither. My heart's gonna burst.
- Bang!

288
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,754
- Am I dead?
- You could take it, bitch.

289
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:43,982
Because I'm in heaven with you right now.

290
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,606
- Bury me.
- When I think of other girls,

291
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:46,637
I wanna barf my guts out.

292
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,435
I wanna eat that barf and guts up
like a big, old bowl of lentil soup.

293
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,813
Yum, yum, yum, yum...

294
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:53,459
Sometimes there's so much beauty
in the world

295
00:16:53,483 --> 00:16:54,401
I feel like I can't take it.

296
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:56,740
I love you more than I love my own dad.

297
00:16:56,865 --> 00:16:57,867
- Maya-chan!
- Aah!

298
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,370
Why are you still up?

299
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:05,633
I just finished the research project.

300
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:08,806
- Go to bed.
- OK.

301
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:17,322
I think I'm in love.

302
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:21,122
- Wow.
- Yeah.

303
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:22,207
- Mai?
- Yeah.

304
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,003
- That's a really big word.
- No, I know.

305
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,382
And you just like, barely know him
is the only thing.

306
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,637
No, I know, but, like,
sometimes you can just tell.

307
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:31,076
- You haven't met him yet?
- It's from the way we're talking.

308
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
Wassup, Maya?

309
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,104
Hey.

310
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:37,864
See. Even Evan's way less hot to me
since I met Flymiamibro.

311
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:40,620
- That's how you know.
- Oh, my God. Don't look.

312
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:42,289
Hey, Anna. Hey, Maya.

313
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:43,542
- Hey, Brendan.
- Hey.

314
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,088
I burned this for you.

315
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:51,892
'Cause you said you love music.

316
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:55,858
You don't have to listen to it.

317
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:58,947
No, I do love music. Thank you.

318
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,243
- Bye.
- Bye.

319
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,422
Oh, my God,
he's, like, in love with you.

320
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:09,194
- We talked for hours last night.
- Wait. Really?

321
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,554
It's all moving too fast.

322
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:12,850
No, I think it's moving exactly
the right speed.

323
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:13,977
I do.

349
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,427
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No. Yes, it is.

350
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:35,032
It's just not something
we should be doing.

351
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:38,312
It's just like a picture of me
so he can know what I look like.

352
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:40,943
- No. We are not doing it.
- No... Anna, yes.

353
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,655
Maya, I'm putting my foot down.

354
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:44,116
Absolutely not.

355
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,211
That's hot.

356
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:52,090
And make sure you're getting the boob too.

357
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,677
Sure, do.

358
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,808
OK, let me see it.

359
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,008
Let me see.

360
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:00,774
Oh, My God.

361
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,947
That looks bad. That's blurry.

362
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:06,578
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, wait, I like that one.

363
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:08,414
That's good.

364
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:10,460
Showing a lot. Um...

365
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:13,049
How about just this one?

366
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:16,430
That's literally just my hand.

367
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:18,017
I know but it's beautiful.

368
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,900
OK.

369
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:24,279
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. I'm gonna send it.

370
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,494
Oh, my God.

371
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:29,832
Stop it! stop it!
Anna, Anna, stop.

372
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,687
- What if he doesn't think it's pretty?
- I can't believe you just did that.

373
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:33,507
What if he doesn't think it's pretty?

374
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:35,511
Oh my God, he already responded.

375
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:37,598
"So hot."

376
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,321
OK, I'm sorry, we have to meet.

377
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,035
- What?
- Ssh!

378
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,666
I have to meet you...

379
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,085
- Maya, don't send that.
- Stop.

380
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,047
- In person.
- Maya, don't send that.

381
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:58,932
- No. Don't send that.
- I sent it.

382
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:00,393
I sent it.

383
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,606
- Maya!
- Stop.

384
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:11,833
Oh, my God!

385
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,429
Are you like so nervous?

386
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,185
- I mean... a little.
- Yeah?

387
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:22,479
Yeah.

388
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:24,692
It's like I know he's the one, you know.

389
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:26,320
Who are you guys talking about?

390
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:27,758
None of your freaking business, Jafeer.

391
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,328
Yeah, it's none of your freaking business.

392
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:32,499
If you really want to know...

393
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,294
I've met someone.

394
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:37,342
Or I'm about to meet him after school.

395
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:39,847
Wait, you haven't met him in person yet?

396
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:43,062
- That's shady.
- Oh, no, we've talked on AIM like a lot.

397
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:46,736
He's probably some wart-y old dude,
who has a beer belly

398
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,782
or suit socks and lives with his mother.

399
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:52,623
Or he's a computer genius
with a tight bod, Jafeer.

400
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:55,306
- Like you wouldn't even...
- Can we just change the conversation?

401
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:57,423
- What?
- Start a new one.

402
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,261
We weren't even talking to you.

403
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:01,181
It's just kinda lame.

404
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:03,979
- OK, well...
- OK, well, stop... like, don't listen.

405
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:06,526
- Anyway, Mai?
- What?

406
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:09,281
I'm like, so excited for you, honestly.

407
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:11,034
- I really, really am.
- Yeah, yeah.

408
00:22:11,118 --> 00:22:13,289
- I just wanna ask one quick question.
- OK, what?

409
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:14,810
Are you sure that you want to meet him,

410
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,713
because what if he's pissed
that you're a kid.

411
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,182
I don't think that's a possibility,
like, I don't.

412
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:24,144
- OK.
- I'm not gonna stand him up.

413
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:25,479
I couldn't do that to him...

414
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:28,068
- Right. OK.
- You know. Yeah.

415
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,158
- I just feel like we need back up.
- Yeah.

416
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:33,955
- Yeah.
- Like someone that can protect us.

417
00:22:34,582 --> 00:22:35,751
We should ask Brendan.

418
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:46,898
'Sup, B?

419
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:48,482
Spencer.

420
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,146
You're OK, Maya? Can I get you some water?

421
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,214
I'm good.

422
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:01,468
I'm good. Don't leave.

423
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:07,146
What if he gets mad when he sees me
that I don't look like what I said I look?

424
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,025
Maya, you're fine.

425
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,488
You're fine as hell. You're finer
than you even described.

426
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:12,574
Yeah.

427
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,246
And maybe he doesn't look like
how he described himself.

428
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:17,125
I mean, he could really be
anybody in here.

429
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:19,586
Yeah.

- Yeah, yeah.

455
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:50,854
I think it's getting dark.

456
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,860
We should just get home soon
before it gets too late.

457
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:55,237
Do you think he...

458
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:59,037
Do you think that he came and saw me
and thought I was ugly and left?

459
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:02,503
Well, if he did that, then he's an idiot.

460
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:08,138
Yeah, or I'm like an idiot
for thinking he would like me.

461
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,228
- Mai.
- No, no, I'm fine.

462
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:14,359
Here, go get yourself a Mountain Dew.

463
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,112
Thanks.

464
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:25,172
Thanks for coming with us.

465
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:26,634
Sure.

466
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:34,900
Oh, what are you doing?

467
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:36,779
I can't... I can't...

468
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:37,862
What...

469
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:42,415
They don't have any Mountain Dews left.
Can we go?

470
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:43,626
Please?

471
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,337
- Mm-hmm.
- Like now?

472
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:46,421
OK.
