WEBVTT

00:52.036 --> 00:53.501
<i>Welcome!</i>

01:12.033 --> 01:14.246
- OK, so screen names...
- OK.

01:14.271 --> 01:16.610
So I have three options here for me...

01:16.918 --> 01:19.841
Stardust4eva, Sclub7...

01:19.966 --> 01:22.262
- which might be taken already...
- Mm-hmm.

01:22.345 --> 01:24.099
...and Babyspice666.

01:24.183 --> 01:26.145
Isn't 666 like the Devil's number?

01:26.980 --> 01:27.899
No.

01:28.859 --> 01:32.199
Six is my favorite number
and my lucky number, so...

01:35.246 --> 01:36.373
Oh, my God!

01:38.629 --> 01:40.048
- Good job.
- I got mine.

01:43.095 --> 01:44.682
OK, cool, my turn.

01:45.475 --> 01:47.647
What do you mean?
I just signed on to mine.

01:47.730 --> 01:49.943
You got a screen name. Now it's my turn.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.445
But I haven't added any "Buddies".

01:51.529 --> 01:52.949
You, like, don't need to.

01:53.032 --> 01:55.955
You just have one buddy.
Your boyfriend buddy.

01:56.623 --> 01:58.292
Maya, that's not even funny.

01:58.376 --> 01:59.629
Like, we're barely boyfriend-girlfriend.

01:59.712 --> 02:00.631
Yeah, right.

02:00.714 --> 02:03.637
"Hi, Brendan. It's Anna.
I'm hogging the computer.

02:03.720 --> 02:04.681
I love you."

02:07.477 --> 02:09.774
Who's "hockey00?"

02:09.857 --> 02:11.485
It's Alex.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.383
Stop.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.241
So funny.

03:03.996 --> 03:05.582
My God!

03:06.053 --> 03:07.222
It's messed up.

03:07.305 --> 03:08.516
He probably got knocked off.

03:08.599 --> 03:10.269
- That's shady.
- That happens.

03:10.353 --> 03:11.856
That's not cool.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.027
- OK, let's talk to Sam.
- OK, fine.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.405
What's his screen name?

03:15.488 --> 03:16.407
OK.

03:16.490 --> 03:20.833
It is "LittlemanbigD1814"

03:21.333 --> 03:23.004
"Little man big D?"

03:23.964 --> 03:25.591
Ew!

03:29.141 --> 03:30.978
He's so nasty.

03:31.270 --> 03:32.857
It's funny, though.

03:32.940 --> 03:34.359
Type it in.

03:34.443 --> 03:36.740
Hey, hun. It's Anna.

03:37.365 --> 03:39.119
No, and me. Say, "Me, too."

03:39.202 --> 03:42.250
- Maya.
- Say, "Me" ah... "and Maya."

03:42.375 --> 03:43.335
OK.

03:51.644 --> 03:52.897
OK, he wants to know my screen name.

03:52.980 --> 03:54.274
I want to type.

03:54.357 --> 03:57.363
Don't have one yet. Dash from Maya.

04:02.207 --> 04:05.254
<i>Tell me when you do.
Dash from Sam. TTYL.</i>

04:07.300 --> 04:10.724
Oh, my God. Who's "Dogwigs2332?"

04:11.810 --> 04:13.187
Oh, my God, Brendan's online.

04:14.272 --> 04:15.525
Oh, my God!

04:18.907 --> 04:22.247
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. Should I respond?

04:22.330 --> 04:24.752
Like, what if Alex comes back on,
and I'm distracted.

04:24.836 --> 04:27.758
Yeah, but he's like your boyfriend,
so you have to respond.

04:31.683 --> 04:34.104
<i>Yeah, I know. WUWU?</i>

04:37.653 --> 04:38.989
"WUWU"?

04:39.991 --> 04:41.535
What the fuck is WUWU?

04:44.416 --> 04:46.921
Oh, my God.
He doesn't even know what WUWU means?

04:47.005 --> 04:49.050
I don't know what it means.
What does it mean?

04:49.134 --> 04:51.346
What's up with you.

04:51.430 --> 04:53.100
WUWU.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.981
<i>I can't believe
you don't know what that means.</i>

04:56.148 --> 04:57.233
<i>Smiley face.</i>

04:57.860 --> 04:59.446
OK, it's my turn.

04:59.822 --> 05:01.743
Maya, Brendan just IM'd me.

05:01.826 --> 05:03.037
No, let me set up my screen name.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.790
- Maya, we're talking.
- Give it.

05:04.874 --> 05:08.255
Stop! It's my turn!

05:08.339 --> 05:10.426
Please, don't break my keyboard.
Don't break my keyboard.

05:10.509 --> 05:15.061
Give it to me! Thank you. Finally, like...

05:15.144 --> 05:16.689
I just... OK, let me say good-bye.

05:16.773 --> 05:19.569
OK, say good-bye and then bye-bye forever.

05:24.872 --> 05:28.462
OK, screen name. So I'm gonna be...

05:29.799 --> 05:31.719
Viper911.

05:33.472 --> 05:36.103
- My God! What the eff! It's taken.
- I'm sorry, hun.

05:36.186 --> 05:38.858
- But look, AIM gives other options.
- Oh, yeah.

05:38.942 --> 05:41.196
Let me see.

05:41.781 --> 05:43.117
I'm just gonna do this one.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.787
- The "D" one?
- Yeah.

05:44.870 --> 05:47.041
It's Viper with a "D" 911.

05:48.210 --> 05:49.964
Diaper emergency!

05:51.926 --> 05:53.345
Think about it.

05:53.930 --> 05:56.101
I think it's, like, cool.

06:07.206 --> 06:09.628
<i>Waz up dingleberry?</i>

06:13.260 --> 06:17.018
<i>Oh, my God!
Your screen name what the eff!</i>

06:17.560 --> 06:20.650
Can I just check to see
if Brendan's still online?

06:20.734 --> 06:24.366
Anna, like, you were just talking to him.
You don't even like him that much.

06:26.536 --> 06:27.998
There he is.

06:28.082 --> 06:30.127
What's that thing next to his name?

06:32.716 --> 06:33.927
- It's weird.
- Oh, wait.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.806
He has a quote. It's like...

06:42.568 --> 06:43.988
Wait. That's about you.

06:44.072 --> 06:45.617
What do you mean?

06:46.076 --> 06:48.080
He's, like, obsessed with you.

06:48.163 --> 06:49.582
He wants to hug you.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.586
It's just an away message, Maya.

06:51.671 --> 06:53.549
OK, I wanna see who else is on.

06:55.344 --> 06:57.390
What the eff? Everyone's signing off.

06:58.475 --> 07:00.312
Have you ever been in a chatroom?

07:04.195 --> 07:06.449
OK, what's that one? M4m.

07:06.533 --> 07:08.036
Holy eff. No way, Maya!

07:08.120 --> 07:09.330
- What?
- Local one.

07:09.414 --> 07:11.084
"Hot people of Franklin County."

07:11.585 --> 07:13.255
Wait. Should we go in there?

07:14.007 --> 07:16.637
- Are we allowed?
- We're hot. We're in Franklin.

07:18.599 --> 07:22.398
OK, yeah, I guess they can't see
if we're hot or not, so just... do it.

07:22.481 --> 07:23.400
Do it.

07:23.483 --> 07:25.279
- Oh, my God.
- Uh, like, 16 people.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.408
Oh, my God.
This is so crazy.

07:27.491 --> 07:28.828
Say something.

07:28.912 --> 07:29.872
What do I say?

07:30.456 --> 07:32.460
- You do it.
- No, you do it.

07:32.543 --> 07:33.922
You do it.

07:34.757 --> 07:36.092
OK, fine.

07:36.636 --> 07:37.930
What do I say?

07:38.013 --> 07:42.063
OK. 'Sup hotties?

07:42.689 --> 07:45.987
I'm hot girl.

07:46.071 --> 07:47.323
Maya!

07:47.908 --> 07:49.535
Oh, my God.

07:50.454 --> 07:52.375
Wait. It's, like, going so fast,

07:52.458 --> 07:54.212
you know, it, like, gets lost.

07:54.295 --> 07:55.966
OK, Maya, "PhuckMaStick" just said "asl".

07:56.591 --> 07:57.970
What does "asl" stand for?

08:02.520 --> 08:04.650
Oh, my God. Can he see?

08:05.317 --> 08:07.906
Of course not.
My dad doesn't have a webcam.

08:08.073 --> 08:11.246
- Accept or decline?
- You do it. You do it.

08:11.914 --> 08:13.125
- Cool.
- Accept.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.127
OK.

08:15.630 --> 08:18.302
'Sup, baby.
How hot are you? Show me!

08:21.057 --> 08:22.560
- My God!
- Oh, my God!

08:22.644 --> 08:24.439
- Oh, my God, Maya.
- Oh, my God, 'Na, stop!

08:24.522 --> 08:25.859
- You're freaking me out.
- You're freaking me out.

08:25.942 --> 08:26.861
Stop!

08:26.944 --> 08:29.532
Hey, I need to use the phone right now...

08:29.616 --> 08:31.119
...so IM time is over.

08:31.286 --> 08:32.956
Got it.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.502
Like, now.

08:35.586 --> 08:37.131
- OK.
- OK.

08:37.465 --> 08:38.508
Look out.

08:39.636 --> 08:40.638
<i>Good-bye.</i>

08:42.224 --> 08:44.479
Listen, Sam,
it was, like, so messed up.

08:44.562 --> 08:46.316
It was crazy, crazy-crazy.

08:46.399 --> 08:48.111
Wait. You talked to some guy in town?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.992
Well, he can't find you
unless you've told him where you live.

08:51.117 --> 08:54.499
Are you say... We were in a room
for Franklin County for hot people,

08:54.582 --> 08:56.336
like, that's what we were in.

08:56.419 --> 08:58.048
<i>He doesn't know your name.
Does he?</i>

08:58.758 --> 09:01.304
Sam, you're scaring us. Why?

09:01.388 --> 09:04.185
Sam, stop. No.
He just knows our screen names, like...

09:04.268 --> 09:06.147
You're fine, Diper911.

09:06.231 --> 09:07.943
It's just for guys who wanna hook up.

09:09.529 --> 09:11.992
All right. I'm gonna hang up now.
Later, losers.

09:12.076 --> 09:13.537
Bye.

09:15.499 --> 09:17.128
Oh, my God.

09:17.211 --> 09:19.382
Stop. It's my mom. It's my mom.

09:19.465 --> 09:21.469
Jesus!

09:21.553 --> 09:23.432
- Love you.
- Love you, Anna.

09:24.308 --> 09:25.603
Maya.

09:42.595 --> 09:45.434
No. Frickin' like, "Do your homework."

09:47.313 --> 09:50.277
Sponges and sea stars,
like, it's not that hard.

10:22.007 --> 10:23.343
- Maya?
- <i>Welcome!</i>

10:23.510 --> 10:25.180
Are you done with your homework?

10:25.264 --> 10:27.602
<i>- You've got mail.</i>
- Yeah. I'm doing it.

10:27.686 --> 10:29.564
Like, I need the computer

10:29.648 --> 10:31.484
for a research project, so...

10:31.735 --> 10:33.154
Research project?

10:33.238 --> 10:35.284
Yeah. It's due tomorrow.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.956
Tomorrow? Well, then hurry up
and finish it.

10:38.039 --> 10:42.256
Duh! It's literally what I'm doing,
so can you leave me alone, please?

10:42.924 --> 10:44.176
OK.

11:03.340 --> 11:06.596
So... I heard something today

11:06.680 --> 11:10.897
while I was, um,
driving Anna and Maya home.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.651
They were whispering, but...

11:14.195 --> 11:15.113
What?

11:15.489 --> 11:17.242
You have a boyfriend.

11:18.453 --> 11:21.125
- What?
- Mom, what, you spying on us?

11:21.209 --> 11:23.756
Who? Someone we know?

11:23.839 --> 11:25.092
Brandon.

11:25.175 --> 11:27.847
Mom, it's Brendan. It's not Brandon.

11:28.473 --> 11:29.685
You're not even a good spy,

11:29.810 --> 11:31.939
and we're just taking it
really, really slow.

11:32.022 --> 11:33.776
We just barely started going out.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.945
Is he a catch?

11:35.989 --> 11:38.326
Because you are catch. Kinda major catch.

11:38.869 --> 11:44.296
Curtis, is this from Wok N' Roll
or Shanghai?

11:44.380 --> 11:47.971
Because Wok N' Roll is the one
that made me sick

11:48.054 --> 11:49.473
after your mole removal.

11:50.350 --> 11:51.770
I thought that was Shanghai, so...

11:51.812 --> 11:53.816
OK, so this is Wok N' Roll.

11:53.899 --> 11:57.072
Seriously I reminded you this morning
before you left.

11:57.156 --> 11:58.743
<i>Now again you made me...</i>

11:58.826 --> 11:59.953
<i>It's Chinese food.</i>

12:00.037 --> 12:01.289
<i>No, it's not Chinese food.</i>

12:01.372 --> 12:02.751
<i>That one place makes me sick,</i>

12:02.834 --> 12:04.253
<i>and the other place doesn't.</i>

12:20.745 --> 12:23.333
I'm calling Anna for homework help.

12:27.851 --> 12:28.855
OK.

12:37.695 --> 12:39.448
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Oh, my God, 'Na!

12:39.532 --> 12:41.620
I'm back
in "Hot people of Franklin County."

12:41.703 --> 12:43.916
Oh, my God, you're back in?

12:43.999 --> 12:45.670
<i>There's like 19 people in here.</i>

12:45.753 --> 12:46.797
What are they saying?

12:46.880 --> 12:50.137
They're saying so many things,
like, "discrete?"

12:50.721 --> 12:52.851
"Purple pussy cat."

12:52.934 --> 12:55.564
- "Looking to play."
- <i>You love playing.</i>

12:56.692 --> 12:57.944
Oh, my God, some random guy
just IM'd me again.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.865
- 'Na...
- <i>Oh, my God, Maya, be careful.</i>

12:59.948 --> 13:01.367
<i>Remember last time.</i>

13:01.450 --> 13:03.496
Flymiamibro22.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.043
- <i>That's a hot screen name.</i>
- Yeah.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.716
OK, I'm clicking on it.

13:08.841 --> 13:12.055
He says, "Hey, hottie. Zup.
What you look like?"

13:12.139 --> 13:15.312
Oh, my God, 'Na, he thinks I'm hot,
and he's saying hi. Help me.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.399
- What do I say back?
- <i>Well, he can't find our age.</i>

13:17.482 --> 13:18.611
Yeah, obviously.

13:18.694 --> 13:20.488
OK, let's just say we're like...

13:21.658 --> 13:23.578
Well, um...

13:24.246 --> 13:27.211
We are both 13, so, like, 13 plus 13,
that's like 26.

13:27.294 --> 13:29.256
I'm just gonna say we're 26.

13:29.340 --> 13:30.927
<i>Say we have blonde hair
and brown eyes,</i>

13:31.010 --> 13:33.264
<i>- like, if we were one person.</i>
- OK. I love that.

13:33.348 --> 13:36.939
Blonde hair. Brown eyes.

13:41.030 --> 13:42.742
Oh, my God, he thinks we're hot.

13:43.994 --> 13:45.121
OK, wait.

13:45.205 --> 13:49.171
He's 30. He's a computer programmer
and a total gym rat.

13:49.254 --> 13:52.929
Oh, my God, he's a freaking gym rat.
That's like...

13:53.388 --> 13:55.100
what is that?

13:55.433 --> 13:58.314
OK. Are you hot?

13:58.398 --> 14:00.318
<i>Um, it's a chatroom
for hot people.</i>

14:00.402 --> 14:01.613
<i>- Remember?</i>
- Shh!

14:03.282 --> 14:04.326
Oh, my God, he says,

14:04.410 --> 14:06.247
"People tell me I'm hot but I am humble.

14:06.330 --> 14:07.792
It's not for me to say."

14:07.875 --> 14:09.003
That means he's hot.

14:09.086 --> 14:10.715
Wait, that's what people say that are hot.

14:10.798 --> 14:11.675
<i>I know.</i>

14:11.758 --> 14:14.681
I'm, like, into this guy.

14:14.764 --> 14:17.144
Oh, Maya, can you hold on?
I just have call waiting.

14:17.227 --> 14:18.438
OK.

14:20.358 --> 14:21.527
Hello?

14:21.611 --> 14:23.573
<i>Hi. Can I please
speak to Anna please?</i>

14:23.657 --> 14:25.452
<i>This is Brendan Tooler speaking.</i>

14:26.078 --> 14:27.497
Hi. It's Anna.

14:27.832 --> 14:28.917
<i>Uh, hi.</i>

14:29.627 --> 14:31.965
What's up? You called...

14:32.049 --> 14:33.301
<i>Yeah, is that cool?</i>

14:34.428 --> 14:36.892
Yeah, I just... I'm talking to
Maya on the other line

14:36.975 --> 14:38.854
so I'm just gonna have to...

14:38.937 --> 14:41.735
um, tell her that I'll call her back,
I guess.

14:41.818 --> 14:43.071
<i>Oh. OK, sure.</i>

14:43.362 --> 14:44.573
OK, hold on.

14:46.118 --> 14:47.454
- Maya?
- <i>What?</i>

14:47.537 --> 14:49.041
Oh, my God, Brendan just called me.

14:49.124 --> 14:50.878
- <i>Wait. Really?</i>
- Like...

14:50.961 --> 14:52.130
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- ...are you kidding?

14:52.214 --> 14:53.842
<i>Anna, this is like real...</i>

14:53.926 --> 14:56.263
Um, can I call you back
and just talk to him for a minute, like...

14:56.347 --> 14:57.809
No. Go, go, go.

14:57.892 --> 14:59.938
I'm talking to Flymiami.

15:00.522 --> 15:01.858
<i>Well, you're still
chatting with him?</i>

15:01.942 --> 15:02.902
I know it's crazy.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.406
- <i>Progress check in the morning.</i>
- OK.

15:05.490 --> 15:07.035
- <i>OK. Be good over there, bye!</i>
- Bye.

15:14.801 --> 15:18.099
I like nature too.

15:18.934 --> 15:21.021
Sand dunes.

15:21.105 --> 15:23.652
Ha. JK.

15:25.113 --> 15:26.157
Mm.

15:27.284 --> 15:29.037
I shouldn't have said that.

15:37.930 --> 15:39.183
That's like...

16:25.525 --> 16:27.153
Flymiamibro?

16:27.947 --> 16:28.907
'Sup?

16:32.748 --> 16:34.543
<i>Yo, girl,
you got an email address?</i>

16:34.627 --> 16:36.171
<i>Yeah, I'll give it to you, hottie.</i>

16:36.255 --> 16:37.758
- That's hot.
- You're hot.

16:37.842 --> 16:40.054
- You're so fricking hot.
- I've never felt this way before.

16:40.138 --> 16:41.850
- Me neither. My heart's gonna burst.
- Bang!

16:41.933 --> 16:43.854
- Am I dead?
- You could take it, bitch.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.023
Because I'm in heaven with you right now.

16:45.106 --> 16:46.651
- Bury me.
- When I think of other girls,

16:46.735 --> 16:47.737
I wanna barf my guts out.

16:47.820 --> 16:51.535
I wanna eat that barf and guts up
like a big, old bowl of lentil soup.

16:51.619 --> 16:52.913
Yum, yum, yum, yum...

16:52.997 --> 16:54.499
Sometimes there's so much beauty
in the world

16:54.583 --> 16:55.501
I feel like I can't take it.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.840
I love you more than I love my own dad.

16:57.965 --> 16:58.967
- Maya-chan!
- Aah!

16:59.051 --> 17:00.470
Why are you still up?

17:04.645 --> 17:06.733
I just finished the research project.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.906
- Go to bed.
- OK.

17:16.711 --> 17:18.422
I think I'm in love.

17:20.844 --> 17:22.222
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:22.305 --> 17:23.307
- Mai?
- Yeah.

17:23.391 --> 17:25.103
- That's a really big word.
- No, I know.

17:25.186 --> 17:27.482
And you just like, barely know him
is the only thing.

17:27.565 --> 17:29.737
No, I know, but, like,
sometimes you can just tell.

17:29.821 --> 17:32.117
- You haven't met him yet?
- It's from the way we're talking.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.119
Wassup, Maya?

17:34.204 --> 17:35.081
Hey.

17:35.456 --> 17:38.964
See. Even Evan's way less hot to me
since I met Flymiamibro.

17:39.047 --> 17:41.720
- That's how you know.
- Oh, my God. Don't look.

17:41.803 --> 17:43.389
Hey, Anna. Hey, Maya.

17:43.472 --> 17:44.642
- Hey, Brendan.
- Hey.

17:45.936 --> 17:47.188
I burned this for you.

17:51.656 --> 17:52.992
'Cause you said you love music.

17:55.496 --> 17:56.958
You don't have to listen to it.

17:58.002 --> 18:00.047
No, I do love music. Thank you.

18:01.049 --> 18:02.343
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:05.475 --> 18:08.522
Oh, my God,
he's, like, in love with you.

18:08.607 --> 18:10.234
- We talked for hours last night.
- Wait. Really?

18:10.318 --> 18:11.654
It's all moving too fast.

18:11.738 --> 18:13.950
No, I think it's moving exactly
the right speed.

18:14.034 --> 18:15.077
I do.

18:15.536 --> 18:16.998
Seventh grade rules.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.682
I can't believe he made me a mix CD.

18:25.766 --> 18:27.018
The song sucks.

18:28.103 --> 18:29.564
Play the next one.

18:33.113 --> 18:36.453
Oh, my God, he wants to slow-dance
with you...

18:36.537 --> 18:38.708
Maya, shut up!

19:20.291 --> 19:22.671
Anna, does your dad have a digital camera?

19:24.842 --> 19:25.761
Mm-hmm.

19:26.219 --> 19:29.309
You think we can take a picture of me
and send it to Flymiamibro.

19:30.144 --> 19:32.273
- No.
- Why?

19:32.357 --> 19:34.527
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No. Yes, it is.

19:34.612 --> 19:36.073
It's just not something
we should be doing.

19:36.156 --> 19:39.412
It's just like a picture of me
so he can know what I look like.

19:39.789 --> 19:42.043
- No. We are not doing it.
- No... Anna, yes.

19:42.126 --> 19:43.755
Maya, I'm putting my foot down.

19:43.838 --> 19:45.216
Absolutely not.

19:50.267 --> 19:51.311
That's hot.

19:51.395 --> 19:53.190
And make sure you're getting the boob too.

19:53.524 --> 19:54.777
Sure, do.

19:56.530 --> 19:57.908
OK, let me see it.

19:57.950 --> 19:59.108
Let me see.

20:00.329 --> 20:01.874
Oh, My God.

20:02.751 --> 20:05.047
That looks bad. That's blurry.

20:05.131 --> 20:07.678
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, wait, I like that one.

20:08.095 --> 20:09.514
That's good.

20:09.597 --> 20:11.560
Showing a lot. Um...

20:12.771 --> 20:14.149
How about just this one?

20:15.317 --> 20:17.530
That's literally just my hand.

20:17.614 --> 20:19.117
I know but it's beautiful.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.000
OK.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.379
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. I'm gonna send it.

20:27.592 --> 20:28.594
Oh, my God.

20:28.678 --> 20:30.932
Stop it! stop it!
Anna, Anna, stop.

20:31.016 --> 20:32.728
- What if he doesn't think it's pretty?
- I can't believe you just did that.

20:32.811 --> 20:34.607
What if he doesn't think it's pretty?

20:35.024 --> 20:36.611
Oh my God, he already responded.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.698
"So hot."

20:44.042 --> 20:46.421
OK, I'm sorry, we have to meet.

20:47.883 --> 20:49.135
- What?
- Ssh!

20:49.219 --> 20:51.766
I have to meet you...

20:51.849 --> 20:53.185
- Maya, don't send that.
- Stop.

20:53.268 --> 20:55.147
- ...in person.
- Maya, don't send that.

20:58.028 --> 21:00.032
- No. Don't send that.
- I sent it.

21:00.449 --> 21:01.493
I sent it.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.706
- Maya!
- Stop.

21:11.388 --> 21:12.933
Oh, my God!

21:17.901 --> 21:19.529
Are you like so nervous?

21:20.030 --> 21:22.285
- I mean... a little.
- Yeah?

21:22.368 --> 21:23.579
Yeah.

21:23.663 --> 21:25.792
It's like I know he's the one, you know.

21:25.876 --> 21:27.420
Who are you guys talking about?

21:27.503 --> 21:28.798
None of your freaking business, Jafeer.

21:28.882 --> 21:31.428
Yeah, it's none of your freaking business.

21:31.846 --> 21:33.599
If you really want to know...

21:34.184 --> 21:35.394
I've met someone.

21:36.188 --> 21:38.442
Or I'm about to meet him after school.

21:38.525 --> 21:40.947
Wait, you haven't met him in person yet?

21:41.406 --> 21:44.162
- That's shady.
- Oh, no, we've talked on AIM like a lot.

21:44.245 --> 21:47.836
He's probably some wart-y old dude,
who has a beer belly

21:47.920 --> 21:49.882
or suit socks and lives with his mother.

21:49.965 --> 21:53.723
Or he's a computer genius
with a tight bod, Jafeer.

21:53.806 --> 21:56.353
- Like you wouldn't even...
- Can we just change the conversation?

21:56.771 --> 21:58.523
- What?
- Start a new one.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.361
We weren't even talking to you.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.281
It's just kinda lame.

22:02.365 --> 22:05.079
- OK, well...
- OK, well, stop... like, don't listen.

22:05.496 --> 22:07.626
- Anyway, Mai?
- What?

22:07.709 --> 22:10.381
I'm like, so excited for you, honestly.

22:10.506 --> 22:12.134
- I really, really am.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:12.218 --> 22:14.389
- I just wanna ask one quick question.
- OK, what?

22:14.472 --> 22:15.850
Are you sure that you want to meet him,

22:15.934 --> 22:17.813
because what if he's pissed
that you're a kid.

22:20.610 --> 22:23.282
I don't think that's a possibility,
like, I don't.

22:23.616 --> 22:25.244
- OK.
- I'm not gonna stand him up.

22:25.327 --> 22:26.579
I couldn't do that to him...

22:27.206 --> 22:29.168
- Right. OK.
- You know. Yeah.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.258
- I just feel like we need back up.
- Yeah.

22:32.466 --> 22:35.055
- Yeah.
- Like someone that can protect us.

22:35.682 --> 22:36.851
We should ask Brendan.

22:46.746 --> 22:47.998
'Sup, B?

22:48.582 --> 22:49.500
Spencer.

22:57.642 --> 22:59.187
You're OK, Maya? Can I get you some water?

22:59.270 --> 23:00.314
I'm good.

23:00.982 --> 23:02.568
I'm good. Don't leave.

23:04.656 --> 23:08.246
What if he gets mad when he sees me
that I don't look like what I said I look?

23:09.040 --> 23:10.125
Maya, you're fine.

23:10.209 --> 23:12.588
You're fine as hell. You're finer
than you even described.

23:12.672 --> 23:13.674
Yeah.

23:13.758 --> 23:16.346
And maybe he doesn't look like
how he described himself.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.225
I mean, he could really be
anybody in here.

23:19.686 --> 23:20.605
Yeah.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.577
Do you know what's crazy?

24:10.162 --> 24:13.502
I was just thinking that, like,
in three years, we'll be driving...

24:42.017 --> 24:44.105
Maybe his Ferrari broke down.

24:44.982 --> 24:48.154
- Hmm-mm, maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:50.158 --> 24:51.954
I think it's getting dark.

24:52.789 --> 24:54.960
We should just get home soon
before it gets too late.

24:55.043 --> 24:56.337
Do you think he...

24:56.588 --> 25:00.137
Do you think that he came and saw me
and thought I was ugly and left?

25:01.306 --> 25:03.603
Well, if he did that, then he's an idiot.

25:05.607 --> 25:09.238
Yeah, or I'm like an idiot
for thinking he would like me.

25:09.990 --> 25:12.328
- Mai.
- No, no, I'm fine.

25:12.787 --> 25:15.459
Here, go get yourself a Mountain Dew.

25:16.127 --> 25:17.212
Thanks.

25:24.645 --> 25:26.272
Thanks for coming with us.

25:26.356 --> 25:27.734
Sure.

25:34.831 --> 25:36.000
Oh, what are you doing?

25:36.084 --> 25:37.879
I can't... I can't...

25:37.962 --> 25:38.923
What...

25:40.968 --> 25:43.515
They don't have any Mountain Dews left.
Can we go?

25:43.598 --> 25:44.726
Please?

25:45.352 --> 25:46.437
- Mm-hmm.
- Like now?

25:46.521 --> 25:47.481
OK.

26:53.948 --> 26:55.408
<i>That means a lot to me.</i>

27:33.067 --> 27:34.111
<i>Welcome.</i>

27:34.821 --> 27:36.490
<i>You've got mail.</i>

27:46.302 --> 27:47.639
<i>Computer...</i>

27:49.141 --> 27:49.976
<i>Good-bye.</i>
