00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:12,024
Maya, Shuji, fax...

2
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,078
OK.

3
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:20,792
<i>Dear family...</i>

4
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:23,589
<i>arrived in Cleveland today.</i>

5
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:28,265
<i>The weather is cold,
but my drumsticks are on fire!</i>

6
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:29,808
<i>How are you all?</i>

7
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:33,191
<i>Miss you very much. Love, Dad.</i>

8
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:37,576
<i>Dear Dad, I miss you so much.</i>

9
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:40,205
<i>Yesterday I scored a goal at soccer.</i>

10
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,374
I wasn't ready.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,629
I was right there with you.

12
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,215
Get it, Alice.

13
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,305
<i>Dear Maya. I wish
I could've been there to see your goal.</i>

14
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:51,227
<i>I'm not surprised though,
I was quite the athlete myself.</i>

15
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:53,733
<i>Must be in the genes! How's Anna?</i>

16
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:55,528
<i>Are you making any new friends?</i>

17
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:58,199
<i>Dear Dad,
Anna's still my best friend,</i>

18
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:01,456
<i>but my impression of Jim Carey
is getting really good</i>

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,140
<i>and there are at least four popular kids
that want to be our bf's,</i>

20
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:05,590
<i>"Best friends" now.</i>

21
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:09,973
<i>I'm also starting to sleep
in my own bed more. Ask Mom.</i>

22
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,392
<i>Actually don't.</i>

23
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:15,860
<i>Dear Maya. That sounds nice.
I miss sleeping in the bed with your mom.</i>

24
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:19,785
<i>It's lonely out on the road sometimes.
We've all got our ways of dealing with it.</i>

25
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:22,749
<i>For me, it's reading your letters.</i>

26
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,293
<i>So, please keep sending!</i>

27
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:25,797

Alex broke up with Heather.

36
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,986
Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm.

37
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:20,990
Are you losing your mind?

38
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,455
- It's all happening.
- It's all happening.

39
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,459
This is the moment. Oh, my God.

40
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:35,310
All right, everybody,
take your seats, please.

41
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:40,738
- I have some very exciting news.
- Alex Nolan is single.

42
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:47,794
I mean, like, if you're a girl
that's more exciting

43
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:49,378
maybe.

44
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:53,556
Just like, you know
the whole school's been talking about it.

45
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:56,227
I'm not weird, you guys are weird.

46
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:58,354
OK.

47
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:02,615
This Friday is Trailview Middle's
"Night of Amazing Music"

48
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,665
which means the band and the chorus
will be performing for the whole school.

49
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:11,132
And what's more,
you all will be performing

50
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,598
an original piece of music,
written by yours truly.

51
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:16,643
You'll find the music on your stands.

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,816
Na, I only have three notes solo.
How many do you have?

53
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,945
I have, like a five-measure solo.

54
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:23,991
All right,
let's try the piece. Shall we?

55
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:26,454
One, two, three...

56
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:40,416
All right, hol...
Just hold it.

57
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,319
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.

58
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:45,408
Timpani. I... I don't know
what that is you're playing

59
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,162
but you should be playing

60
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:49,291
a straight 4/4 count in time.

61
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,047
Yeah, sorry.
Do you mean the snare 'cause I feel like

62
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,945
- Timpani was doing four, four.
- No, Timpani... No, the snare is fine...

63
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,307
Try to stay within the four, four times.

64
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:58,578
You want me to do it differently?

65
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:00,414
- 'Cause I was doing a four, four.
- So... No, right. Somewhere in there.

66
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:02,527
I'll tell you what. Play it like your dad.

67
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:05,031
Why don't we try it
from the top again.

68
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:09,331
Do you wanna watch me practice

69
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,335
for my chorus solo audition later?

70
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,924
I mean, I would,
but I have enough on my plate

71
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,927
with that three notes solo,
you know what I mean?

72
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:18,892
- But you're the best singer I know, so...
- Yeah.

73
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:22,357
Do you think Alex is gonna come
to the show later?

74
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:25,488
- Yeah, it's kind of... Oh, my God.
- Hey.

75
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,496
- Hey.
- I'm, uh, I'm Brendan.

76
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,046
- I'm Anna.
- I know who you are.

77
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:34,716
We're in band together.

78
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:37,638
I mean, anyone who does music
at Trailview knows you.

79
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:39,224
Really?

80
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,563
Are you excited
for the "Night of Amazing Music"?

81
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:42,815
Sure. I am, yeah.

82
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,611
- What... Are you Maya?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:46,782
I'm gonna get a new hat
after school for it.

84
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:50,246
- Are you allowed to do that?
- I'll do what I want.

85
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,457
OK.

86
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,171
Good.

87
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,806
Oh, my God!

88
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:12,625
- Where?
- Um...

89
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,589
After you've build the deck.

90
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:18,512
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

91
00:05:18,595 --> 00:05:20,014
- Why not?
- I don't know.

92
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:23,437
- What's the question?
- The question is...

93
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:26,862
- I forgot the question.
- The question is...

94
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:29,283
When you've build the deck.

95
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:32,915
- Question and the answer is...
- Pretty anemones.

Ah.

114
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:52,073
- Oh my God, Dad!
- What?

115
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,785
What?

116
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:56,081
I have one good eye left, OK?

117
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,044
I'll protect you from this one.

118
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:58,920
I don't think it's funny.

119
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,801
Look, mom, I am dad
and I'm 12 feet away from the flame.

120
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:04,640
That's not what I did.

121
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,079
- That is what you did. You're like...
- That's not what I did.

122
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:08,857
It's so far away.

123
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,276
- OK.
- That's immature.

124
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,780
Oh, you think so? Don't you dare.

125
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:14,619
How was school today, sweetheart?

126
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:18,375
Um, it was good,
like I have a music concert on Friday.

127
00:07:18,502 --> 00:07:20,379
And I have a solo in band

128
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:24,096
and I also have a chorus solo hopefully,
if it goes well...

129
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:25,641
Oh, that's great, no?

130
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,978
- That's amazing.
- I'm so proud. Yeah.

131
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:30,459
- Congratulations.
- I'm in. I'm totally in. You in, Kathy.

132
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,195
- Of course I'm in.
- Yeah. Good.

133
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:35,828
Afterwards we'll go for ice-cream
and we'll have an ice-cream cake.

134
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:37,621
Yeah.

Excellent.

All right, hold it.
Hold it, hold it.

141

Hold it, hold it.

What was that?

143
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,924
You're late.

144
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,154
- Let me see if we can work on this.
- OK.

145
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:27,657
I just wanna... I know...
I know you can get it.

146
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,035
- Yeah.
- All right. Yeah, but just from the top...

147
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,788
- Hmm-hmm.
- And that's the first two beats, OK?

148
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:33,168
- All right. OK.
- So count it out. One, two, three, four...

149
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:34,402
One, two, three...

150
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:37,743
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...

151
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,039
Here, here.

152
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,628
Am I early or late?

153
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:45,049
Early.

154
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:46,132
No.

155
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:47,385
Late.

156
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,349
No! Try it again. From the top, please.

157
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:51,162
- One... One, two, three, four...
- three, four...

158
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:53,567
No! Again! One, two, three, four...

159
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,280
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...

160
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:59,119
No, it's late, it's late, it's late.
Again, again, again!

161
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,419
Saved by the bell.

162
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:04,839
Miss Ishii-Peters.

163
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:07,551
You need to practice this
before tomorrow, please.

164
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:09,238
All right, everybody, let's pack it up.

165
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,186
You'll get it.

166
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,276
Can you help me after school?

167
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:18,157
I have chorus practice. I would, but...

168
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:21,789
- Or maybe Sam can help. Sam?
- No, don't ask him. Stop...

169
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,754
- Sorry, he's already here.
- Fuck you, Anna.

170
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:25,964
Can you help Maya?

171
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,302
Sure. I am the best drummer in the bands.

He kind of is, so...

173
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:33,270
OK, fine, can you just, like, help me
after 3:00, I don't really care.

174
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:35,817
- Yeah, I don't... I don't care either.
- I don't care either.

175
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:38,907
Let's just not care and just
don't be late, but, like, whatever.

176
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:42,246
- See you at 3:00.
- I'll see you at 3:00. Don't be late.

177
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,587
Wait, is that for me?

178
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:47,800
Hector.

179
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,806
Oh, my God!

180
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,352

181
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:55,774

00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,318
Oh, my God.

183
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:01,744
- Amazing!

00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:03,163
I don't know. Doi!

185
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,000
- I haven't read it yet. Doi.
- Uh! Doi.

186
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:10,428
We are going to look
at the microscope today.

187
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:13,142
We're gonna be very delicate.

188
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,394
Time to pair up.

189
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:19,362

um, your G.F. or whatever?

206
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:27,624
I broke up with her.
I don't have one anymore.

207
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,509
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

208

She was just, like, always there.

211
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:44,115
If I was your boyfriend,
I mean, girlfriend

212
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:45,827
I would not be anywhere,

213
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,956
unless you wanted me to be somewhere.

214
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,960
And then I'd be there on time.

215
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,631
Cool.

216
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:55,805

- Cool.

219
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:06,076
- And I'm in, like the band and chorus.
- Nice.

220
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:09,457
I barely have time for a boyfriend,
but I do have a little.

221
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,671
Are you gonna go, or...

222
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:15,219
Well, I... I think we have to go.

223
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,485
Like, hate that thing.

224
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:27,703
Let's focus on the basics, all right?

225
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:30,124
Let's start with your breath.

226
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,750
All right?

227
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:34,215
- Yeah.
- OK.

228
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:36,804
OK. So, close your eyes.

229

You guys have made my decision tough.

Anna, you will be singing the two-bar solo

But then I wonder if, like the...

272
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:39,711
Daddy!

273
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:42,007
Oh! Sweetheart! Oh!

- Hi, Daddy.

275
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:48,562
- Hey, Shuj.
- OK, Dad. Look at my new dance.

276
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:53,656
Welcome home.

277
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:56,787
- Dad, look.
- That's great.

278
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,375
Gigs went really, really great.

279
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,377
Oh, man!

280
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,799
So good to see you guys!

281
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:07,600
- Are you ready for the big day?
- Yeah.

282
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:10,105
- Yeah? Timpani.
- Yeah. I know.

283
00:16:10,397 --> 00:16:12,902
- You need some help rehearsing?
- I'm killing it.

284
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:15,115
- You are? I would love to see that.
- Yeah.

285
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,869
Can I see that?

286
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,765
- Can I help you? I kill that.
- No, Dad, I'm like...

287
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,041
I kill on Timpani.

289
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:24,718
Rehearsal, like do it
the solo in front of you?

290
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:25,801
Yeah.

291
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:29,393
OK. Hamper sounds good.

292
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:32,232
- Dad. Stop!
- OK.

293
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:33,903
So, start playing.

294
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:39,789
- OK, just don't say it like that.
- I... I didn't say it like anything.

295
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,728
Yes, you did.
Can you just shut up for a second,

296
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,230
'cause I was about to play
and you are messing me up.

297
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:44,254
Maya, just...

298
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:47,555
- Come on, calm down.
- I am calm, Dad.

299
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,686
I'm just trying to play for you,
so, can you, like, stop.

300
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:54,151
Don't look at me like that.
It's gonna mess me up.

301
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,030
Look away.

302
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:00,957
Don't look at the drum,
literally look at that wall over there,

303
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:02,959
and listen.

304
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,800
Dad! OK.

305
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:11,269
All right, all right,
I... I got to stop you.

306
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,439
- Oh, my God!
- You are holding the mallets wrong.

307
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:15,364
- You know, let me show you.
- Dad, this is why

308
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,173
- I didn't want to do this with you.
- If you can't play for me

309
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:18,969
- how you're gonna play for everyone else.
- I don't know

310
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:23,001
because not everyone's in, like,
a professional Steely Dan Cover Band, Dad!

311
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,840
And they never will be
if they don't know how to practice!

312
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,927
Oh, no!

313
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:31,183
Now, I'm gonna suck
tomorrow night 'cause of you.

314
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:32,687
Oh, fine. It's all because of me.

315
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:36,695
- Get out!
- Fine. I... I looked at your wrong.

316
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:37,905
Yeah, you did.

317
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:46,757
You know, Anna goes first today.

318
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:55,190
Hi, Ma. I got you some ginger ale
to settle your tum.

319
00:17:57,612 --> 00:17:58,965
What are you doing?
You shouldn't look at the crowd.

320
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:00,343
It's just gonna make you more nervous.

321
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:01,367
You're right.

322
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:03,498

Oh, my God.
That is so embarrassing.

Alex. Six o'clock.

326
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:16,817
Oh, no, I don't know
what o'clock is. He's right there.

327
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,735
Oh, where?

328
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:20,115
- He has a rose.
- Oh, my God!

329
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,954
- He came.
- I'm getting nervous actually.

- You really act it out.

343
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,492
Thanks.

344
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:22,393
Ladies and gentlemen,

345
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,660
you're in for a special treat
this evening.

346
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:27,531
The band has been
hard at work on an original song

347
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:29,409
composed by me.

348
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:11,118
Just breathe.

349
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:54,037
One. two...

350
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,266
Go.

351
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:32,322
Great job.

352
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,710
- Don't read it now.
- What?

353
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,300
Hey, honey.

354
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Hey, Dad.

355
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:45,640
You were great.

356
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:47,268
- Oh, thanks.
- Really great.

357
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:49,940
- It was fine. No.
- So proud. Yeah.

358
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:52,320
- Thanks.
- Your Mom had to leave early.

359
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:55,284
Yeah, I know. I saw.
But I don't care. Is she OK?

360
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:56,829
Yeah, she's fine. You know her.

361
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:58,708
She was in, uh, a mood.

362
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:00,668
Yeah.

363
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:03,423
Dang it.

364
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,722
I forgot to buy you flowers.

365
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:07,952
- Dad, stop, it's fine.
- I mean, look at that nice young man.

366
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:09,437
He's got flowers.

Here. Five, six, seven... Seven...

Seven dollars. There.

373
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:32,943

- OK, OK.

374
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:35,197
Um, you're gonna ruin my shirt, Sweety.

375
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:36,993
- OK. You know what?
- OK.

376
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:38,452
You were great.

377
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,219
Maya?

378
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:51,229
Can I... can I come back?

379
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:53,568
How are you? You OK?

380
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:56,156
Did you like my solo?

381
00:24:56,448 --> 00:24:59,078
Did I like it? I... I will never forget it.

382
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:01,751
- So, it wasn't amazing?
- It was.

383
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:06,092
I... I don't think it fit with the...
with the rest of the show, but...

384
00:25:06,886 --> 00:25:08,430
- Uh...
- Thanks.

385
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,519
It was amazing.

386
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:17,658
You know I only made up that solo
to impress you, right?

387
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:21,039
That I was only supposed to play
three notes.

388
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:30,015
You... you don't have to come up
with some fancy solo to impress me.

389
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,311
In music

390
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:37,280
every single note is important.
I would be proud of you

391
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:39,325
with just playing those three notes.

392
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,079
Are we OK?

393
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,624
Yeah.

394
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,924
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey. Uh...

395
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,678
No, no, it's OK. It's all right.

396
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,686
Um, you know what?
Um, we'll see you outside.

397
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:55,369
- Yeah, OK, we'll see you outside.
- OK, OK, all right. All right.

398
00:25:57,486 --> 00:25:59,032
So what? Are you like...

399
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:00,952
Are you gonna make fun of me?

400
00:26:01,954 --> 00:26:03,541
Probably at some point but not tonight.

401
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:06,839
Where did that come from?

402
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,676
I don't know, like...

403
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:11,014
You really like <i>The Exorcist.</i>

404
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,815
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

405
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,489
- How was I?
- Oh, my God. That was crazy.

406
00:26:20,575 --> 00:26:22,495
- Oh, did you find Alex?
- Hmm-hmm.

407
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,587
- And?
- Can't really talk about it.

408
00:26:28,215 --> 00:26:29,342
Oh!

409
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,304
Sometimes love means...

410
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:33,601
um, ignoring someone for years.

411
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:36,356
- That's a 100% true.
- Yeah.

412
00:26:36,816 --> 00:26:39,195
Um, can you look at this for me?

413
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:40,489
What is it?

414
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,953
- Nothing, it's...
- Back off.

415
00:26:47,963 --> 00:26:49,675
He did it a little bigger this time.

416
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,973
I guess he like loves me or whatever.

417
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:55,018
What are you gonna say?

418
00:26:56,522 --> 00:26:57,983
Which one should I say?

419
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:17,856
- I have a boyfriend! We do!
- We have a boyfriend!

420
