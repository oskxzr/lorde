00:09.191 --> 00:13.074
Maya, Shuji, fax...

00:18.001 --> 00:19.128
OK.

00:20.463 --> 00:21.842
<i>Dear family...</i>

00:23.177 --> 00:24.639
<i>...arrived in Cleveland today.</i>

00:25.473 --> 00:29.315
<i>The weather is cold,
but my drumsticks are on fire!</i>

00:29.858 --> 00:30.776
<i>How are you all?</i>

00:31.695 --> 00:34.241
<i>Miss you very much. Love, Dad.</i>

00:36.162 --> 00:38.626
<i>Dear Dad, I miss you so much.</i>

00:39.043 --> 00:41.255
<i>Yesterday I scored a goal at soccer.</i>

00:41.339 --> 00:42.424
I wasn't ready.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.679
I was right there with you.

00:45.221 --> 00:46.265
Get it, Alice.

00:46.349 --> 00:49.355
<i>Dear Maya. I wish
I could've been there to see your goal.</i>

00:49.438 --> 00:52.277
<i>I'm not surprised though,
I was quite the athlete myself.</i>

00:52.486 --> 00:54.783
<i>Must be in the genes! How's Anna?</i>

00:55.033 --> 00:56.578
<i>Are you making any new friends?</i>

00:56.912 --> 00:59.249
<i>Dear Dad,
Anna's still my best friend,</i>

00:59.333 --> 01:02.506
<i>but my impression of Jim Carey
is getting really good</i>

01:02.590 --> 01:05.053
<i>and there are at least four popular kids
that want to be our bf's,</i>

01:05.428 --> 01:06.640
<i>"Best friends" now.</i>

01:07.892 --> 01:11.023
<i>I'm also starting to sleep
in my own bed more. Ask Mom.</i>

01:11.440 --> 01:12.442
<i>Actually don't.</i>

01:12.902 --> 01:16.910
<i>Dear Maya. That sounds nice.
I miss sleeping in the bed with your mom.</i>

01:17.077 --> 01:20.835
<i>It's lonely out on the road sometimes.
We've all got our ways of dealing with it.</i>

01:21.377 --> 01:23.799
<i>For me, it's reading your letters.</i>

01:24.049 --> 01:25.343
<i>So, please keep sending!</i>

01:25.803 --> 01:26.847
<i>Love, Dad.</i>

02:11.978 --> 02:12.897
What?

02:16.195 --> 02:17.531
Alex broke up with Heather.

02:18.449 --> 02:20.036
Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm.

02:20.579 --> 02:22.040
Are you losing your mind?

02:23.669 --> 02:25.505
- It's all happening.
- It's all happening.

02:25.589 --> 02:27.509
This is the moment. Oh, my God.

02:34.106 --> 02:36.360
All right, everybody,
take your seats, please.

02:38.824 --> 02:41.788
- I have some very exciting news.
- Alex Nolan is single.

02:44.961 --> 02:48.844
I mean, like, if you're a girl
that's more exciting

02:49.428 --> 02:50.263
maybe.

02:51.015 --> 02:54.606
Just like, you know
the whole school's been talking about it.

02:54.939 --> 02:57.277
I'm not weird, you guys are weird.

02:58.404 --> 02:59.281
OK.

03:00.116 --> 03:03.665
This Friday is Trailview Middle's
"Night of Amazing Music"

03:03.749 --> 03:07.715
which means the band and the chorus
will be performing for the whole school.

03:09.552 --> 03:12.182
And what's more,
you all will be performing

03:12.558 --> 03:15.648
an original piece of music,
written by yours truly.

03:16.106 --> 03:17.693
You'll find the music on your stands.

03:18.570 --> 03:20.866
Na, I only have three notes solo.
How many do you have?

03:20.950 --> 03:22.995
I have, like a five-measure solo.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.041
All right,
let's try the piece. Shall we?

03:25.458 --> 03:27.504
One, two, three...

03:40.321 --> 03:41.407
All right, hol...
Just hold it.

03:41.490 --> 03:43.369
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.

03:43.536 --> 03:46.458
Timpani. I... I don't know
what that is you're playing

03:46.542 --> 03:48.212
but you should be playing

03:48.504 --> 03:50.341
a straight 4/4 count in time.

03:50.425 --> 03:53.097
Yeah, sorry.
Do you mean the snare 'cause I feel like

03:53.180 --> 03:55.936
- Timpani was doing four, four.
- No, Timpani... No, the snare is fine...

03:56.019 --> 03:58.357
Try to stay within the four, four times.

03:58.441 --> 03:59.569
You want me to do it differently?

03:59.652 --> 04:01.405
- 'Cause I was doing a four, four.
- So... No, right. Somewhere in there.

04:01.488 --> 04:03.577
I'll tell you what. Play it like your dad.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.081
Why don't we try it
from the top again.

04:08.628 --> 04:10.381
Do you wanna watch me practice

04:10.465 --> 04:12.385
for my chorus solo audition later?

04:12.469 --> 04:14.974
I mean, I would,
but I have enough on my plate

04:15.057 --> 04:16.853
with that three notes solo,
you know what I mean?

04:17.145 --> 04:19.942
- But you're the best singer I know, so...
- Yeah.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.407
Do you think Alex is gonna come
to the show later?

04:23.491 --> 04:26.538
- Yeah, it's kind of... Oh, my God.
- Hey.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.546
- Hey.
- I'm, uh, I'm Brendan.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.096
- I'm Anna.
- I know who you are.

04:34.722 --> 04:35.766
We're in band together.

04:35.849 --> 04:38.688
I mean, anyone who does music
at Trailview knows you.

04:39.397 --> 04:40.274
Really?

04:40.399 --> 04:42.613
Are you excited
for the "Night of Amazing Music"?

04:42.696 --> 04:43.865
Sure. I am, yeah.

04:43.949 --> 04:45.661
- What... Are you Maya?
- Yeah.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.832
I'm gonna get a new hat
after school for it.

04:48.959 --> 04:51.296
- Are you allowed to do that?
- I'll do what I want.

04:52.507 --> 04:53.342
OK.

04:55.221 --> 04:56.098
Good.

04:57.517 --> 04:59.856
Oh, my God!

05:12.255 --> 05:13.675
- Where?
- Um...

05:13.758 --> 05:16.639
After you've build the deck.

05:17.641 --> 05:19.562
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:19.645 --> 05:21.064
- Why not?
- I don't know.

05:21.231 --> 05:24.487
- What's the question?
- The question is...

05:25.198 --> 05:27.912
- I forgot the question.
- The question is...

05:28.747 --> 05:30.333
When you've build the deck.

05:31.043 --> 05:33.965
- Question and the answer is...
- Pretty anemones.

<i>Dear Dad,</i>

06:39.220 --> 06:42.352
<i>Like daughter like father! Meow, Maya.</i>

06:42.686 --> 06:44.732
Mom, help me with the fax.

06:46.861 --> 06:47.905
Mom!

06:49.825 --> 06:50.660
Ah.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.123
- Oh my God, Dad!
- What?

06:53.207 --> 06:54.835
What?

06:55.336 --> 06:57.131
I have one good eye left, OK?

06:57.215 --> 06:59.094
I'll protect you from this one.

06:59.177 --> 06:59.970
I don't think it's funny.

07:00.054 --> 07:02.851
Look, mom, I am dad
and I'm 12 feet away from the flame.

07:04.814 --> 07:05.690
That's not what I did.

07:05.774 --> 07:07.318
- That is what you did. You're like...
- That's not what I did.

07:08.153 --> 07:09.907
It's so far away.

07:09.990 --> 07:11.326
- OK.
- That's immature.

07:11.409 --> 07:12.830
Oh, you think so? Don't you dare.

07:12.913 --> 07:15.669
How was school today, sweetheart?

07:16.211 --> 07:19.425
Um, it was good,
like I have a music concert on Friday.

07:19.552 --> 07:21.429
And I have a solo in band

07:21.513 --> 07:25.146
and I also have a chorus solo hopefully,
if it goes well...

07:25.229 --> 07:26.691
Oh, that's great, no?

07:26.774 --> 07:29.028
- That's amazing.
- I'm so proud. Yeah.

07:29.404 --> 07:31.449
- Congratulations.
- I'm in. I'm totally in. You in, Kathy.

07:31.533 --> 07:33.245
- Of course I'm in.
- Yeah. Good.

07:33.328 --> 07:36.878
Afterwards we'll go for ice-cream
and we'll have an ice-cream cake.

07:37.671 --> 07:38.547
Yeah.

07:42.263 --> 07:43.098
<i>Dear Maya.</i>

07:48.150 --> 07:51.364
<i>I'm coming home early from the tour,
so, I can see my little girl's show.</i>

07:51.991 --> 07:55.539
<i>I am so proud.
See you soon! Love, Dad.</i>

08:08.733 --> 08:09.610
Very good.

08:10.779 --> 08:11.656
Excellent.

08:17.793 --> 08:19.170
All right, hold it.
Hold it, hold it.

08:19.672 --> 08:20.674
Hold it, hold it.

08:21.174 --> 08:22.426
What was that?

08:23.470 --> 08:24.974
You're late.

08:26.059 --> 08:27.144
- Let me see if we can work on this.
- OK.

08:27.228 --> 08:28.648
I just wanna... I know...
I know you can get it.

08:28.731 --> 08:30.025
- Yeah.
- All right. Yeah, but just from the top...

08:30.109 --> 08:31.779
- Hmm-hmm.
- ...and that's the first two beats, OK?

08:31.862 --> 08:34.158
- All right. OK.
- So count it out. One, two, three, four...

08:34.242 --> 08:35.452
One, two, three...

08:35.787 --> 08:38.793
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...

08:39.920 --> 08:41.089
Here, here.

08:42.008 --> 08:43.678
Am I early or late?

08:44.596 --> 08:46.099
Early.

08:46.182 --> 08:47.059
No.

08:47.435 --> 08:48.395
Late.

08:48.478 --> 08:50.399
No! Try it again. From the top, please.

08:50.482 --> 08:52.153
- One... One, two, three, four...
- ...three, four...

08:52.236 --> 08:54.617
No! Again! One, two, three, four...

08:54.700 --> 08:57.330
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...

08:57.413 --> 09:00.169
No, it's late, it's late, it's late.
Again, again, again!

09:03.300 --> 09:04.469
Saved by the bell.

09:04.553 --> 09:05.889
Miss Ishii-Peters.

09:06.641 --> 09:08.352
You need to practice this
before tomorrow, please.

09:08.728 --> 09:10.105
All right, everybody, let's pack it up.

09:13.236 --> 09:14.197
You'll get it.

09:14.698 --> 09:16.326
Can you help me after school?

09:16.368 --> 09:19.207
I have chorus practice. I would, but...

09:19.667 --> 09:22.839
- Or maybe Sam can help. Sam?
- No, don't ask him. Stop...

09:23.340 --> 09:25.804
- Sorry, he's already here.
- Fuck you, Anna.

09:25.887 --> 09:27.014
Can you help Maya?

09:27.557 --> 09:29.352
Sure. I am the best drummer in the bands.

09:29.728 --> 09:30.980
He kind of is, so...

09:31.064 --> 09:34.320
OK, fine, can you just, like, help me
after 3:00, I don't really care.

09:34.404 --> 09:36.867
- Yeah, I don't... I don't care either.
- I don't care either.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.957
Let's just not care and just
don't be late, but, like, whatever.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.296
- See you at 3:00.
- I'll see you at 3:00. Don't be late.

09:45.342 --> 09:46.637
Wait, is that for me?

09:47.806 --> 09:48.850
Hector.

09:50.310 --> 09:51.856
Oh, my God!

09:52.733 --> 09:54.402
It says Anna.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.824
- Really small. Yeah.
- What?

09:57.283 --> 09:58.368
Oh, my God.

10:00.164 --> 10:02.794
- Amazing!
- What does it say?

10:03.044 --> 10:04.213
I don't know. Doi!

10:04.297 --> 10:06.050
- I haven't read it yet. Doi.
- Uh! Doi.

10:08.598 --> 10:11.478
We are going to look
at the microscope today.

10:11.562 --> 10:14.192
We're gonna be very delicate.

10:14.275 --> 10:15.444
Time to pair up.

10:16.029 --> 10:20.412
Jared, you go with Connie.
Alex, go with Anna.

10:30.767 --> 10:31.769
What you're gonna do?

10:32.394 --> 10:34.566
- What's up?
- Oh, what's up?

10:40.912 --> 10:43.960
You smell nice.
Um, can you, like read that? Or...

10:44.753 --> 10:48.301
I can't quite... I don't know
how to use a microscope, so...

10:49.555 --> 10:54.105
It says, "I like playing
with you, Anna. Let's hang out sometime."

10:54.313 --> 10:55.859
Oh, my God!

10:58.113 --> 10:59.950
- Whoa!
- Who's Anna?

11:02.121 --> 11:03.624
It's just me. Stupid.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.672
- He... he likes you.
- Who?

11:08.008 --> 11:09.427
You? What?

11:14.103 --> 11:15.982
Who's... who's that?

11:16.482 --> 11:18.571
Oh, him. I don't know. Who cares.

11:19.740 --> 11:23.496
- Yeah.
- So, what's up with your,

11:23.831 --> 11:26.127
um, your G.F. or whatever?

11:26.461 --> 11:28.674
I broke up with her.
I don't have one anymore.

11:31.639 --> 11:33.559
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

11:33.976 --> 11:34.895
It's chill.

11:35.813 --> 11:37.232
What did you hate about her?

11:38.526 --> 11:41.532
She was just, like, always there.

11:41.617 --> 11:45.165
If I was your boyfriend,
I mean, girlfriend

11:45.332 --> 11:46.877
I would not be anywhere,

11:47.169 --> 11:49.006
unless you wanted me to be somewhere.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.010
And then I'd be there on time.

11:52.681 --> 11:53.641
Cool.

11:54.851 --> 11:56.855
It's crazy there's this, um...

11:57.481 --> 12:00.404
like, kind of music concert thingy
tomorrow night...

12:01.657 --> 12:02.993
- so...
- Cool.

12:04.161 --> 12:07.126
- And I'm in, like the band and chorus.
- Nice.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.507
I barely have time for a boyfriend,
but I do have a little.

12:11.217 --> 12:12.721
Are you gonna go, or...

12:13.764 --> 12:16.269
Well, I... I think we have to go.

12:23.158 --> 12:24.535
Like, hate that thing.

12:26.707 --> 12:28.753
Let's focus on the basics, all right?

12:29.503 --> 12:31.174
Let's start with your breath.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.677
All right?

12:33.637 --> 12:35.265
- Yeah.
- OK.

12:36.392 --> 12:37.854
OK. So, close your eyes.

12:41.402 --> 12:42.446
And breathe.

12:47.372 --> 12:48.333
Sound forward.

12:51.089 --> 12:52.216
We do one more.

13:00.273 --> 13:03.404
And who'll be auditioning
for a solo, raise of hands.

13:05.408 --> 13:07.204
Girls, fantastic.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.874

- Hi, Daddy.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.612
- Hey, Shuj.
- OK, Dad. Look at my new dance.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.706
Welcome home.

- Are you ready for the big day?
- Yeah.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.155
- Yeah? Timpani.
- Yeah. I know.

16:11.447 --> 16:13.952
- You need some help rehearsing?
- I'm killing it.

16:14.161 --> 16:16.165
- You are? I would love to see that.
- Yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:17.919
Can I see that?

16:17.960 --> 16:19.756
- Can I help you? I kill that.
- No, Dad, I'm like...

16:19.839 --> 16:21.091
I kill on Timpani.

16:21.467 --> 16:22.302
After dinner.

16:22.678 --> 16:25.768
Rehearsal, like do it
the solo in front of you?

16:25.851 --> 16:26.728
Yeah.

16:29.024 --> 16:30.443
OK. Hamper sounds good.

16:30.653 --> 16:33.282
- Dad. Stop!
- OK.

16:33.491 --> 16:34.953
So, start playing.

16:36.247 --> 16:40.839
- OK, just don't say it like that.
- I... I didn't say it like anything.

16:41.006 --> 16:42.718
Yes, you did.
Can you just shut up for a second,

16:42.802 --> 16:44.263
'cause I was about to play
and you are messing me up.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.181
Maya, just...

16:45.431 --> 16:48.605
- Come on, calm down.
- I am calm, Dad.

16:48.689 --> 16:51.736
I'm just trying to play for you,
so, can you, like, stop.

16:52.822 --> 16:55.201
Don't look at me like that.
It's gonna mess me up.

16:57.080 --> 16:57.999
Look away.

16:58.709 --> 17:02.007
Don't look at the drum,
literally look at that wall over there,

17:03.009 --> 17:03.885
and listen.

17:05.305 --> 17:06.850
Dad! OK.

17:10.148 --> 17:12.319
All right, all right,
I... I got to stop you.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.489
- Oh, my God!
- You are holding the mallets wrong.

17:14.574 --> 17:16.327
- You know, let me show you.
- Dad, this is why

17:16.452 --> 17:18.164
- I didn't want to do this with you.
- If you can't play for me

17:18.247 --> 17:20.001
- how you're gonna play for everyone else.
- I don't know

17:20.043 --> 17:24.051
because not everyone's in, like,
a professional Steely Dan Cover Band, Dad!

17:24.176 --> 17:26.890
And they never will be
if they don't know how to practice!

17:26.973 --> 17:28.977
Oh, no!

17:29.771 --> 17:32.233
Now, I'm gonna suck
tomorrow night 'cause of you.

17:32.359 --> 17:33.737
Oh, fine. It's all because of me.

17:33.862 --> 17:37.745
- Get out!
- Fine. I... I looked at your wrong.

17:37.828 --> 17:38.955
Yeah, you did.

17:46.261 --> 17:47.807
You know, Anna goes first today.

17:53.275 --> 17:56.240
Hi, Ma. I got you some ginger ale
to settle your tum.

17:58.662 --> 17:59.956
What are you doing?
You shouldn't look at the crowd.

18:00.039 --> 18:01.375
It's just gonna make you more nervous.

18:01.417 --> 18:02.293
You're right.

18:03.254 --> 18:04.548
Anna, your parents are here.

18:05.091 --> 18:06.427
- Together?
- Yeah.

18:08.514 --> 18:10.017
Oh, my God.
That is so embarrassing.

18:11.771 --> 18:12.982
Alex. Six o'clock.

18:15.571 --> 18:17.867
Oh, no, I don't know
what o'clock is. He's right there.

18:17.950 --> 18:18.785
Oh, where?

18:18.869 --> 18:21.165
- He has a rose.
- Oh, my God!

18:21.290 --> 18:24.004

Go.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.372
Great job.

- What?

23:43.350 --> 23:44.227
Hey, honey.

23:44.770 --> 23:45.647
Hey, Dad.

- Really great.

23:48.485 --> 23:50.990
- It was fine. No.
- So proud. Yeah.

23:51.074 --> 23:53.370
- Thanks.
- Your Mom had to leave early.

23:53.495 --> 23:56.334
Yeah, I know. I saw.
But I don't care. Is she OK?

23:56.418 --> 23:57.879
Yeah, she's fine. You know her.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.758

24:03.473 --> 24:04.392
Dang it.

24:04.893 --> 24:06.772
I forgot to buy you flowers.

24:06.897 --> 24:08.901
- Dad, stop, it's fine.
- I mean, look at that nice young man.

- OK, OK.

24:34.118 --> 24:36.247
Um, you're gonna ruin my shirt, Sweety.

24:57.498 --> 25:00.128
Did I like it? I... I will never forget it.

25:01.005 --> 25:02.801
- So, it wasn't amazing?
- It was.

25:02.884 --> 25:07.142
I... I don't think it fit with the...
with the rest of the show, but...

25:07.936 --> 25:09.480
- Uh...
- Thanks.

25:10.524 --> 25:11.569
It was amazing.

25:15.033 --> 25:18.708
You know I only made up that solo
to impress you, right?

25:19.876 --> 25:22.089
That I was only supposed to play
three notes.

25:27.099 --> 25:31.065
You... you don't have to come up
with some fancy solo to impress me.

25:33.361 --> 25:34.322
In music

25:35.365 --> 25:38.330
every single note is important.
I would be proud of you

25:38.831 --> 25:40.375
with just playing those three notes.

25:42.129 --> 25:43.006
Are we OK?

25:43.674 --> 25:44.635
Yeah.

25:45.970 --> 25:47.974
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey. Uh...

No, no, it's OK. It's all right.

Um, you know what?
Um, we'll see you outside.

25:53.819 --> 25:56.366
- Yeah, OK, we'll see you outside.
- OK, OK, all right. All right.

25:58.536 --> 26:00.082
So what? Are you like...

26:00.833 --> 26:02.002
Are you gonna make fun of me?

26:03.004 --> 26:04.591
Probably at some point but not tonight.

26:05.677 --> 26:07.889
Where did that come from?

26:08.223 --> 26:09.726
I don't know, like...

26:10.603 --> 26:12.064
You really like <i>The Exorcist.</i>

26:14.360 --> 26:16.865
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

26:16.990 --> 26:20.539
- How was I?
- Oh, my God. That was crazy.

26:21.625 --> 26:23.545
- Oh, did you find Alex?
- Hmm-hmm.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.637
- And?
- Can't really talk about it.

26:29.265 --> 26:30.392
Oh!

26:30.810 --> 26:32.354
Sometimes love means...

26:32.772 --> 26:34.651
um, ignoring someone for years.

26:35.193 --> 26:37.406
- That's a 100% true.
- Yeah.

26:37.866 --> 26:40.245
Um, can you look at this for me?

26:40.537 --> 26:41.539
What is it?

26:42.082 --> 26:44.003
- Nothing, it's...
- Back off.

26:49.013 --> 26:50.725
He did it a little bigger this time.

26:51.935 --> 26:54.023

26:54.775 --> 26:56.068
What are you gonna say?

26:57.572 --> 26:59.033
Which one should I say?

27:15.398 --> 27:18.906
- I have a boyfriend! We do!
- We have a boyfriend!
