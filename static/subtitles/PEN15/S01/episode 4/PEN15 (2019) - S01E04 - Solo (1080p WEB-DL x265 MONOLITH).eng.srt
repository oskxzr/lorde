1
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:13,074
Maya, Shuji, fax...

2
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,128
OK.

3
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:21,842
<i>Dear family...</i>

4
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:24,639
<i>...arrived in Cleveland today.</i>

5
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:29,315
<i>The weather is cold,
but my drumsticks are on fire!</i>

6
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:30,776
<i>How are you all?</i>

7
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:34,241
<i>Miss you very much. Love, Dad.</i>

8
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:38,626
<i>Dear Dad, I miss you so much.</i>

9
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:41,255
<i>Yesterday I scored a goal at soccer.</i>

10
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:42,424
I wasn't ready.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,679
I was right there with you.

12
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:46,265
Get it, Alice.

13
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:49,355
<i>Dear Maya. I wish
I could've been there to see your goal.</i>

14
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:52,277
<i>I'm not surprised though,
I was quite the athlete myself.</i>

15
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,783
<i>Must be in the genes! How's Anna?</i>

16
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,578
<i>Are you making any new friends?</i>

17
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:59,249
<i>Dear Dad,
Anna's still my best friend,</i>

18
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,506
<i>but my impression of Jim Carey
is getting really good</i>

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,053
<i>and there are at least four popular kids
that want to be our bf's,</i>

20
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:06,640
<i>"Best friends" now.</i>

21
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:11,023
<i>I'm also starting to sleep
in my own bed more. Ask Mom.</i>

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,442
<i>Actually don't.</i>

23
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:16,910
<i>Dear Maya. That sounds nice.
I miss sleeping in the bed with your mom.</i>

24
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,835
<i>It's lonely out on the road sometimes.
We've all got our ways of dealing with it.</i>

25
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:23,799
<i>For me, it's reading your letters.</i>

26
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,343
<i>So, please keep sending!</i>

27
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:26,847
<i>Love, Dad.</i>

28
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:12,897
What?

29
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:17,531
Alex broke up with Heather.

30
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,036
Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm.

31
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,040
Are you losing your mind?

32
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,505
- It's all happening.
- It's all happening.

33
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:27,509
This is the moment. Oh, my God.

34
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:36,360
All right, everybody,
take your seats, please.

35
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,788
- I have some very exciting news.
- Alex Nolan is single.

36
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:48,844
I mean, like, if you're a girl
that's more exciting

37
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:50,263
maybe.

38
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:54,606
Just like, you know
the whole school's been talking about it.

39
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,277
I'm not weird, you guys are weird.

40
00:02:58,404 --> 00:02:59,281
OK.

41
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:03,665
This Friday is Trailview Middle's
"Night of Amazing Music"

42
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:07,715
which means the band and the chorus
will be performing for the whole school.

43
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:12,182
And what's more,
you all will be performing

44
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:15,648
an original piece of music,
written by yours truly.

45
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,693
You'll find the music on your stands.

46
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,866
Na, I only have three notes solo.
How many do you have?

47
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,995
I have, like a five-measure solo.

48
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,041
All right,
let's try the piece. Shall we?

49
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,504
One, two, three...

50
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,407
All right, hol...
Just hold it.

51
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,369
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.

52
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:46,458
Timpani. I... I don't know
what that is you're playing

53
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,212
but you should be playing

54
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:50,341
a straight 4/4 count in time.

55
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:53,097
Yeah, sorry.
Do you mean the snare 'cause I feel like

56
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,936
- Timpani was doing four, four.
- No, Timpani... No, the snare is fine...

57
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:58,357
Try to stay within the four, four times.

58
00:03:58,441 --> 00:03:59,569
You want me to do it differently?

59
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,405
- 'Cause I was doing a four, four.
- So... No, right. Somewhere in there.

60
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,577
I'll tell you what. Play it like your dad.

61
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,081
Why don't we try it
from the top again.

62
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,381
Do you wanna watch me practice

63
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:12,385
for my chorus solo audition later?

64
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,974
I mean, I would,
but I have enough on my plate

65
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:16,853
with that three notes solo,
you know what I mean?

66
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:19,942
- But you're the best singer I know, so...
- Yeah.

67
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,407
Do you think Alex is gonna come
to the show later?

68
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:26,538
- Yeah, it's kind of... Oh, my God.
- Hey.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,546
- Hey.
- I'm, uh, I'm Brendan.

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,096
- I'm Anna.
- I know who you are.

71
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:35,766
We're in band together.

72
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:38,688
I mean, anyone who does music
at Trailview knows you.

73
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:40,274
Really?

74
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,613
Are you excited
for the "Night of Amazing Music"?

75
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:43,865
Sure. I am, yeah.

76
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,661
- What... Are you Maya?
- Yeah.

77
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,832
I'm gonna get a new hat
after school for it.

78
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,296
- Are you allowed to do that?
- I'll do what I want.

79
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:53,342
OK.

80
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:56,098
Good.

81
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,856
Oh, my God!

82
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:13,675
- Where?
- Um...

83
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:16,639
After you've build the deck.

84
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,562
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:21,064
- Why not?
- I don't know.

86
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:24,487
- What's the question?
- The question is...

87
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:27,912
- I forgot the question.
- The question is...

88
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:30,333
When you've build the deck.

89
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:33,965
- Question and the answer is...
- Pretty anemones.

Mom, help me with the fax.

106
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:47,905
Mom!

107
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:50,660
Ah.

108
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,123
- Oh my God, Dad!
- What?

109
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:54,835
What?

110
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:57,131
I have one good eye left, OK?

111
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,094
I'll protect you from this one.

112
00:06:59,177 --> 00:06:59,970
I don't think it's funny.

113
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:02,851
Look, mom, I am dad
and I'm 12 feet away from the flame.

114
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:05,690
That's not what I did.

115
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:07,318
- That is what you did. You're like...
- That's not what I did.

116
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:09,907
It's so far away.

117
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,326
- OK.
- That's immature.

118
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:12,830
Oh, you think so? Don't you dare.

119
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:15,669
How was school today, sweetheart?

120
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:19,425
Um, it was good,
like I have a music concert on Friday.

121
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:21,429
And I have a solo in band

122
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:25,146
and I also have a chorus solo hopefully,
if it goes well...

123
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:26,691
Oh, that's great, no?

124
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:29,028
- That's amazing.
- I'm so proud. Yeah.

125
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:31,449
- Congratulations.
- I'm in. I'm totally in. You in, Kathy.

126
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,245
- Of course I'm in.
- Yeah. Good.

127
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,878
Afterwards we'll go for ice-cream
and we'll have an ice-cream cake.

128
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:38,547
Yeah.

129
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:43,098
<i>Dear Maya.</i>

130
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,364

so, I can see my little girl's show.</i>

131
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:55,539

See you soon! Love, Dad.</i>

132
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:09,610
Very good.

133
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:11,656
Excellent.

134
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:19,170
All right, hold it.
Hold it, hold it.

135
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:20,674
Hold it, hold it.

136
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:22,426
What was that?

137
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,974
You're late.

138
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,144
- Let me see if we can work on this.
- OK.

139
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:28,648
I just wanna... I know...
I know you can get it.

140
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,025
- Yeah.
- All right. Yeah, but just from the top...

141
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,779
- Hmm-hmm.
- ...and that's the first two beats, OK?

142
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:34,158
- All right. OK.
- So count it out. One, two, three, four...

143
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:35,452
One, two, three...

144
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:38,793
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...

145
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,089
Here, here.

146
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:43,678
Am I early or late?

147
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:46,099
Early.

148
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:47,059
No.

149
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:48,395
Late.

150
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:50,399
No! Try it again. From the top, please.

151
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:52,153
- One... One, two, three, four...
- ...three, four...

152
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:54,617
No! Again! One, two, three, four...

153
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,330
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...

154
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:00,169
No, it's late, it's late, it's late.
Again, again, again!

155
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,469
Saved by the bell.

156
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:05,889
Miss Ishii-Peters.

157
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:08,352
You need to practice this
before tomorrow, please.

158
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,105
All right, everybody, let's pack it up.

159
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:14,197
You'll get it.

160
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:16,326
Can you help me after school?

161
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:19,207
I have chorus practice. I would, but...

162
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,839
- Or maybe Sam can help. Sam?
- No, don't ask him. Stop...

163
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,804
- Sorry, he's already here.
- Fuck you, Anna.

164
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,014
Can you help Maya?

165
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:29,352
Sure. I am the best drummer in the bands.

166
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:30,980
He kind of is, so...

167
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:34,320
OK, fine, can you just, like, help me
after 3:00, I don't really care.

168
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,867
- Yeah, I don't... I don't care either.
- I don't care either.

169
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,957
Let's just not care and just
don't be late, but, like, whatever.

170
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,296
- See you at 3:00.
- I'll see you at 3:00. Don't be late.

171
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:46,637
Wait, is that for me?

172
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:48,850
Hector.

173
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,856
Oh, my God!

174
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,402
It says Anna.

175
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,824
- Really small. Yeah.
- What?

176
00:09:57,283 --> 00:09:58,368
Oh, my God.

177
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,794
- Amazing!
- What does it say?

178
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:04,213
I don't know. Doi!

179
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:06,050
- I haven't read it yet. Doi.
- Uh! Doi.

180
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:11,478
We are going to look
at the microscope today.

181
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:14,192
We're gonna be very delicate.

182
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:15,444
Time to pair up.

183
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,412
Jared, you go with Connie.
Alex, go with Anna.

184
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:31,769
What you're gonna do?

185
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:34,566
- What's up?
- Oh, what's up?

186
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:43,960
You smell nice.
Um, can you, like read that? Or...

187
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:48,301
I can't quite... I don't know
how to use a microscope, so...

188
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:54,105
It says, "I like playing
with you, Anna. Let's hang out sometime."

189
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,859
Oh, my God!

190
00:10:58,113 --> 00:10:59,950
- Whoa!
- Who's Anna?

191
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:03,624
It's just me. Stupid.

192
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,672
- He... he likes you.
- Who?

193
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,427
You? What?

194
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:15,982
Who's... who's that?

195
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:18,571
Oh, him. I don't know. Who cares.

196
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,496
- Yeah.
- So, what's up with your,

197
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:26,127
um, your G.F. or whatever?

198
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:28,674
I broke up with her.
I don't have one anymore.

199
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,559
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

200
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:34,895
It's chill.

201
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:37,232
What did you hate about her?

202
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:41,532
She was just, like, always there.

203
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,165
If I was your boyfriend,
I mean, girlfriend

204
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:46,877
I would not be anywhere,

205
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:49,006
unless you wanted me to be somewhere.

206
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,010
And then I'd be there on time.

207
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:53,641
Cool.

208
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:56,855
It's crazy there's this, um...

209
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:00,404
like, kind of music concert thingy
tomorrow night...

210
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:02,993
- so...
- Cool.

211
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:07,126
- And I'm in, like the band and chorus.
- Nice.

212
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,507
I barely have time for a boyfriend,
but I do have a little.

213
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:12,721
Are you gonna go, or...

214
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:16,269
Well, I... I think we have to go.

215
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,535
Like, hate that thing.

216
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:28,753
Let's focus on the basics, all right?

217
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,174
Let's start with your breath.

218
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,677
All right?

219
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,265
- Yeah.
- OK.

220
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,854
OK. So, close your eyes.

221
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:42,446
And breathe.

222
00:12:47,372 --> 00:12:48,333
Sound forward.

223
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,216
We do one more.

224
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:03,404
And who'll be auditioning
for a solo, raise of hands.

225
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:07,204
Girls, fantastic.

226
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,874
Heather, come on up.
You're gonna go first.

227

everyone, no laughs, no sounds.

228
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,468

You guys have made my decision tough.

251
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:21,723
Anna, you will be singing the two-bar solo

252
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:23,184
and, Heather, you will doing

253
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:25,105

Thank you.

- And then Commonwealth of Nations.
- Hmm-hmm.

257
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,795
But then I wonder if, like the...

258
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:40,761
Daddy!

259
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:43,057
Oh! Sweetheart! Oh!

- Hi, Daddy.

261
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:49,612
- Hey, Shuj.
- OK, Dad. Look at my new dance.

262
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,706
Welcome home.

263
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:57,837
- Dad, look.
- That's great.

264
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,425
Gigs went really, really great.

265
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:01,427
Oh, man!

266
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,849
So good to see you guys!

267
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:08,650
- Are you ready for the big day?
- Yeah.

268
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,155
- Yeah? Timpani.
- Yeah. I know.

269
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:13,952
- You need some help rehearsing?
- I'm killing it.

270
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:16,165
- You are? I would love to see that.
- Yeah.

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,919
Can I see that?

272
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,756
- Can I help you? I kill that.
- No, Dad, I'm like...

273
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,091
I kill on Timpani.

274
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:22,302
After dinner.

275
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:25,768
Rehearsal, like do it
the solo in front of you?

276
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,728
Yeah.

277
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:30,443
OK. Hamper sounds good.

278
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:33,282
- Dad. Stop!
- OK.

279
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:34,953
So, start playing.

280
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:40,839
- OK, just don't say it like that.
- I... I didn't say it like anything.

281
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,718
Yes, you did.
Can you just shut up for a second,

282
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,263
'cause I was about to play
and you are messing me up.

283
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,181
Maya, just...

284
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:48,605
- Come on, calm down.
- I am calm, Dad.

285
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:51,736
I'm just trying to play for you,
so, can you, like, stop.

286
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:55,201
Don't look at me like that.
It's gonna mess me up.

287
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,999
Look away.

288
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,007
Don't look at the drum,
literally look at that wall over there,

289
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:03,885
and listen.

290
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:06,850
Dad! OK.

291
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:12,319
All right, all right,
I... I got to stop you.

292
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,489
- Oh, my God!
- You are holding the mallets wrong.

293
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:16,327
- You know, let me show you.
- Dad, this is why

294
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,164
- I didn't want to do this with you.
- If you can't play for me

295
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,001
- how you're gonna play for everyone else.
- I don't know

296
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:24,051
because not everyone's in, like,
a professional Steely Dan Cover Band, Dad!

297
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,890
And they never will be
if they don't know how to practice!

298
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:28,977
Oh, no!

299
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:32,233
Now, I'm gonna suck
tomorrow night 'cause of you.

300
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,737
Oh, fine. It's all because of me.

301
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:37,745
- Get out!
- Fine. I... I looked at your wrong.

302
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:38,955
Yeah, you did.

303
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:47,807
You know, Anna goes first today.

304
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:56,240
Hi, Ma. I got you some ginger ale
to settle your tum.

305
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,956
What are you doing?
You shouldn't look at the crowd.

306
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,375
It's just gonna make you more nervous.

307
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,293
You're right.

308
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:04,548
Anna, your parents are here.

309
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:06,427
- Together?
- Yeah.

310
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:10,017
Oh, my God.
That is so embarrassing.

311
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:12,982
Alex. Six o'clock.

312
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,867
Oh, no, I don't know
what o'clock is. He's right there.

313
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,785
Oh, where?

314
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,165
- He has a rose.
- Oh, my God!

315
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,004
- He came.
- I'm getting nervous actually.

316
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,895
Ladies and gentlemen,

Sam, can you take my solo
'cause my hands are claws.

325
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,522
- Just remember what I said.
- What... what did you say?

326
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:00,901
What did you say?

327
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,950
Hey, Anna, your song was awesome.

328
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,413
- Oh, really?
- You really act it out.

329

hard at work on an original song

333
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:30,459
composed by me.

334
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:12,168
Just breathe.

335
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:55,087
One. two...

Great job.

338
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,760

- What?

Hey, honey.

340
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,647

You were great.

342
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,318
- Oh, thanks.
- Really great.

343
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:50,990
- It was fine. No.
- So proud. Yeah.

344
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:53,370

- Your Mom had to leave early.

345
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:56,334
Yeah, I know. I saw.
But I don't care. Is she OK?

346
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:57,879
Yeah, she's fine. You know her.

347
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,758
She was in, uh, a mood.

348
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:01,595
Yeah.

349
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:04,392
Dang it.

350
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,772
I forgot to buy you flowers.

351
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:08,901
- Dad, stop, it's fine.
- I mean, look at that nice young man.

352
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:10,487
He's got flowers.

353
00:24:24,683 --> 00:24:25,517
You know what?

354
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:29,400
Here. Five, six, seven... Seven...

355
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,906
Seven dollars. There.

356
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:33,993
- Dad, it's fine.
- OK, OK.

357
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:36,247
Um, you're gonna ruin my shirt, Sweety.

358
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:38,043
- OK. You know what?
- OK.

359
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:39,420
You were great.

360
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:48,146
Maya?

361
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:52,279
Can I... can I come back?

362
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:54,618
How are you? You OK?

363
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,206
Did you like my solo?

364
00:24:57,498 --> 00:25:00,128
Did I like it? I... I will never forget it.

365
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:02,801
- So, it wasn't amazing?
- It was.

366
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:07,142
I... I don't think it fit with the...
with the rest of the show, but...

367
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:09,480
- Uh...
- Thanks.

368
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:11,569
It was amazing.

369
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:18,708
You know I only made up that solo
to impress you, right?

370
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:22,089
That I was only supposed to play
three notes.

371
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:31,065
You... you don't have to come up
with some fancy solo to impress me.

372
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:34,322
In music

373
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:38,330
every single note is important.
I would be proud of you

374
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,375
with just playing those three notes.

375
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:43,006
Are we OK?

376
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:44,635
Yeah.

377
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,974
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey. Uh...

378
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:49,728
No, no, it's OK. It's all right.

379
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,736
Um, you know what?
Um, we'll see you outside.

380
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,366
- Yeah, OK, we'll see you outside.
- OK, OK, all right. All right.

381
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:00,082
So what? Are you like...

382
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,002
Are you gonna make fun of me?

383
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:04,591
Probably at some point but not tonight.

384
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:07,889
Where did that come from?

385
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:09,726
I don't know, like...

386
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,064
You really like <i>The Exorcist.</i>

387
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,865
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

388
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,539
- How was I?
- Oh, my God. That was crazy.

389
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,545
- Oh, did you find Alex?
- Hmm-hmm.

390
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,637
- And?
- Can't really talk about it.

391
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:30,392
Oh!

392
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,354
Sometimes love means...

393
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:34,651
um, ignoring someone for years.

394
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,406
- That's a 100% true.
- Yeah.

395
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:40,245
Um, can you look at this for me?

396
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:41,539
What is it?

397
00:26:42,082 --> 00:26:44,003
- Nothing, it's...
- Back off.

398
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:50,725
He did it a little bigger this time.

399
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:54,023
I guess he like loves me or whatever.

400
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:56,068
What are you gonna say?

401
00:26:57,572 --> 00:26:59,033
Which one should I say?

402
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:18,906
- I have a boyfriend! We do!
- We have a boyfriend!

403
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:56,147
<i>Dear Maya, it's tough
having to get back on the road</i>

404
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,443
<i>but your performance inspired me.</i>

405
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,196
<i>We've got a pretty big gig in Florida.</i>

406
00:28:00,405 --> 00:28:03,286
<i>Had my own solo
and it brought down the house!</i>

407
00:28:12,972 --> 00:28:14,350
<i>Wish you could've seen me.</i>

408
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:16,020
<i>Love, Dad.</i>
