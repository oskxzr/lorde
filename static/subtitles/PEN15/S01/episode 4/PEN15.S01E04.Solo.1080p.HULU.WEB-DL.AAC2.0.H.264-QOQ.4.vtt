00:08.141 --> 00:12.024
Maya, Shuji, fax...

00:16.951 --> 00:18.078
OK.

00:19.413 --> 00:20.792
<i>Dear family...</i>

00:22.127 --> 00:23.589
<i>arrived in Cleveland today.</i>

00:24.423 --> 00:28.265
<i>The weather is cold,
but my drumsticks are on fire!</i>

00:28.808 --> 00:29.808
<i>How are you all?</i>

00:30.645 --> 00:33.191
<i>Miss you very much. Love, Dad.</i>

00:35.112 --> 00:37.576
<i>Dear Dad, I miss you so much.</i>

00:37.993 --> 00:40.205
<i>Yesterday I scored a goal at soccer.</i>

00:40.289 --> 00:41.374
I wasn't ready.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.629
I was right there with you.

00:44.171 --> 00:45.215
Get it, Alice.

00:45.299 --> 00:48.305
<i>Dear Maya. I wish
I could've been there to see your goal.</i>

00:48.388 --> 00:51.227
<i>I'm not surprised though,
I was quite the athlete myself.</i>

00:51.436 --> 00:53.733
<i>Must be in the genes! How's Anna?</i>

00:53.983 --> 00:55.528
<i>Are you making any new friends?</i>

00:55.862 --> 00:58.199
<i>Dear Dad,
Anna's still my best friend,</i>

00:58.283 --> 01:01.456
<i>but my impression of Jim Carey
is getting really good</i>

01:01.540 --> 01:04.140
<i>and there are at least four popular kids
that want to be our bf's,</i>

01:04.378 --> 01:05.590
<i>"Best friends" now.</i>

01:06.842 --> 01:09.973
<i>I'm also starting to sleep
in my own bed more. Ask Mom.</i>

01:10.390 --> 01:11.392
<i>Actually don't.</i>

01:11.852 --> 01:15.860
<i>Dear Maya. That sounds nice.
I miss sleeping in the bed with your mom.</i>

01:16.027 --> 01:19.785
<i>It's lonely out on the road sometimes.
We've all got our ways of dealing with it.</i>

01:20.327 --> 01:22.749
<i>For me, it's reading your letters.</i>

01:22.999 --> 01:24.293
<i>So, please keep sending!</i>

02:17.399 --> 02:18.986
Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm.

02:19.529 --> 02:20.990
Are you losing your mind?

02:22.619 --> 02:24.455
- It's all happening.
- It's all happening.

02:24.539 --> 02:26.459
This is the moment. Oh, my God.

02:33.056 --> 02:35.310
All right, everybody,
take your seats, please.

02:37.774 --> 02:40.738
- I have some very exciting news.
- Alex Nolan is single.

02:43.911 --> 02:47.794
I mean, like, if you're a girl
that's more exciting

02:48.378 --> 02:49.378
maybe.

02:49.965 --> 02:53.556
Just like, you know
the whole school's been talking about it.

02:53.889 --> 02:56.227
I'm not weird, you guys are weird.

02:57.354 --> 02:58.354
OK.

02:59.066 --> 03:02.615
This Friday is Trailview Middle's
"Night of Amazing Music"

03:02.699 --> 03:06.665
which means the band and the chorus
will be performing for the whole school.

03:08.502 --> 03:11.132
And what's more,
you all will be performing

03:11.508 --> 03:14.598
an original piece of music,
written by yours truly.

03:15.056 --> 03:16.643
You'll find the music on your stands.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.816
Na, I only have three notes solo.
How many do you have?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.945
I have, like a five-measure solo.

03:22.321 --> 03:23.991
All right,
let's try the piece. Shall we?

03:24.408 --> 03:26.454
One, two, three...

03:39.271 --> 03:40.416
All right, hol...
Just hold it.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.319
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.

03:42.486 --> 03:45.408
Timpani. I... I don't know
what that is you're playing

03:45.492 --> 03:47.162
but you should be playing

03:47.454 --> 03:49.291
a straight 4/4 count in time.

03:49.375 --> 03:52.047
Yeah, sorry.
Do you mean the snare 'cause I feel like

03:52.130 --> 03:54.945
- Timpani was doing four, four.
- No, Timpani... No, the snare is fine...

03:54.969 --> 03:57.307
Try to stay within the four, four times.

03:57.391 --> 03:58.578
You want me to do it differently?

03:58.602 --> 04:00.414
- 'Cause I was doing a four, four.
- So... No, right. Somewhere in there.

04:00.438 --> 04:02.527
I'll tell you what. Play it like your dad.

04:03.236 --> 04:05.031
Why don't we try it
from the top again.

04:07.578 --> 04:09.331
Do you wanna watch me practice

04:09.415 --> 04:11.335
for my chorus solo audition later?

04:11.419 --> 04:13.924
I mean, I would,
but I have enough on my plate

04:14.007 --> 04:15.927
with that three notes solo,
you know what I mean?

04:16.095 --> 04:18.892
- But you're the best singer I know, so...
- Yeah.

04:20.145 --> 04:22.357
Do you think Alex is gonna come
to the show later?

04:22.441 --> 04:25.488
- Yeah, it's kind of... Oh, my God.
- Hey.

04:26.950 --> 04:29.496
- Hey.
- I'm, uh, I'm Brendan.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.046
- I'm Anna.
- I know who you are.

04:33.672 --> 04:34.716
We're in band together.

04:34.799 --> 04:37.638
I mean, anyone who does music
at Trailview knows you.

04:38.347 --> 04:39.224
Really?

04:39.349 --> 04:41.563
Are you excited
for the "Night of Amazing Music"?

04:41.646 --> 04:42.815
Sure. I am, yeah.

04:42.899 --> 04:44.611
- What... Are you Maya?
- Yeah.

04:44.694 --> 04:46.782
I'm gonna get a new hat
after school for it.

04:47.909 --> 04:50.246
- Are you allowed to do that?
- I'll do what I want.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.457
OK.

04:54.171 --> 04:55.171
Good.

04:56.467 --> 04:58.806
Oh, my God!

05:11.205 --> 05:12.625
- Where?
- Um...

05:12.708 --> 05:15.589
After you've build the deck.

05:16.591 --> 05:18.512
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:18.595 --> 05:20.014
- Why not?
- I don't know.

05:20.181 --> 05:23.437
- What's the question?
- The question is...

05:24.148 --> 05:26.862
- I forgot the question.
- The question is...

05:27.697 --> 05:29.283
When you've build the deck.

05:29.993 --> 05:32.915
- Question and the answer is...
- Pretty anemones.

Mom!

Ah.

- Oh my God, Dad!
- What?

06:52.157 --> 06:53.785
What?

06:54.286 --> 06:56.081
I have one good eye left, OK?

06:56.165 --> 06:58.044
I'll protect you from this one.

06:58.127 --> 06:58.920
I don't think it's funny.

06:59.004 --> 07:01.801
Look, mom, I am dad
and I'm 12 feet away from the flame.

07:03.764 --> 07:04.640
That's not what I did.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.079
- That is what you did. You're like...
- That's not what I did.

07:07.103 --> 07:08.857
It's so far away.

07:08.940 --> 07:10.276
- OK.
- That's immature.

07:10.359 --> 07:11.780
Oh, you think so? Don't you dare.

07:11.863 --> 07:14.619
How was school today, sweetheart?

07:15.161 --> 07:18.375
Um, it was good,
like I have a music concert on Friday.

07:18.502 --> 07:20.379
And I have a solo in band

07:20.463 --> 07:24.096
and I also have a chorus solo hopefully,
if it goes well...

07:24.179 --> 07:25.641
Oh, that's great, no?

07:25.724 --> 07:27.978
- That's amazing.
- I'm so proud. Yeah.

07:28.354 --> 07:30.459
- Congratulations.
- I'm in. I'm totally in. You in, Kathy.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.195
- Of course I'm in.
- Yeah. Good.

07:32.278 --> 07:35.828
Afterwards we'll go for ice-cream
and we'll have an ice-cream cake.

08:07.683 --> 08:08.683
Very good.

08:09.729 --> 08:10.729
Excellent.

08:16.743 --> 08:18.183
All right, hold it.
Hold it, hold it.

08:18.622 --> 08:19.624
Hold it, hold it.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.376
What was that?

08:22.420 --> 08:23.924
You're late.

08:25.009 --> 08:26.154
- Let me see if we can work on this.
- OK.

08:26.178 --> 08:27.657
I just wanna... I know...
I know you can get it.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.035
- Yeah.
- All right. Yeah, but just from the top...

08:29.059 --> 08:30.788
- Hmm-hmm.
- And that's the first two beats, OK?

08:30.812 --> 08:33.168
- All right. OK.
- So count it out. One, two, three, four...

08:33.192 --> 08:34.402
One, two, three...

08:34.737 --> 08:37.743
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...

Here, here.

08:40.958 --> 08:42.628
Am I early or late?

08:43.546 --> 08:45.049
Early.

08:45.132 --> 08:46.132
No.

08:46.385 --> 08:47.385
Late.

08:47.428 --> 08:49.349
No! Try it again. From the top, please.

08:49.432 --> 08:51.162
- One... One, two, three, four...
- three, four...

08:51.186 --> 08:53.567
No! Again! One, two, three, four...

08:53.650 --> 08:56.280
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three...

08:56.363 --> 08:59.119
No, it's late, it's late, it's late.
Again, again, again!

09:02.250 --> 09:03.419
Saved by the bell.

09:03.503 --> 09:04.839
Miss Ishii-Peters.

09:05.591 --> 09:07.551
You need to practice this
before tomorrow, please.

09:07.678 --> 09:09.238
All right, everybody, let's pack it up.

09:12.186 --> 09:13.186
You'll get it.

09:13.648 --> 09:15.276
Can you help me after school?

09:15.318 --> 09:18.157
I have chorus practice. I would, but...

09:18.617 --> 09:21.789
- Or maybe Sam can help. Sam?
- No, don't ask him. Stop...

09:22.290 --> 09:24.754
- Sorry, he's already here.
- Fuck you, Anna.

09:24.837 --> 09:25.964
Can you help Maya?

09:26.507 --> 09:28.302
Sure. I am the best drummer in the bands.

09:28.678 --> 09:29.930
He kind of is, so...

09:30.014 --> 09:33.270
OK, fine, can you just, like, help me
after 3:00, I don't really care.

09:33.354 --> 09:35.817
- Yeah, I don't... I don't care either.
- I don't care either.

09:35.901 --> 09:38.907
Let's just not care and just
don't be late, but, like, whatever.

09:39.742 --> 09:42.246
- See you at 3:00.
- I'll see you at 3:00. Don't be late.

Oh, my God.

09:59.114 --> 10:01.744
- Amazing!
- What does it say?

10:01.994 --> 10:03.163
I don't know. Doi!

10:03.247 --> 10:05.000
- I haven't read it yet. Doi.
- Uh! Doi.

10:07.548 --> 10:10.428
We are going to look
at the microscope today.

10:10.512 --> 10:13.142
We're gonna be very delicate.

10:13.225 --> 10:14.394
Time to pair up.

11:22.781 --> 11:25.077
um, your G.F. or whatever?

11:25.411 --> 11:27.624
I broke up with her.
I don't have one anymore.

11:37.476 --> 11:40.482
She was just, like, always there.

11:40.567 --> 11:44.115
If I was your boyfriend,
I mean, girlfriend

11:44.282 --> 11:45.827
I would not be anywhere,

11:46.119 --> 11:47.956
unless you wanted me to be somewhere.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.960
And then I'd be there on time.

- Cool.

12:03.111 --> 12:06.076
- And I'm in, like the band and chorus.
- Nice.

12:06.911 --> 12:09.457
I barely have time for a boyfriend,
but I do have a little.

12:10.167 --> 12:11.671
Are you gonna go, or...

12:12.714 --> 12:15.219
Well, I... I think we have to go.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.485
Like, hate that thing.

12:25.657 --> 12:27.703
Let's focus on the basics, all right?

Oh! Sweetheart! Oh!

- It's so good to see you. Oh!
- Hi, Daddy.

15:45.765 --> 15:48.562
- Hey, Shuj.
- OK, Dad. Look at my new dance.

15:51.527 --> 15:53.656
Welcome home.

15:54.574 --> 15:56.787
- Dad, look.
- That's great.

15:56.870 --> 15:59.375
Gigs went really, really great.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.377
Oh, man!

16:00.460 --> 16:02.799
So good to see you guys!

16:05.513 --> 16:07.600
- Are you ready for the big day?
- Yeah.

16:07.684 --> 16:10.105
- Yeah? Timpani.
- Yeah. I know.

16:10.397 --> 16:12.902
- You need some help rehearsing?
- I'm killing it.

16:13.111 --> 16:15.115
- You are? I would love to see that.
- Yeah.

16:15.950 --> 16:16.869
Can I see that?

16:16.910 --> 16:18.765
- Can I help you? I kill that.
- No, Dad, I'm like...

16:18.789 --> 16:20.041
I kill on Timpani.

16:20.417 --> 16:21.417
After dinner.

16:21.628 --> 16:24.718
Rehearsal, like do it
the solo in front of you?

16:24.801 --> 16:25.801
Yeah.

16:27.974 --> 16:29.393
OK. Hamper sounds good.

16:29.603 --> 16:32.232
- Dad. Stop!
- OK.

16:32.441 --> 16:33.903
So, start playing.

16:35.197 --> 16:39.789
- OK, just don't say it like that.
- I... I didn't say it like anything.

16:39.956 --> 16:41.728
Yes, you did.
Can you just shut up for a second,

16:41.752 --> 16:43.230
'cause I was about to play
and you are messing me up.

16:43.254 --> 16:44.254
Maya, just...

16:44.381 --> 16:47.555
- Come on, calm down.
- I am calm, Dad.

16:47.639 --> 16:50.686
I'm just trying to play for you,
so, can you, like, stop.

16:51.772 --> 16:54.151
Don't look at me like that.
It's gonna mess me up.

16:56.030 --> 16:57.030
Look away.

16:57.659 --> 17:00.957
Don't look at the drum,
literally look at that wall over there,

17:01.959 --> 17:02.959
and listen.

17:04.255 --> 17:05.800
Dad! OK.

17:09.098 --> 17:11.269
All right, all right,
I... I got to stop you.

17:11.310 --> 17:13.439
- Oh, my God!
- You are holding the mallets wrong.

17:13.524 --> 17:15.364
- You know, let me show you.
- Dad, this is why

17:15.402 --> 17:17.173
- I didn't want to do this with you.
- If you can't play for me

17:17.197 --> 17:18.969
- how you're gonna play for everyone else.
- I don't know

17:18.993 --> 17:23.001
because not everyone's in, like,
a professional Steely Dan Cover Band, Dad!

17:23.126 --> 17:25.840
And they never will be
if they don't know how to practice!

17:25.923 --> 17:27.927
Oh, no!

17:28.721 --> 17:31.183
Now, I'm gonna suck
tomorrow night 'cause of you.

17:31.309 --> 17:32.687
Oh, fine. It's all because of me.

17:32.812 --> 17:36.695
- Get out!
- Fine. I... I looked at your wrong.

17:36.778 --> 17:37.905
Yeah, you did.

17:45.211 --> 17:46.757
You know, Anna goes first today.

17:52.225 --> 17:55.190
Hi, Ma. I got you some ginger ale
to settle your tum.

17:57.612 --> 17:58.965
What are you doing?
You shouldn't look at the crowd.

17:58.989 --> 18:00.343
It's just gonna make you more nervous.

18:00.367 --> 18:01.367
You're right.

18:02.204 --> 18:03.498
Anna, your parents are here.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.377
- Together?
- Yeah.

18:07.464 --> 18:08.967
Oh, my God.
That is so embarrassing.

18:10.721 --> 18:11.932
Alex. Six o'clock.

18:14.521 --> 18:16.817
Oh, no, I don't know
what o'clock is. He's right there.

18:16.900 --> 18:17.735
Oh, where?

18:17.819 --> 18:20.115
- He has a rose.
- Oh, my God!

18:20.240 --> 18:22.954
- He came.
- I'm getting nervous actually.
