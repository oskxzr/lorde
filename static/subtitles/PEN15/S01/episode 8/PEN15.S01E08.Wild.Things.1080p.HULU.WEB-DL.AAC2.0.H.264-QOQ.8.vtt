Pass it to Anna.

00:13.569 --> 00:14.780
Pass it to Anna.

00:19.247 --> 00:20.415
Pass it to Anna.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.211
Anna?

00:26.804 --> 00:28.766
Oh, my God, you always get a note.

00:28.849 --> 00:29.849
Shut up!

00:31.647 --> 00:32.983
<i>Yo, wassup!</i>

00:37.241 --> 00:38.953
<i>Tight. B.</i>

00:40.414 --> 00:43.504
Oh, my God! You have to go.

00:45.967 --> 00:47.469
That's how it happens, Anna.

00:47.679 --> 00:50.058
Mm. What happens?

00:51.770 --> 00:52.897
Maya.

00:54.943 --> 00:55.987
All right.

00:56.070 --> 00:57.657
Page 1. Section A.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.454
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa...
- <i>¡Silencio! ¡Silencio!</i>

01:00.663 --> 01:02.207
I'm serious. Stop!

01:04.003 --> 01:05.840
All right. We've got a lot to get to.
Come on.

01:06.090 --> 01:07.134
One. Two.

01:07.343 --> 01:08.846
Can I go to the bathroom?

01:11.017 --> 01:12.311
I'll hold it.

01:13.063 --> 01:14.148
You know what?

01:14.440 --> 01:16.402
Actually, need to go really bad.

I don't know yet.

01:44.125 --> 01:46.212
Oh, my God, 'Na,
I feel like everyone's staring...

01:46.295 --> 01:47.632
No, they are not.

01:47.715 --> 01:48.968
They are already hooking up.

01:49.051 --> 01:50.053
That's her friend Maya.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.616
Oh, my God, they're talking about us.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.059
We're on top.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.331

- Oh, hey.

02:01.743 --> 02:03.956
So, are you... are you
coming tomorrow night?

02:04.749 --> 02:07.296
Um, I think so.

02:07.589 --> 02:08.924
What's the movie about?

02:09.008 --> 02:11.053
It's about hairless wild snatch.

02:11.137 --> 02:12.640
Ew!

02:12.724 --> 02:14.143
What?

02:14.226 --> 02:16.982
I actually saw it in the theaters,
and I jizzled all over the place.

02:17.065 --> 02:18.903
Really? Shut up!

02:20.363 --> 02:21.700
So, are you in?

02:22.242 --> 02:25.583
Um, OK. Well, can Maya come?

02:25.666 --> 02:27.085
No, like I don't care.

02:27.796 --> 02:29.048
Uh, yeah. Sure.

02:31.177 --> 02:32.847
- Cool.
- Hi.

02:32.931 --> 02:34.075
- Cool. We'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

02:34.099 --> 02:35.393
- Bye!
- Bye.

- You don't wanna do it, Na?

03:05.120 --> 03:07.542
What if Brendan wants to kiss me tomorrow?

03:08.126 --> 03:09.838
I don't know if I want to.

03:09.963 --> 03:11.132
You don't?

03:11.424 --> 03:13.780
He tried last time, and it just felt,
like, really weird and unnatural,

03:13.804 --> 03:16.475
but it's like, "Why?
I'm hot. He's hot." Like...

03:16.560 --> 03:17.729
I think he's gonna.

03:18.146 --> 03:20.693
Maybe it's gonna feel natural on Saturday.

03:20.776 --> 03:22.947
Like, it won't be as weird as that time.

03:23.616 --> 03:24.743
Maybe.

03:24.826 --> 03:26.663
Anna, it's so simple, like...

03:26.830 --> 03:29.376
It's like, this, like...

03:32.049 --> 03:33.569
- I don't know.
- You know what I mean.

03:33.636 --> 03:34.846
Yeah, that looks good.

03:38.102 --> 03:39.731
You have to do tongue.

03:40.691 --> 03:43.071
Kinda small head.

03:56.765 --> 03:58.142
Stop it!

03:58.476 --> 04:01.525
- Hey, Anna, did you...
- Dad! Get out!

04:02.568 --> 04:03.946
Maya! Please, get out!

04:04.029 --> 04:05.783
- No!
- Maya is, like, naked!

04:05.866 --> 04:08.037
- I'm just looking for my Discman.
- Dad, get out!

04:08.121 --> 04:09.206
Get out!

04:14.759 --> 04:17.974
- I don't think I'm gonna go tomorrow.
- Hmm?

04:18.307 --> 04:20.813
- I don't think I wanna go.
- Why?

04:22.065 --> 04:23.944
'Cause I'm not invited.

04:24.111 --> 04:25.447
Yes, you are.

04:26.157 --> 04:27.367
No, I'm not.

04:28.327 --> 04:31.125
You asked.
Brendan didn't actually invite me.

04:31.208 --> 04:33.337
Oh, my God, you always do this.

04:34.381 --> 04:37.680
He just said you're going,
so that means you're invited.

04:37.764 --> 04:40.143
Yeah, but you're gonna be, like,
off making out with him,

04:40.226 --> 04:42.732
and I'm just gonna be, like,
sitting there by myself.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.403
Why don't you find somebody
to go with you?

04:45.487 --> 04:46.740
Like who?

04:47.199 --> 04:51.499
Flymiamibro's like at a computer
conference this weekend in Tucson.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.547
I don't know. You could ask
one of the guys from soccer practice.

04:56.467 --> 04:57.637
Mm.

04:58.722 --> 05:00.141
No.

05:15.673 --> 05:19.263
Maya... just do this thing.

05:38.844 --> 05:40.848
- Did you get anybody?
- No.

05:40.931 --> 05:43.060
Literally, no one will even
look at me, like...

05:43.144 --> 05:45.190
Aw! I'm sure that's not true.

05:45.398 --> 05:46.398
Yeah!

05:48.822 --> 05:50.576
'Na, can you, like, focus?

05:50.659 --> 05:53.289
You're off in Brendan-land waving it up.

05:53.372 --> 05:56.128
Maya, I'm, like, waving at my BF.
Like, just chill.

05:56.588 --> 05:58.132
Whatever.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.804
Why don't you just go ask Sam?

06:01.848 --> 06:02.934
Stop.

06:03.226 --> 06:04.812
- Like...
- No, I don't want to...

06:04.896 --> 06:06.691
Not to, like, hook up. Just to hang with.

06:08.570 --> 06:09.948
Please.

06:14.456 --> 06:16.878
- Go. Come on.
- Fine. Whatever.

06:16.962 --> 06:19.132
- Be nice.
- I am nice.

06:19.968 --> 06:21.596
Hey, turd-hole.

06:21.846 --> 06:23.934
Practicing with all your friends?

06:24.101 --> 06:26.146
Ha-ha-ha. What do you want?

06:26.648 --> 06:29.612
Um, are you going to, uh...

06:30.280 --> 06:32.743
that movie thing or whatever tonight?

06:32.827 --> 06:35.916
- What movie?
<i>- Wild Things.</i> At Brendan's, like...

06:36.000 --> 06:38.045
Yeah. Why?

06:39.214 --> 06:40.843
- Well...
- Oh, my gosh! Wow, Sam!

06:40.926 --> 06:42.513
You're, like, really good at that.

06:43.222 --> 06:45.811
Oh, thanks, Jenna.
It's... it's just dribblin'.

06:46.478 --> 06:50.194
Wait, what? Are you guys serious?

06:50.278 --> 06:51.990
Oh, my God!

06:52.365 --> 06:55.455
Dribbling's in basketball, moron, like...

06:55.914 --> 06:57.167
No.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.129
It's in uh... soccer.

06:59.212 --> 07:01.258
- Dribbling is in soccer, too.
- Yep.

07:01.341 --> 07:03.429
That's what it's called, dribbling.

07:06.060 --> 07:10.193
So, Jenna, a bunch of us are going
to Brendan Tooler's place tonight

07:10.276 --> 07:11.956
to watch <i>Wild Things.</i>
It's going to be fun.

07:11.988 --> 07:13.658
- You should come.
- Um, yeah.

07:13.742 --> 07:15.621
OK. That sounds fun.

07:15.871 --> 07:17.750
Maybe you can show me
some of your moves there.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.754
Well, there is not gonna
be soccer practice,

07:19.837 --> 07:21.966
so that literally makes zero sense.

07:23.385 --> 07:25.891
Um, cool, yeah.

07:26.350 --> 07:27.895
- See you there.
- All right.

07:28.772 --> 07:31.986
OK, I'm sorry,
but she was actually not invited.

07:32.070 --> 07:33.907
I think it's really weird
that she'd show up.

07:34.074 --> 07:35.368
Like, it's psycho, Sam.

07:36.328 --> 07:38.332
I don't know
why you're being such a biatch,

07:38.415 --> 07:39.961
because she's actually pretty nice.

07:43.802 --> 07:45.639
Nice raging, dumbnuts.

07:51.776 --> 07:53.487
I'm freaking nice, too.

07:57.203 --> 07:59.416
And this is the den where we watch movies,

07:59.542 --> 08:01.170
and sometimes, I play video games.

08:01.295 --> 08:03.925
Oh, my God, it's so cool.

08:04.009 --> 08:05.428
- Yeah.
- No, it's not. It's a duck.

08:05.971 --> 08:07.641
Wow thang!

08:08.350 --> 08:09.687
Hmm-mm.

08:10.772 --> 08:12.025
What's up?

08:12.358 --> 08:14.321
- Hey.
- 'Sup! 'Sup! 'Sup!

08:14.822 --> 08:17.285
- JK.
- What's up, Skyler?

08:17.368 --> 08:21.376
Hey. Who's ready for some snacks?

08:21.460 --> 08:22.963
Oh, my gosh.

08:23.214 --> 08:24.800
Hi, Mrs. Tooler.

08:24.884 --> 08:26.345
I'm Anna Kone.

08:26.428 --> 08:29.894
Anna! I've heard so much about you!

08:29.977 --> 08:31.731
I've heard so much about you.

08:31.814 --> 08:34.152
Oh, Anna, you are just adorable.

08:34.277 --> 08:36.323
Brendan, you talk about her all the time,

08:36.406 --> 08:38.536
but you didn't say how adorable she is.

08:38.620 --> 08:39.622
Mom, leave.

08:40.122 --> 08:43.880
- Um, your den is so stunning!
- Yeah.

08:44.089 --> 08:45.466
So polite.

08:45.592 --> 08:46.803
She's a keeper, Brendy.

08:46.886 --> 08:48.406
I'm gonna stick your head
in the oven, Mom,

08:48.430 --> 08:49.430
if you don't shut up.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.478
OK. I can take a hint.

08:53.357 --> 08:55.821
That must be Cousin Richard.
I'll got let him in.

08:55.904 --> 08:57.323
Go.

08:57.783 --> 08:59.579
Your mom is really sweet.

09:00.413 --> 09:01.958
Yeah. Whatever.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:04.755 --> 09:06.383
- Oh, my God.
- Everyone,

09:06.466 --> 09:07.803
this is Cousin Richard.

09:07.886 --> 09:09.306
- You got the movie?
- Yeah.

09:09.557 --> 09:11.184
Used my bro's ID.

09:11.310 --> 09:12.478
They bought it.

09:12.896 --> 09:14.274
Why do you need an ID?

09:14.399 --> 09:16.320
'Cause it's like X-rated I think.

09:16.403 --> 09:17.948
I thought this was about animals.

09:18.032 --> 09:19.660
Well, there are beavers, you know.

09:20.787 --> 09:23.793
Oh, my God, Sam! You're, like, so funny.

09:24.503 --> 09:26.507
So let's get the party started.

09:27.383 --> 09:31.433
Ladies and germs,
tonight's feature film stars Matt Dillon,

09:31.517 --> 09:34.523
Kevin Bacon, Denise Richards,
Denise Richards' blammos,

09:34.690 --> 09:36.360
and Neve Campbell.

09:36.694 --> 09:40.661
It is rated "R" for adult language
and sexual situations.

09:40.744 --> 09:42.413
- Yes!
- Let's go.

09:42.497 --> 09:43.541
Yeah.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.631
With a runtime of 108 minutes
including credits,

09:46.714 --> 09:50.429
which you wanna stick around for,
I give you <i>Wild Things.</i>

09:50.597 --> 09:52.893
Yeah, this is good.

10:38.275 --> 10:40.237
Switch seats with me.

10:42.450 --> 10:43.578
Why?

10:43.995 --> 10:45.498
So you'll be closer to...

10:45.582 --> 10:47.126
Shh!

10:50.049 --> 10:52.428
You can sit beside Brendan.

10:52.596 --> 10:53.765
No.

10:53.848 --> 10:55.434
Yes.

11:10.882 --> 11:13.930
<i>So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?</i>

11:15.934 --> 11:17.831
<i>Washing that old Jeep of mine
is sort of waste of time.</i>

11:17.855 --> 11:19.525
<i>- Don't you think?
- Not at all.</i>

11:58.937 --> 12:01.441
Brendan wants to hook up with Anna.

12:07.829 --> 12:09.583
Brendan wants to hook up with you.

12:10.961 --> 12:12.965
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes. He does.

12:13.090 --> 12:15.971
Listen.
Cousin Richard literally just told me.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.374
My God, go! Go follow him.

12:30.457 --> 12:31.627
No! No.

12:31.711 --> 12:33.589
- Go! Go!
- You should go follow him.

12:33.673 --> 12:35.009
Go. It's now or never. Go.

12:36.428 --> 12:37.973
Come with me. Come with me.

12:38.015 --> 12:40.310
- No, let her go.
- I'm letting them go, Jenna.

12:40.394 --> 12:41.856
Jenna, shut up!

12:41.981 --> 12:43.693
- Will you please come with me?
- No.

12:43.818 --> 12:46.364
I'm gonna be there with you in your head
the whole...

12:46.448 --> 12:47.909
Move.

12:48.828 --> 12:49.913
Go!

12:50.540 --> 12:51.584
Bye.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.011
- They're gonna get it all tonight.
- Oh, my God!

12:58.931 --> 13:00.685
Don't try anything, perv.

13:00.810 --> 13:02.396
I'll just move.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.029
Sam, I was kidding.

13:09.077 --> 13:10.496
Is this OK?

13:10.997 --> 13:12.458
Absolutely.

13:49.490 --> 13:50.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:55.712 --> 13:57.047
Just gonna use the bathroom.

13:57.716 --> 13:58.843
OK.

14:07.234 --> 14:09.280
<i>So you got my mom's money.</i>

14:11.075 --> 14:12.244
<i>How much?</i>

15:36.997 --> 15:38.166
Hey.

16:59.537 --> 17:03.169
<i>After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.</i>

17:03.963 --> 17:05.298
<i>After tonight?</i>

17:10.183 --> 17:11.603
Oh, busted.

17:17.865 --> 17:19.285
How was it?

17:20.412 --> 17:21.832
I'll tell you later, OK?

17:21.915 --> 17:22.915
Was it good?

17:22.959 --> 17:25.005
Oh, here it is. Everyone needs to shut up.

17:37.822 --> 17:39.659
<i>God in Heaven.</i>

17:46.130 --> 17:47.675
Are you OK?

17:49.888 --> 17:51.140
What happened?

17:52.476 --> 17:54.898
- 'Na, what's wrong?
- Stop.

18:09.343 --> 18:11.347
And then, like, were your lips
close together

18:11.472 --> 18:13.977
when you guys were standing
close together?

18:14.729 --> 18:17.902
Yeah... and then they touched.

18:18.862 --> 18:20.323
They did.

18:20.783 --> 18:23.622
- That's, like, romantic.
- No, it wasn't.

18:24.749 --> 18:27.964
- Yo, it literally wasn't at all.
- Why?

18:30.051 --> 18:33.349
He puts his lips, like,
all the way around mine...

18:34.853 --> 18:38.359
- Ew!
- And, like, sucked.

18:39.863 --> 18:42.952
- What?
- It's not funny.

18:43.119 --> 18:46.417
Wait. And then what? Was that it?
Like, he just sucked?

18:46.543 --> 18:49.507
No, and then he put his tongue
in my mouth, and he, like...

18:50.008 --> 18:54.809
did like a torpedo cat tongue,
and, like, drilled my mouth.

18:54.893 --> 18:55.936
What was it like?

18:56.061 --> 18:58.024
- What did he do with it?
- Like this.

18:58.149 --> 19:00.738
- Ew! Ew! Stop!
- Yeah.

19:00.821 --> 19:02.491
I can't. I wish I could.

19:02.533 --> 19:05.473
What did you do with your tongue?
Did you do it back or did you just, like...

19:05.497 --> 19:09.547
It was, like, pinned back,
like, it was in trouble, you know.

19:10.006 --> 19:13.806
- That's crazy.
- I know.

19:14.974 --> 19:16.310
It was awful.

19:16.937 --> 19:18.649
I'm sorry.

19:19.651 --> 19:23.074
Well, at least you just, like,
had your first kiss, you know.

19:23.157 --> 19:25.161
I wish that I hadn't.

19:25.663 --> 19:28.334
- Don't say that.
- I really do.

19:30.421 --> 19:33.679
Everything is just different now,
and I just have to breakup with him, so...

19:33.762 --> 19:35.933
Really?

19:36.016 --> 19:37.352
Yeah.

19:38.564 --> 19:42.195
He's not the Brendan that bought us snacks
at the bowling alley, you know.

19:42.279 --> 19:43.279
Mm-hmm.

19:43.657 --> 19:46.955
He's like the Brendan that drilled
the back of my throat with his tongue.

19:48.416 --> 19:52.173
So... it's up to you
to get the next boyfriend.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.136
Why?

19:56.766 --> 19:57.852
What about Cousin Richard?

19:59.313 --> 20:02.904
- Do you like him?
- No, I don't. It's not him.

20:03.446 --> 20:05.241
Oh, it's someone?

20:05.910 --> 20:07.788
Is it Sam?

20:08.080 --> 20:09.542
No.

20:11.337 --> 20:12.924
No. Let's just go to bed.

20:12.965 --> 20:14.134
- Wait, look at me...
- What?

20:14.217 --> 20:15.930
And let me ask you again. Is it Sam?

20:16.055 --> 20:18.476
- Is what Sam?
- Do you like Sam?

20:18.602 --> 20:19.812
Mm-mm.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.319
Mm-mm.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.799
Hey, butt-rat!

20:33.924 --> 20:35.468
Hey, Maya.

20:36.972 --> 20:42.023
What the hell? You're, like, being weird.
I'm mad at you.

20:42.608 --> 20:46.281
- OK.
- Seriously?

20:46.365 --> 20:50.498
I normally say things to you,
and then you say, like, mean things back.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.503
Mm. Sorr...

20:53.212 --> 20:55.634
God, you're just, like, being so lame.

20:55.759 --> 20:59.349
It's like ever since you started dating
whatever her fricking name is,

20:59.474 --> 21:01.154
- you're just being...
- Her name is Jenna.

21:02.188 --> 21:04.527
Maybe if you try to be nicer to me
once in a while.

21:04.652 --> 21:06.531
- I'm nice.
- Oh, yeah?

21:06.614 --> 21:08.869
So how about you say
something nice right now?

21:09.996 --> 21:12.125
- Like, right now?
- Yeah.

21:15.214 --> 21:17.302
Argh! OK, like...

21:20.475 --> 21:24.399
You're, like, less dandruffy
in carpool this year.

21:25.276 --> 21:26.613
Oh, my God.

21:26.863 --> 21:28.909
OK, I'm sorry. OK.

21:29.034 --> 21:31.038
You...

21:31.664 --> 21:33.125
OK, you're...

21:38.219 --> 21:41.559
you're, like, the funniest person
in our entire grade.

21:45.024 --> 21:48.155
- Not bad.
- Yeah?

21:49.575 --> 21:52.413
Do you have something nice
to say about me?

21:54.042 --> 21:56.255
- Yeah.
- If you want.

21:57.716 --> 22:00.806
Well, you do a really good <i>Ace Ventura.</i>

22:02.726 --> 22:03.854
And?

22:05.983 --> 22:07.570
And um...

22:08.905 --> 22:12.580
you are a awesome friend.

22:16.796 --> 22:17.882
That's it?

22:24.352 --> 22:26.315
- Hey, Maya. Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

22:26.398 --> 22:28.612
Walk me to class?

22:28.695 --> 22:31.743
Um, sure. See you later, Maya.

22:31.910 --> 22:33.495
Whatever.

22:34.206 --> 22:36.753
You've... left your locker open.

22:40.761 --> 22:43.349
<i>- OK. So, can I read this to you?
- Yeah.</i>

22:43.432 --> 22:45.979
OK. "Dear Brendan, wassup!

22:46.104 --> 22:50.112
This is Anna Kone. We've been
boyfriend-girlfriend for three weeks now,

22:50.238 --> 22:52.367
which is the longest relationship
I've ever been in.

22:52.450 --> 22:55.791
I've been doing a lot of thinking
since we kissed last night at <i>Wild Things.</i>

22:55.874 --> 22:57.771
This is hard, but I don't think
you're the one for me.

22:57.795 --> 23:00.067
So I'm breaking up with you.
I hope we can still be friends.

23:00.091 --> 23:01.678
See you in band. Anna Kone."

23:02.470 --> 23:04.224
That's really good.

23:04.307 --> 23:06.997
Should I mention about the kiss
that it was bad that he needs to work on?

23:07.021 --> 23:09.401
No, I don't think so. That's mean.

23:09.484 --> 23:10.862
- Right.
- Yeah.

23:10.946 --> 23:12.407
Will you give it to him for me?

23:12.950 --> 23:14.244
Yeah. I will.

23:19.672 --> 23:21.133
Shh!

23:27.103 --> 23:28.147
It's Becca.

23:30.318 --> 23:32.030
Do you think she knows?

23:33.032 --> 23:34.200
Hmm.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.545
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

23:39.670 --> 23:41.107
You need to get that to him
before she does.

23:41.131 --> 23:43.553
- OK. I can give...
- Run fast. Go! Go!

23:48.897 --> 23:52.028
Excuse me. Have you seen
Brendan Tooler? Skyler? No?

23:52.320 --> 23:54.825
Have you seen Brendan or Skyler? Brendan?

23:55.368 --> 23:58.082
Have you seen Brendan or Skyler?
None of you!

24:06.390 --> 24:08.185
Phew!

24:10.607 --> 24:13.445
- Hey, Kone,
- Hey, Becca.

24:15.199 --> 24:17.036
Oh, my God.

24:21.002 --> 24:22.130
<i>Dear Anna,</i>

24:23.173 --> 24:25.512
<i>I don't think it's a good idea
that we go out anymore.</i>

24:25.971 --> 24:28.560
<i>I'm breaking up with you. Brendan.</i>

24:39.372 --> 24:43.882
I couldn't find Brendan
or Skyler anywhere,

24:43.965 --> 24:45.719
- so I can't reach...
- It's OK.

24:45.844 --> 24:47.681
It's OK. We got broken up with.

24:47.973 --> 24:50.394
- Oh, my God, no.
- Yeah.

24:50.896 --> 24:53.610
- I'm sorry.
- It's whatever, like...

24:53.902 --> 24:56.406
I should've been faster. I'm sorry.

24:57.659 --> 25:00.164
- I'm an idiot.
- No. I am.

25:05.926 --> 25:08.388
It's OK.

25:11.228 --> 25:15.069
Your beady stupid little eyes,
your fat nose.

25:20.246 --> 25:23.418
I play your stupid saxophone like that,
asshole.

25:26.341 --> 25:27.594
What?

25:29.013 --> 25:32.311
Your mom said she overheard some stuff
in carpool about you and Braydan.

25:33.146 --> 25:35.902
That's not his name,
and I don't wanna talk about it.

25:37.321 --> 25:41.329
You really shouldn't hold things inside.

25:44.753 --> 25:47.676
Are you guys serious?
What do you want me to say right now?

25:48.385 --> 25:50.640
Do you want me to tell you
that I got dumped?

25:50.932 --> 25:53.980
It's embarrassing.
That's what's happened, so...

25:54.063 --> 25:56.777
- You're so much cuter than he is.
- Totally.

25:57.320 --> 26:00.409
You're gonna have so many boyfriends
in your life...

26:00.492 --> 26:01.704
- Totally.
- Before you

26:01.829 --> 26:03.498
find the one you wanna be with.

26:03.583 --> 26:04.835
I guess, yeah.

26:05.545 --> 26:08.050
But... but look...

26:08.843 --> 26:13.226
this is it. This is... This is love.

26:14.312 --> 26:16.692
And you didn't have that with Brendan.

26:17.151 --> 26:19.698
I know I didn't, and I still kissed him.

26:19.823 --> 26:21.661
- Well, you had your first kiss.
- Oh!

26:24.290 --> 26:27.463
We had and I wish I didn't.
It was disgusting.

26:29.092 --> 26:34.895
You know... life is...
it's about experiences,

26:34.978 --> 26:37.943
and someone else will come along.

26:38.318 --> 26:42.994
Kissing definitely gets better. Right?

26:43.245 --> 26:44.748
Yeah.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.177
What is wrong with you guys?

26:51.595 --> 26:53.390
See. It gets better...

26:53.516 --> 26:57.231
- OK. Oh, my God!
- And better...

26:57.983 --> 26:59.903
and better.

27:25.747 --> 27:28.168
Ooh!

27:30.590 --> 27:36.309
Ooh!

27:37.269 --> 27:41.152
Ooh!

27:41.277 --> 27:45.954
Ooh, ooh!
