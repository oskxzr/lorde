1
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:13,441
Pass it to Anna.

2
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:15,780
Pass it to Anna.

3
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:21,415
Pass it to Anna.

4
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,211
Anna?

5
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:29,766
Oh, my God, you always get a note.

6
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:30,810
Shut up!

7
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:33,983
<i>Yo, wassup!</i>

8
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,953
<i>Tight. B.</i>

9
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:44,504
Oh, my God! You have to go.

10
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,469
That's how it happens, Anna.

11
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,058
Mm. What happens?

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,897
Maya.

13
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:56,987
All right.

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,657
Page 1. Section A.

15
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:01,454
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa...
- <i>¡Silencio! ¡Silencio!</i>

16
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:03,207
I'm serious. Stop!

17
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,840
All right. We've got a lot to get to.
Come on.

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,134
One. Two.

19
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:09,846
Can I go to the bathroom?

20
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:13,311
I'll hold it.

21
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:15,148
You know what?

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,402
Actually, need to go really bad.

23
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,868
Stop, Maya.

24
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:43,831
We're going.

25
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:45,041
I don't know yet.

26
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,212
Oh, my God, 'Na,
I feel like everyone's staring...

27
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:48,632
No, they are not.

28
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:49,968
They are already hooking up.

29
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:51,053
That's her friend Maya.

30
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,557
Oh, my God, they're talking about us.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,059
We're on top.

32
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,272
- Shh! He's right there. He's right there.
- No, he's...

33
00:01:56,355 --> 00:01:57,399
He's right there.
Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop!

34
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,153
I'm serious. Please, stop. Please.

35
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:00,405
Don't look.

36
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,618
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

37
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:04,956
So, are you... are you
coming tomorrow night?

38
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:08,296
Um, I think so.

39
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:09,924
What's the movie about?

40
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,053
It's about hairless wild snatch.

41
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:13,640
Ew!

42
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:15,143
What?

43
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:17,982
I actually saw it in the theaters,
and I jizzled all over the place.

44
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:19,903
Really? Shut up!

45
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:22,700
So, are you in?

46
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:26,583
Um, OK. Well, can Maya come?

47
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,085
No, like I don't care.

48
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:30,048
Uh, yeah. Sure.

49
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:33,847
- Cool.
- Hi.

50
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:34,974
- Cool. We'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

51
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,393
- Bye!
- Bye.

52
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:40,068

- What? Keep going.
- You don't wanna do it, Na?

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,542
What if Brendan wants to kiss me tomorrow?

63
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,838
I don't know if I want to.

64
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:12,132
You don't?

65
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:14,721
He tried last time, and it just felt,
like, really weird and unnatural,

66
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:17,475
but it's like, "Why?
I'm hot. He's hot." Like...

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,729
I think he's gonna.

68
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:21,693
Maybe it's gonna feel natural on Saturday.

69
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:23,947
Like, it won't be as weird as that time.

70
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:25,743
Maybe.

71
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:27,663
Anna, it's so simple, like...

72
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,376
It's like, this, like...

73
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,552
- I don't know.
- You know what I mean.

74
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:35,846
Yeah, that looks good.

75
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,731
You have to do tongue.

76
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:44,071
Kinda small head.

77
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:59,142
Stop it!

78
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:02,525
- Hey, Anna, did you...
- Dad! Get out!

79
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:04,946
Maya! Please, get out!

80
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,783
- No!
- Maya is, like, naked!

81
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:09,037
- I'm just looking for my Discman.
- Dad, get out!

82
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:10,206
Get out!

83
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,974
- I don't think I'm gonna go tomorrow.
- Hmm?

84
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:21,813
- I don't think I wanna go.
- Why?

85
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:24,944
'Cause I'm not invited.

86
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,447
Yes, you are.

87
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:28,367
No, I'm not.

88
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:32,125
You asked.
Brendan didn't actually invite me.

89
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,337
Oh, my God, you always do this.

90
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:38,680
He just said you're going,
so that means you're invited.

91
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:41,143
Yeah, but you're gonna be, like,
off making out with him,

92
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:43,732
and I'm just gonna be, like,
sitting there by myself.

93
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,403
Why don't you find somebody
to go with you?

94
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,740
Like who?

95
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,499
Flymiamibro's like at a computer
conference this weekend in Tucson.

96
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,547
I don't know. You could ask
one of the guys from soccer practice.

97
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:58,637
Mm.

98
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:01,141
No.

99
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:20,263
Maya... just do this thing.

100
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:41,848
- Did you get anybody?
- No.

101
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:44,060
Literally, no one will even
look at me, like...

102
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,190
Aw! I'm sure that's not true.

103
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:47,358
Yeah!

104
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,576
'Na, can you, like, focus?

105
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,289
You're off in Brendan-land waving it up.

106
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:57,128
Maya, I'm, like, waving at my BF.
Like, just chill.

107
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,132
Whatever.

108
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,804
Why don't you just go ask Sam?

109
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:03,934
Stop.

110
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:05,812
- Like...
- No, I don't want to...

111
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:07,691
Not to, like, hook up. Just to hang with.

112
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,948
Please.

113
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:17,878
- Go. Come on.
- Fine. Whatever.

114
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,132
- Be nice.
- I am nice.

115
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:22,596
Hey, turd-hole.

116
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,934
Practicing with all your friends?

117
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,146
Ha-ha-ha. What do you want?

118
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:30,612
Um, are you going to, uh...

119
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,743
that movie thing or whatever tonight?

120
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,916
- What movie?
<i>- Wild Things.</i> At Brendan's, like...

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,045
Yeah. Why?

122
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:41,843
- Well...
- Oh, my gosh! Wow, Sam!

123
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:43,513
You're, like, really good at that.

124
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:46,811
Oh, thanks, Jenna.
It's... it's just dribblin'.

125
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:51,194
Wait, what? Are you guys serious?

126
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,990
Oh, my God!

127
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:56,455
Dribbling's in basketball, moron, like...

128
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:58,167
No.

129
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,129
It's in uh... soccer.

130
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,258
- Dribbling is in soccer, too.
- Yep.

131
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:04,429
That's what it's called, dribbling.

132
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,193
So, Jenna, a bunch of us are going
to Brendan Tooler's place tonight

133
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:12,905
to watch <i>Wild Things.</i>
It's going to be fun.

134
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:14,658
- You should come.
- Um, yeah.

135
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:16,621
OK. That sounds fun.

136
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,750
Maybe you can show me
some of your moves there.

137
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,754
Well, there is not gonna
be soccer practice,

138
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:22,966
so that literally makes zero sense.

139
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:26,891
Um, cool, yeah.

140
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,895
- See you there.
- All right.

141
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:32,986
OK, I'm sorry,
but she was actually not invited.

142
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,907
I think it's really weird
that she'd show up.

143
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:36,368
Like, it's psycho, Sam.

144
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:39,332
I don't know
why you're being such a biatch,

145
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,961
because she's actually pretty nice.

146
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:46,639
Nice raging, dumbnuts.

147
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:55,034
I'm freaking nice, too.

148
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:00,416
And this is the den where we watch movies,

149
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,170
and sometimes, I play video games.

150
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:04,925
Oh, my God, it's so cool.

151
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,428
- Yeah.
- No, it's not. It's a duck.

152
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:08,641
Wow thang!

153
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,687
Hmm-mm.

154
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:13,025
What's up?

155
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:15,321
- Hey.
- 'Sup! 'Sup! 'Sup!

156
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:18,285
- JK.
- What's up, Skyler?

157
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:22,376
Hey. Who's ready for some snacks?

158
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,963
Oh, my gosh.

159
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:25,800
Hi, Mrs. Tooler.

160
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,345
I'm Anna Kone.

161
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:30,894
Anna! I've heard so much about you!

162
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,731
I've heard so much about you.

163
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:35,152
Oh, Anna, you are just adorable.

164
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,323
Brendan, you talk about her all the time,

165
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:39,536
but you didn't say how adorable she is.

166
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,622
Mom, leave.

167
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:44,880
- Um, your den is so stunning!
- Yeah.

168
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,466
So polite.

169
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,803
She's a keeper, Brendy.

170
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:49,347
I'm gonna stick your head
in the oven, Mom,

171
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,266
if you don't shut up.

172
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,478
OK. I can take a hint.

173
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:56,821
That must be Cousin Richard.
I'll got let him in.

174
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,323
Go.

175
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:00,579
Your mom is really sweet.

176
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:02,958
Yeah. Whatever.

177
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,379
- Hey.
- Hey.

178
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:07,383
- Oh, my God.
- Everyone,

179
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:08,803
this is Cousin Richard.

180
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:10,306
- You got the movie?
- Yeah.

181
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:12,184
Used my bro's ID.

182
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,478
They bought it.

183
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:15,274
Why do you need an ID?

184
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,320
'Cause it's like X-rated I think.

185
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:18,948
I thought this was about animals.

186
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:20,660
Well, there are beavers, you know.

187
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:24,793
Oh, my God, Sam! You're, like, so funny.

188
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,507
So let's get the party started.

189
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:32,433
Ladies and germs,
tonight's feature film stars Matt Dillon,

190
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:35,523
Kevin Bacon, Denise Richards,
Denise Richards' blammos,

191
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,360
and Neve Campbell.

192
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:41,661
It is rated "R" for adult language
and sexual situations.

193
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:43,413
- Yes!
- Let's go.

194
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:44,541
Yeah.

195
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,631
With a runtime of 108 minutes
including credits,

196
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:51,429
which you wanna stick around for,
I give you <i>Wild Things.</i>

197
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:53,893
Yeah, this is good.

198
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,237
Switch seats with me.

199
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,578
Why?

200
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,498
So you'll be closer to...

201
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:48,126
Shh!

202
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,428
You can sit beside Brendan.

203
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:54,765
No.

204
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:56,434
Yes.

205
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:14,930
<i>So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?</i>

206
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:18,771
<i>Washing that old Jeep of mine
is sort of waste of time.</i>

207
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:20,525
<i>- Don't you think?
- Not at all.</i>

208
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:02,441
Brendan wants to hook up with Anna.

209
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,583
Brendan wants to hook up with you.

210
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:13,965
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes. He does.

211
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,971
Listen.
Cousin Richard literally just told me.

212
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,374
My God, go! Go follow him.

213
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:32,627
No! No.

214
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,589
- Go! Go!
- You should go follow him.

215
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:36,009
Go. It's now or never. Go.

216
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:38,973
Come with me. Come with me.

217
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:41,310
- No, let her go.
- I'm letting them go, Jenna.

218
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,856
Jenna, shut up!

219
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:44,693
- Will you please come with me?
- No.

220
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:47,364
I'm gonna be there with you in your head
the whole...

221
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:48,909
Move.

222
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:50,913
Go!

223
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,584
Bye.

224
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,011
- They're gonna get it all tonight.
- Oh, my God!

225
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:01,685
Don't try anything, perv.

226
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,396
I'll just move.

227
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,029
Sam, I was kidding.

228
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:11,496
Is this OK?

229
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,458
Absolutely.

230
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,660
- Hey.
- Hey.

231
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,047
Just gonna use the bathroom.

232
00:13:58,716 --> 00:13:59,843
OK.

233
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:10,280
<i>So you got my mom's money.</i>

234
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:13,244
<i>How much?</i>

235
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:39,166
Hey.

236
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:04,169
<i>After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.</i>

237
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:06,298
<i>After tonight?</i>

238
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:12,603
Oh, busted.

239
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:20,285
How was it?

240
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:22,832
I'll tell you later, OK?

241
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:23,875
Was it good?

242
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,005
Oh, here it is. Everyone needs to shut up.

243
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,659
<i>God in Heaven.</i>

244
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,675
Are you OK?

245
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:52,140
What happened?

246
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,898
- 'Na, what's wrong?
- Stop.

247
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:12,347
And then, like, were your lips
close together

248
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:14,977
when you guys were standing
close together?

249
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:18,902
Yeah... and then they touched.

250
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:21,323
They did.

251
00:18:21,783 --> 00:18:24,622
- That's, like, romantic.
- No, it wasn't.

252
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:28,964
- Yo, it literally wasn't at all.
- Why?

253
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,349
He puts his lips, like,
all the way around mine...

254
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:39,359
- Ew!
- ...and, like, sucked.

255
00:18:40,863 --> 00:18:43,952
- What?
- It's not funny.

256
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,417
Wait. And then what? Was that it?
Like, he just sucked?

257
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,507
No, and then he put his tongue
in my mouth, and he, like...

258
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:55,809
did like a torpedo cat tongue,
and, like, drilled my mouth.

259
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:56,936
What was it like?

260
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,024
- What did he do with it?
- Like this.

261
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:01,738
- Ew! Ew! Stop!
- Yeah.

262
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,491
I can't. I wish I could.

263
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:06,371
What did you do with your tongue?
Did you do it back or did you just, like...

264
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:10,547
It was, like, pinned back,
like, it was in trouble, you know.

265
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:14,806
- That's crazy.
- I know.

266
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:17,310
It was awful.

267
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:19,649
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:24,074
Well, at least you just, like,
had your first kiss, you know.

269
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:26,161
I wish that I hadn't.

270
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:29,334
- Don't say that.
- I really do.

271
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:34,679
Everything is just different now,
and I just have to breakup with him, so...

272
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:36,933
Really?

273
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:38,352
Yeah.

274
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:43,195
He's not the Brendan that bought us snacks
at the bowling alley, you know.

275
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,239
Mm-hmm.

276
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:47,955
He's like the Brendan that drilled
the back of my throat with his tongue.

277
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:53,173
So... it's up to you
to get the next boyfriend.

278
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:55,136
Why?

279
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:58,852
What about Cousin Richard?

280
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:03,904
- Do you like him?
- No, I don't. It's not him.

281
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:06,241
Oh, it's someone?

282
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,788
Is it Sam?

283
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,542
No.

284
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,924
No. Let's just go to bed.

285
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:15,134
- Wait, look at me...
- What?

286
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:16,930
...and let me ask you again. Is it Sam?

287
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:19,476
- Is what Sam?
- Do you like Sam?

288
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:20,812
Mm-mm.

289
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,319
Mm-mm.

290
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,799
Hey, butt-rat!

291
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:36,468
Hey, Maya.

292
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:43,023
What the hell? You're, like, being weird.
I'm mad at you.

293
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:47,281
- OK.
- Seriously?

294
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:51,498
I normally say things to you,
and then you say, like, mean things back.

295
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:53,503
Mm. Sorr...

296
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,634
God, you're just, like, being so lame.

297
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,349
It's like ever since you started dating
whatever her fricking name is,

298
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:01,686
- you're just being...
- Her name is Jenna.

299
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,527
Maybe if you try to be nicer to me
once in a while.

300
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:07,531
- I'm nice.
- Oh, yeah?

301
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,869
So how about you say
something nice right now?

302
00:21:10,996 --> 00:21:13,125
- Like, right now?
- Yeah.

303
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:18,302
Argh! OK, like...

304
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:25,399
You're, like, less dandruffy
in carpool this year.

305
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:27,613
Oh, my God.

306
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,909
OK, I'm sorry. OK.

307
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:32,038
You...

308
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:34,125
OK, you're...

309
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:42,559
you're, like, the funniest person
in our entire grade.

310
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:49,155
- Not bad.
- Yeah?

311
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,413
Do you have something nice
to say about me?

312
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:57,255
- Yeah.
- If you want.

313
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:01,806
Well, you do a really good <i>Ace Ventura.</i>

314
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:04,854
And?

315
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:08,570
And um...

316
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:13,580
you are a awesome friend.

317
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:18,882
That's it?

318
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:27,315
- Hey, Maya. Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

319
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:29,612
Walk me to class?

320
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:32,743
Um, sure. See you later, Maya.

321
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,495
Whatever.

322
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,753
You've... left your locker open.

323
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:44,349
<i>- OK. So, can I read this to you?
- Yeah.</i>

324
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:46,979
OK. "Dear Brendan, wassup!

325
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:51,112
This is Anna Kone. We've been
boyfriend-girlfriend for three weeks now,

326
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:53,367
which is the longest relationship
I've ever been in.

327
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,791
I've been doing a lot of thinking
since we kissed last night at <i>Wild Things.</i>

328
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,670
This is hard, but I don't think
you're the one for me.

329
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,966
So I'm breaking up with you.
I hope we can still be friends.

330
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:02,678
See you in band. Anna Kone."

331
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,224
That's really good.

332
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:07,938
Should I mention about the kiss
that it was bad that he needs to work on?

333
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:10,401
No, I don't think so. That's mean.

334
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:11,862
- Right.
- Yeah.

335
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:13,407
Will you give it to him for me?

336
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,244
Yeah. I will.

337
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:22,914
Shh!

338
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:29,693
It's Becca.

339
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,420
Do you think she knows?

340
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:35,746
Hmm.

341
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,545
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

342
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,006
You need to get that to him
before she does.

343
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:44,553
- OK. I can give...
- Run fast. Go! Go!

344
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:53,028
Excuse me. Have you seen
Brendan Tooler? Skyler? No?

345
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,825
Have you seen Brendan or Skyler? Brendan?

346
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,082
Have you seen Brendan or Skyler?
None of you!

347
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,341
Phew!

348
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:14,445
- Hey, Kone,
- Hey, Becca.

349
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,036
Oh, my God.

350
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,130
<i>Dear Anna,</i>

351
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:26,512
<i>I don't think it's a good idea
that we go out anymore.</i>

352
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:29,716
<i>I'm breaking up with you. Brendan.</i>

353
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:44,882
I couldn't find Brendan
or Skyler anywhere,

354
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:46,719
- so I can't reach...
- It's OK.

355
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:48,681
It's OK. We got broken up with.

356
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:51,394
- Oh, my God, no.
- Yeah.

357
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,610
- I'm sorry.
- It's whatever, like...

358
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:57,406
I should've been faster. I'm sorry.

359
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:01,164
- I'm an idiot.
- No. I am.

360
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:09,388
It's OK.

361
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:16,069
Your beady stupid little eyes,
your fat nose.

362
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:24,418
I play your stupid saxophone like that,
asshole.

363
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:28,984
What?

364
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:33,311
Your mom said she overheard some stuff
in carpool about you and Braydan.

365
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:36,902
That's not his name,
and I don't wanna talk about it.

366
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,797
You really shouldn't hold things inside.

367
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:48,776
Are you guys serious?
What do you want me to say right now?

368
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:51,740
Do you want me to tell you
that I got dumped?

369
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:55,080
It's embarrassing.
That's what's happened, so...

370
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:57,877
- You're so much cuter than he is.
- Totally.

371
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,509
You're gonna have so many boyfriends
in your life...

372
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:02,804
- Totally.
- ...before you

373
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,598
find the one you wanna be with.

374
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:05,935
I guess, yeah.

375
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:09,150
But... but look...

376
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:14,326
this is it. This is... This is love.

377
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:17,792
And you didn't have that with Brendan.

378
00:26:18,251 --> 00:26:20,798
I know I didn't, and I still kissed him.

379
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,761
- Well, you had your first kiss.
- Oh!

380
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,563
We had and I wish I didn't.
It was disgusting.

381
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:35,995
You know... life is...
it's about experiences,

382
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:39,043
and someone else will come along.

383
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:44,094
Kissing definitely gets better. Right?

384
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:45,848
Yeah.

385
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,277
What is wrong with you guys?

386
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,490
See. It gets better...

387
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:58,409
- OK. Oh, my God!
- ...and better...

388
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,471
and better.
