00:12.231 --> 00:13.441
Pass it to Anna.

00:14.569 --> 00:15.780
Pass it to Anna.

00:20.247 --> 00:21.415
Pass it to Anna.

00:22.125 --> 00:23.211
Anna?

00:27.804 --> 00:29.766
Oh, my God, you always get a note.

00:29.849 --> 00:30.810
Shut up!

00:32.647 --> 00:33.983
<i>Yo, wassup!</i>

00:38.241 --> 00:39.953
<i>Tight. B.</i>

00:41.414 --> 00:44.504
Oh, my God! You have to go.

00:46.967 --> 00:48.469
That's how it happens, Anna.

00:48.679 --> 00:51.058
Mm. What happens?

00:52.770 --> 00:53.897
Maya.

00:55.943 --> 00:56.987
All right.

00:57.070 --> 00:58.657
Page 1. Section A.

00:58.824 --> 01:01.454
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa...
- <i>¡Silencio! ¡Silencio!</i>

01:01.663 --> 01:03.207
I'm serious. Stop!

01:05.003 --> 01:06.840
All right. We've got a lot to get to.
Come on.

01:07.090 --> 01:08.134
One. Two.

01:08.343 --> 01:09.846
Can I go to the bathroom?

01:12.017 --> 01:13.311
I'll hold it.

01:14.063 --> 01:15.148
You know what?

01:15.440 --> 01:17.402
Actually, need to go really bad.

01:39.989 --> 01:41.868
Stop, Maya.

01:42.411 --> 01:43.831
We're going.

01:43.914 --> 01:45.041
I don't know yet.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.212
Oh, my God, 'Na,
I feel like everyone's staring...

01:47.295 --> 01:48.632
No, they are not.

01:48.715 --> 01:49.968
They are already hooking up.

01:50.051 --> 01:51.053
That's her friend Maya.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.557
Oh, my God, they're talking about us.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.059
We're on top.

01:54.184 --> 01:56.272
- Shh! He's right there. He's right there.
- No, he's...

01:56.355 --> 01:57.399
He's right there.
Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop!

01:57.482 --> 01:59.153
I'm serious. Please, stop. Please.

01:59.236 --> 02:00.405
Don't look.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.618
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

02:02.743 --> 02:04.956
So, are you... are you
coming tomorrow night?

02:05.749 --> 02:08.296
Um, I think so.

02:08.589 --> 02:09.924
What's the movie about?

02:10.008 --> 02:12.053
It's about hairless wild snatch.

02:12.137 --> 02:13.640
Ew!

02:13.724 --> 02:15.143
What?

02:15.226 --> 02:17.982
I actually saw it in the theaters,
and I jizzled all over the place.

02:18.065 --> 02:19.903
Really? Shut up!

02:21.363 --> 02:22.700
So, are you in?

02:23.242 --> 02:26.583
Um, OK. Well, can Maya come?

02:26.666 --> 02:28.085
No, like I don't care.

02:28.796 --> 02:30.048
Uh, yeah. Sure.

02:32.177 --> 02:33.847
- Cool.
- Hi.

02:33.931 --> 02:34.974
- Cool. We'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

02:35.099 --> 02:36.393
- Bye!
- Bye.

02:37.772 --> 02:40.068
Five! Six! Seven! Eight!

- What? Keep going.
- You don't wanna do it, Na?

03:06.120 --> 03:08.542
What if Brendan wants to kiss me tomorrow?

03:09.126 --> 03:10.838
I don't know if I want to.

03:10.963 --> 03:12.132
You don't?

03:12.424 --> 03:14.721
He tried last time, and it just felt,
like, really weird and unnatural,

03:14.804 --> 03:17.475
but it's like, "Why?
I'm hot. He's hot." Like...

03:17.560 --> 03:18.729
I think he's gonna.

03:19.146 --> 03:21.693
Maybe it's gonna feel natural on Saturday.

03:21.776 --> 03:23.947
Like, it won't be as weird as that time.

03:24.616 --> 03:25.743
Maybe.

03:25.826 --> 03:27.663
Anna, it's so simple, like...

03:27.830 --> 03:30.376
It's like, this, like...

03:33.049 --> 03:34.552
- I don't know.
- You know what I mean.

03:34.636 --> 03:35.846
Yeah, that looks good.

03:39.102 --> 03:40.731
You have to do tongue.

03:41.691 --> 03:44.071
Kinda small head.

03:57.765 --> 03:59.142
Stop it!

03:59.476 --> 04:02.525
- Hey, Anna, did you...
- Dad! Get out!

04:03.568 --> 04:04.946
Maya! Please, get out!

04:05.029 --> 04:06.783
- No!
- Maya is, like, naked!

04:06.866 --> 04:09.037
- I'm just looking for my Discman.
- Dad, get out!

04:09.121 --> 04:10.206
Get out!

04:15.759 --> 04:18.974
- I don't think I'm gonna go tomorrow.
- Hmm?

04:19.307 --> 04:21.813
- I don't think I wanna go.
- Why?

04:23.065 --> 04:24.944
'Cause I'm not invited.

04:25.111 --> 04:26.447
Yes, you are.

04:27.157 --> 04:28.367
No, I'm not.

04:29.327 --> 04:32.125
You asked.
Brendan didn't actually invite me.

04:32.208 --> 04:34.337
Oh, my God, you always do this.

04:35.381 --> 04:38.680
He just said you're going,
so that means you're invited.

04:38.764 --> 04:41.143
Yeah, but you're gonna be, like,
off making out with him,

04:41.226 --> 04:43.732
and I'm just gonna be, like,
sitting there by myself.

04:44.316 --> 04:46.403
Why don't you find somebody
to go with you?

04:46.487 --> 04:47.740
Like who?

04:48.199 --> 04:52.499
Flymiamibro's like at a computer
conference this weekend in Tucson.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.547
I don't know. You could ask
one of the guys from soccer practice.

04:57.467 --> 04:58.637
Mm.

04:59.722 --> 05:01.141
No.

05:16.673 --> 05:20.263
Maya... just do this thing.

05:39.844 --> 05:41.848
- Did you get anybody?
- No.

05:41.931 --> 05:44.060
Literally, no one will even
look at me, like...

05:44.144 --> 05:46.190
Aw! I'm sure that's not true.

05:46.398 --> 05:47.358
Yeah!

05:49.822 --> 05:51.576
'Na, can you, like, focus?

05:51.659 --> 05:54.289
You're off in Brendan-land waving it up.

05:54.372 --> 05:57.128
Maya, I'm, like, waving at my BF.
Like, just chill.

05:57.588 --> 05:59.132
Whatever.

06:00.092 --> 06:01.804
Why don't you just go ask Sam?

06:02.848 --> 06:03.934
Stop.

06:04.226 --> 06:05.812
- Like...
- No, I don't want to...

06:05.896 --> 06:07.691
Not to, like, hook up. Just to hang with.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.948
Please.

06:15.456 --> 06:17.878
- Go. Come on.
- Fine. Whatever.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.132
- Be nice.
- I am nice.

06:20.968 --> 06:22.596
Hey, turd-hole.

06:22.846 --> 06:24.934
Practicing with all your friends?

06:25.101 --> 06:27.146
Ha-ha-ha. What do you want?

06:27.648 --> 06:30.612
Um, are you going to, uh...

06:31.280 --> 06:33.743
that movie thing or whatever tonight?

06:33.827 --> 06:36.916
- What movie?
<i>- Wild Things.</i> At Brendan's, like...

06:37.000 --> 06:39.045
Yeah. Why?

06:40.214 --> 06:41.843
- Well...
- Oh, my gosh! Wow, Sam!

06:41.926 --> 06:43.513
You're, like, really good at that.

06:44.222 --> 06:46.811
Oh, thanks, Jenna.
It's... it's just dribblin'.

06:47.478 --> 06:51.194
Wait, what? Are you guys serious?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.990
Oh, my God!

06:53.365 --> 06:56.455
Dribbling's in basketball, moron, like...

06:56.914 --> 06:58.167
No.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.129
It's in uh... soccer.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.258
- Dribbling is in soccer, too.
- Yep.

07:02.341 --> 07:04.429
That's what it's called, dribbling.

07:07.060 --> 07:11.193
So, Jenna, a bunch of us are going
to Brendan Tooler's place tonight

07:11.276 --> 07:12.905
to watch <i>Wild Things.</i>
It's going to be fun.

07:12.988 --> 07:14.658
- You should come.
- Um, yeah.

07:14.742 --> 07:16.621
OK. That sounds fun.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.750
Maybe you can show me
some of your moves there.

07:18.833 --> 07:20.754
Well, there is not gonna
be soccer practice,

07:20.837 --> 07:22.966
so that literally makes zero sense.

07:24.385 --> 07:26.891
Um, cool, yeah.

07:27.350 --> 07:28.895
- See you there.
- All right.

07:29.772 --> 07:32.986
OK, I'm sorry,
but she was actually not invited.

07:33.070 --> 07:34.907
I think it's really weird
that she'd show up.

07:35.074 --> 07:36.368
Like, it's psycho, Sam.

07:37.328 --> 07:39.332
I don't know
why you're being such a biatch,

07:39.415 --> 07:40.961
because she's actually pretty nice.

07:44.802 --> 07:46.639
Nice raging, dumbnuts.

07:53.323 --> 07:55.034
I'm freaking nice, too.

07:58.203 --> 08:00.416
And this is the den where we watch movies,

08:00.542 --> 08:02.170
and sometimes, I play video games.

08:02.295 --> 08:04.925
Oh, my God, it's so cool.

08:05.009 --> 08:06.428
- Yeah.
- No, it's not. It's a duck.

08:06.971 --> 08:08.641
Wow thang!

08:09.350 --> 08:10.687
Hmm-mm.

08:11.772 --> 08:13.025
What's up?

08:13.358 --> 08:15.321
- Hey.
- 'Sup! 'Sup! 'Sup!

08:15.822 --> 08:18.285
- JK.
- What's up, Skyler?

08:18.368 --> 08:22.376
Hey. Who's ready for some snacks?

08:22.460 --> 08:23.963
Oh, my gosh.

08:24.214 --> 08:25.800
Hi, Mrs. Tooler.

08:25.884 --> 08:27.345
I'm Anna Kone.

08:27.428 --> 08:30.894
Anna! I've heard so much about you!

08:30.977 --> 08:32.731
I've heard so much about you.

08:32.814 --> 08:35.152
Oh, Anna, you are just adorable.

08:35.277 --> 08:37.323
Brendan, you talk about her all the time,

08:37.406 --> 08:39.536
but you didn't say how adorable she is.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.622
Mom, leave.

08:41.122 --> 08:44.880
- Um, your den is so stunning!
- Yeah.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.466
So polite.

08:46.592 --> 08:47.803
She's a keeper, Brendy.

08:47.886 --> 08:49.347
I'm gonna stick your head
in the oven, Mom,

08:49.430 --> 08:50.266
if you don't shut up.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.478
OK. I can take a hint.

08:54.357 --> 08:56.821
That must be Cousin Richard.
I'll got let him in.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.323
Go.

08:58.783 --> 09:00.579
Your mom is really sweet.

09:01.413 --> 09:02.958
Yeah. Whatever.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:05.755 --> 09:07.383
- Oh, my God.
- Everyone,

09:07.466 --> 09:08.803
this is Cousin Richard.

09:08.886 --> 09:10.306
- You got the movie?
- Yeah.

09:10.557 --> 09:12.184
Used my bro's ID.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.478
They bought it.

09:13.896 --> 09:15.274
Why do you need an ID?

09:15.399 --> 09:17.320
'Cause it's like X-rated I think.

09:17.403 --> 09:18.948
I thought this was about animals.

09:19.032 --> 09:20.660
Well, there are beavers, you know.

09:21.787 --> 09:24.793
Oh, my God, Sam! You're, like, so funny.

09:25.503 --> 09:27.507
So let's get the party started.

09:28.383 --> 09:32.433
Ladies and germs,
tonight's feature film stars Matt Dillon,

09:32.517 --> 09:35.523
Kevin Bacon, Denise Richards,
Denise Richards' blammos,

09:35.690 --> 09:37.360
and Neve Campbell.

09:37.694 --> 09:41.661
It is rated "R" for adult language
and sexual situations.

09:41.744 --> 09:43.413
- Yes!
- Let's go.

09:43.497 --> 09:44.541
Yeah.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.631
With a runtime of 108 minutes
including credits,

09:47.714 --> 09:51.429
which you wanna stick around for,
I give you <i>Wild Things.</i>

09:51.597 --> 09:53.893
Yeah, this is good.

10:39.275 --> 10:41.237
Switch seats with me.

10:43.450 --> 10:44.578
Why?

10:44.995 --> 10:46.498
So you'll be closer to...

10:46.582 --> 10:48.126
Shh!

10:51.049 --> 10:53.428
You can sit beside Brendan.

10:53.596 --> 10:54.765
No.

10:54.848 --> 10:56.434
Yes.

11:11.882 --> 11:14.930
<i>So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?</i>

11:16.934 --> 11:18.771
<i>Washing that old Jeep of mine
is sort of waste of time.</i>

11:18.855 --> 11:20.525
<i>- Don't you think?
- Not at all.</i>

11:59.937 --> 12:02.441
Brendan wants to hook up with Anna.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.583
Brendan wants to hook up with you.

12:11.961 --> 12:13.965
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes. He does.

12:14.090 --> 12:16.971
Listen.
Cousin Richard literally just told me.

12:29.830 --> 12:31.374
My God, go! Go follow him.

12:31.457 --> 12:32.627
No! No.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.589
- Go! Go!
- You should go follow him.

12:34.673 --> 12:36.009
Go. It's now or never. Go.

12:37.428 --> 12:38.973
Come with me. Come with me.

12:39.015 --> 12:41.310
- No, let her go.
- I'm letting them go, Jenna.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.856
Jenna, shut up!

12:42.981 --> 12:44.693
- Will you please come with me?
- No.

12:44.818 --> 12:47.364
I'm gonna be there with you in your head
the whole...

12:47.448 --> 12:48.909
Move.

12:49.828 --> 12:50.913
Go!

12:51.540 --> 12:52.584
Bye.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.011
- They're gonna get it all tonight.
- Oh, my God!

12:59.931 --> 13:01.685
Don't try anything, perv.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.396
I'll just move.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.029
Sam, I was kidding.

13:10.077 --> 13:11.496
Is this OK?

13:11.997 --> 13:13.458
Absolutely.

13:50.490 --> 13:51.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:56.712 --> 13:58.047
Just gonna use the bathroom.

13:58.716 --> 13:59.843
OK.

14:08.234 --> 14:10.280
<i>So you got my mom's money.</i>

14:12.075 --> 14:13.244
<i>How much?</i>

15:37.997 --> 15:39.166
Hey.

17:00.537 --> 17:04.169
<i>After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.</i>

17:04.963 --> 17:06.298
<i>After tonight?</i>

17:11.183 --> 17:12.603
Oh, busted.

17:18.865 --> 17:20.285
How was it?

17:21.412 --> 17:22.832
I'll tell you later, OK?

17:22.915 --> 17:23.875
Was it good?

17:23.959 --> 17:26.005
Oh, here it is. Everyone needs to shut up.

17:38.822 --> 17:40.659
<i>God in Heaven.</i>

17:47.130 --> 17:48.675
Are you OK?

17:50.888 --> 17:52.140
What happened?

17:53.476 --> 17:55.898
- 'Na, what's wrong?
- Stop.

18:10.343 --> 18:12.347
And then, like, were your lips
close together

18:12.472 --> 18:14.977
when you guys were standing
close together?

18:15.729 --> 18:18.902
Yeah... and then they touched.

18:19.862 --> 18:21.323
They did.

18:21.783 --> 18:24.622
- That's, like, romantic.
- No, it wasn't.

18:25.749 --> 18:28.964
- Yo, it literally wasn't at all.
- Why?

18:31.051 --> 18:34.349
He puts his lips, like,
all the way around mine...

18:35.853 --> 18:39.359
- Ew!
- ...and, like, sucked.

18:40.863 --> 18:43.952
- What?
- It's not funny.

18:44.119 --> 18:47.417
Wait. And then what? Was that it?
Like, he just sucked?

18:47.543 --> 18:50.507
No, and then he put his tongue
in my mouth, and he, like...

18:51.008 --> 18:55.809
did like a torpedo cat tongue,
and, like, drilled my mouth.

18:55.893 --> 18:56.936
What was it like?

18:57.061 --> 18:59.024
- What did he do with it?
- Like this.

18:59.149 --> 19:01.738
- Ew! Ew! Stop!
- Yeah.

19:01.821 --> 19:03.491
I can't. I wish I could.

19:03.533 --> 19:06.371
What did you do with your tongue?
Did you do it back or did you just, like...

19:06.497 --> 19:10.547
It was, like, pinned back,
like, it was in trouble, you know.

19:11.006 --> 19:14.806
- That's crazy.
- I know.

19:15.974 --> 19:17.310
It was awful.

19:17.937 --> 19:19.649
I'm sorry.

19:20.651 --> 19:24.074
Well, at least you just, like,
had your first kiss, you know.

19:24.157 --> 19:26.161
I wish that I hadn't.

19:26.663 --> 19:29.334
- Don't say that.
- I really do.

19:31.421 --> 19:34.679
Everything is just different now,
and I just have to breakup with him, so...

19:34.762 --> 19:36.933
Really?

19:37.016 --> 19:38.352
Yeah.

19:39.564 --> 19:43.195
He's not the Brendan that bought us snacks
at the bowling alley, you know.

19:43.279 --> 19:44.239
Mm-hmm.

19:44.657 --> 19:47.955
He's like the Brendan that drilled
the back of my throat with his tongue.

19:49.416 --> 19:53.173
So... it's up to you
to get the next boyfriend.

19:53.758 --> 19:55.136
Why?

19:57.766 --> 19:58.852
What about Cousin Richard?

20:00.313 --> 20:03.904
- Do you like him?
- No, I don't. It's not him.

20:04.446 --> 20:06.241
Oh, it's someone?

20:06.910 --> 20:08.788
Is it Sam?

20:09.080 --> 20:10.542
No.

20:12.337 --> 20:13.924
No. Let's just go to bed.

20:13.965 --> 20:15.134
- Wait, look at me...
- What?

20:15.217 --> 20:16.930
...and let me ask you again. Is it Sam?

20:17.055 --> 20:19.476
- Is what Sam?
- Do you like Sam?

20:19.602 --> 20:20.812
Mm-mm.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.319
Mm-mm.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.799
Hey, butt-rat!

20:34.924 --> 20:36.468
Hey, Maya.

20:37.972 --> 20:43.023
What the hell? You're, like, being weird.
I'm mad at you.

20:43.608 --> 20:47.281
- OK.
- Seriously?

20:47.365 --> 20:51.498
I normally say things to you,
and then you say, like, mean things back.

20:51.624 --> 20:53.503
Mm. Sorr...

20:54.212 --> 20:56.634
God, you're just, like, being so lame.

20:56.759 --> 21:00.349
It's like ever since you started dating
whatever her fricking name is,

21:00.474 --> 21:01.686
- you're just being...
- Her name is Jenna.

21:03.188 --> 21:05.527
Maybe if you try to be nicer to me
once in a while.

21:05.652 --> 21:07.531
- I'm nice.
- Oh, yeah?

21:07.614 --> 21:09.869
So how about you say
something nice right now?

21:10.996 --> 21:13.125
- Like, right now?
- Yeah.

21:16.214 --> 21:18.302
Argh! OK, like...

21:21.475 --> 21:25.399
You're, like, less dandruffy
in carpool this year.

21:26.276 --> 21:27.613
Oh, my God.

21:27.863 --> 21:29.909
OK, I'm sorry. OK.

21:30.034 --> 21:32.038
You...

21:32.664 --> 21:34.125
OK, you're...

21:39.219 --> 21:42.559
you're, like, the funniest person
in our entire grade.

21:46.024 --> 21:49.155
- Not bad.
- Yeah?

21:50.575 --> 21:53.413
Do you have something nice
to say about me?

21:55.042 --> 21:57.255
- Yeah.
- If you want.

21:58.716 --> 22:01.806
Well, you do a really good <i>Ace Ventura.</i>

22:03.726 --> 22:04.854
And?

22:06.983 --> 22:08.570
And um...

22:09.905 --> 22:13.580
you are a awesome friend.

22:17.796 --> 22:18.882
That's it?

22:25.352 --> 22:27.315
- Hey, Maya. Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

22:27.398 --> 22:29.612
Walk me to class?

22:29.695 --> 22:32.743
Um, sure. See you later, Maya.

22:32.910 --> 22:34.495
Whatever.

22:35.206 --> 22:37.753
You've... left your locker open.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.349
<i>- OK. So, can I read this to you?
- Yeah.</i>

22:44.432 --> 22:46.979
OK. "Dear Brendan, wassup!

22:47.104 --> 22:51.112
This is Anna Kone. We've been
boyfriend-girlfriend for three weeks now,

22:51.238 --> 22:53.367
which is the longest relationship
I've ever been in.

22:53.450 --> 22:56.791
I've been doing a lot of thinking
since we kissed last night at <i>Wild Things.</i>

22:56.874 --> 22:58.670
This is hard, but I don't think
you're the one for me.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.966
So I'm breaking up with you.
I hope we can still be friends.

23:01.091 --> 23:02.678
See you in band. Anna Kone."

23:03.470 --> 23:05.224
That's really good.

23:05.307 --> 23:07.938
Should I mention about the kiss
that it was bad that he needs to work on?

23:08.021 --> 23:10.401
No, I don't think so. That's mean.

23:10.484 --> 23:11.862
- Right.
- Yeah.

23:11.946 --> 23:13.407
Will you give it to him for me?

23:13.950 --> 23:15.244
Yeah. I will.

23:21.453 --> 23:22.914
Shh!

23:28.649 --> 23:29.693
It's Becca.

23:31.708 --> 23:33.420
Do you think she knows?

23:34.578 --> 23:35.746
Hmm.

23:39.417 --> 23:40.545
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

23:40.670 --> 23:42.006
You need to get that to him
before she does.

23:42.131 --> 23:44.553
- OK. I can give...
- Run fast. Go! Go!

23:49.897 --> 23:53.028
Excuse me. Have you seen
Brendan Tooler? Skyler? No?

23:53.320 --> 23:55.825
Have you seen Brendan or Skyler? Brendan?

23:56.368 --> 23:59.082
Have you seen Brendan or Skyler?
None of you!

24:07.546 --> 24:09.341
Phew!

24:11.607 --> 24:14.445
- Hey, Kone,
- Hey, Becca.

24:16.199 --> 24:18.036
Oh, my God.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.130
<i>Dear Anna,</i>

24:24.173 --> 24:26.512
<i>I don't think it's a good idea
that we go out anymore.</i>

24:27.127 --> 24:29.716
<i>I'm breaking up with you. Brendan.</i>

24:40.372 --> 24:44.882
I couldn't find Brendan
or Skyler anywhere,

24:44.965 --> 24:46.719
- so I can't reach...
- It's OK.

24:46.844 --> 24:48.681
It's OK. We got broken up with.

24:48.973 --> 24:51.394
- Oh, my God, no.
- Yeah.

24:51.896 --> 24:54.610
- I'm sorry.
- It's whatever, like...

24:54.902 --> 24:57.406
I should've been faster. I'm sorry.

24:58.659 --> 25:01.164
- I'm an idiot.
- No. I am.

25:06.926 --> 25:09.388
It's OK.

25:12.228 --> 25:16.069
Your beady stupid little eyes,
your fat nose.

25:21.246 --> 25:24.418
I play your stupid saxophone like that,
asshole.

25:27.731 --> 25:28.984
What?

25:30.013 --> 25:33.311
Your mom said she overheard some stuff
in carpool about you and Braydan.

25:34.146 --> 25:36.902
That's not his name,
and I don't wanna talk about it.

25:38.789 --> 25:42.797
You really shouldn't hold things inside.

25:45.853 --> 25:48.776
Are you guys serious?
What do you want me to say right now?

25:49.485 --> 25:51.740
Do you want me to tell you
that I got dumped?

25:52.032 --> 25:55.080
It's embarrassing.
That's what's happened, so...

25:55.163 --> 25:57.877
- You're so much cuter than he is.
- Totally.

25:58.420 --> 26:01.509
You're gonna have so many boyfriends
in your life...

26:01.592 --> 26:02.804
- Totally.
- ...before you

26:02.929 --> 26:04.598
find the one you wanna be with.

26:04.683 --> 26:05.935
I guess, yeah.

26:06.645 --> 26:09.150
But... but look...

26:09.943 --> 26:14.326
this is it. This is... This is love.

26:15.412 --> 26:17.792
And you didn't have that with Brendan.

26:18.251 --> 26:20.798
I know I didn't, and I still kissed him.

26:20.923 --> 26:22.761
- Well, you had your first kiss.
- Oh!

26:25.390 --> 26:28.563
We had and I wish I didn't.
It was disgusting.

26:30.192 --> 26:35.995
You know... life is...
it's about experiences,

26:36.078 --> 26:39.043
and someone else will come along.

26:39.418 --> 26:44.094
Kissing definitely gets better. Right?

26:44.345 --> 26:45.848
Yeah.

26:50.608 --> 26:52.277
What is wrong with you guys?

26:52.695 --> 26:54.490
See. It gets better...

26:54.694 --> 26:58.409
- OK. Oh, my God!
- ...and better...

26:59.551 --> 27:01.471
and better.
