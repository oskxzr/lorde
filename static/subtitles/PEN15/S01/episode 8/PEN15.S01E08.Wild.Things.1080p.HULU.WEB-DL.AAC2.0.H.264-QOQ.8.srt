00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:12,441
Pass it to Anna.

2
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:14,780
Pass it to Anna.

3
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:20,415
Pass it to Anna.

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,211
Anna?

5
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:28,766
Oh, my God, you always get a note.

6
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:29,849
Shut up!

7
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:32,983
<i>Yo, wassup!</i>

8
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:38,953
<i>Tight. B.</i>

9
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:43,504
Oh, my God! You have to go.

10
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,469
That's how it happens, Anna.

11
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,058
Mm. What happens?

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,897
Maya.

13
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:55,987
All right.

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,657
Page 1. Section A.

15
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,454
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa...
- <i>¡Silencio! ¡Silencio!</i>

16
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:02,207
I'm serious. Stop!

17
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:05,840
All right. We've got a lot to get to.
Come on.

18
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,134
One. Two.

19
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:08,846
Can I go to the bathroom?

20
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:12,311
I'll hold it.

21
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:14,148
You know what?

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,402
Actually, need to go really bad.

We're going.

32
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:44,041
I don't know yet.

33
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,212
Oh, my God, 'Na,
I feel like everyone's staring...

34
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:47,632
No, they are not.

35
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:48,968
They are already hooking up.

36
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,053
That's her friend Maya.

37
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:51,616
Oh, my God, they're talking about us.

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,059
We're on top.

39
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:55,331
- Shh! He's right there. He's right there.
- No, he's...

40
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:56,458
He's right there.
Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop!

41
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,153
I'm serious. Please, stop. Please.

42
00:01:58,236 --> 00:01:59,405
Don't look.

43
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:01,618
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

44
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:03,956
So, are you... are you
coming tomorrow night?

45
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,296
Um, I think so.

46
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:08,924
What's the movie about?

47
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,053
It's about hairless wild snatch.

48
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:12,640
Ew!

49
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,143
What?

50
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:16,982
I actually saw it in the theaters,
and I jizzled all over the place.

51
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:18,903
Really? Shut up!

52
00:02:20,363 --> 00:02:21,700
So, are you in?

53
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,583
Um, OK. Well, can Maya come?

54
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,085
No, like I don't care.

55
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:29,048
Uh, yeah. Sure.

56
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:32,847
- Cool.
- Hi.

57
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,075
- Cool. We'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

58
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,393
- Bye!
- Bye.

59
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:39,068

- What? Keep going.
- You don't wanna do it, Na?

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,542
What if Brendan wants to kiss me tomorrow?

70
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:09,838
I don't know if I want to.

71
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,132
You don't?

72
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,780
He tried last time, and it just felt,
like, really weird and unnatural,

73
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:16,475
but it's like, "Why?
I'm hot. He's hot." Like...

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,729
I think he's gonna.

75
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,693
Maybe it's gonna feel natural on Saturday.

76
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:22,947
Like, it won't be as weird as that time.

77
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:24,743
Maybe.

78
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:26,663
Anna, it's so simple, like...

79
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,376
It's like, this, like...

80
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,569
- I don't know.
- You know what I mean.

81
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:34,846
Yeah, that looks good.

82
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,731
You have to do tongue.

83
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,071
Kinda small head.

84
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:58,142
Stop it!

85
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:01,525
- Hey, Anna, did you...
- Dad! Get out!

86
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:03,946
Maya! Please, get out!

87
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:05,783
- No!
- Maya is, like, naked!

88
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:08,037
- I'm just looking for my Discman.
- Dad, get out!

89
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,206
Get out!

90
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,974
- I don't think I'm gonna go tomorrow.
- Hmm?

91
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:20,813
- I don't think I wanna go.
- Why?

92
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:23,944
'Cause I'm not invited.

93
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:25,447
Yes, you are.

94
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:27,367
No, I'm not.

95
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:31,125
You asked.
Brendan didn't actually invite me.

96
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,337
Oh, my God, you always do this.

97
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:37,680
He just said you're going,
so that means you're invited.

98
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:40,143
Yeah, but you're gonna be, like,
off making out with him,

99
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,732
and I'm just gonna be, like,
sitting there by myself.

100
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,403
Why don't you find somebody
to go with you?

101
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:46,740
Like who?

102
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,499
Flymiamibro's like at a computer
conference this weekend in Tucson.

103
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,547
I don't know. You could ask
one of the guys from soccer practice.

104
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,637
Mm.

105
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:00,141
No.

106
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:19,263
Maya... just do this thing.

107
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:40,848
- Did you get anybody?
- No.

108
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:43,060
Literally, no one will even
look at me, like...

109
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:45,190
Aw! I'm sure that's not true.

110
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:46,398
Yeah!

111
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,576
'Na, can you, like, focus?

112
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:53,289
You're off in Brendan-land waving it up.

113
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,128
Maya, I'm, like, waving at my BF.
Like, just chill.

114
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:58,132
Whatever.

115
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,804
Why don't you just go ask Sam?

116
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:02,934
Stop.

117
00:06:03,226 --> 00:06:04,812
- Like...
- No, I don't want to...

118
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,691
Not to, like, hook up. Just to hang with.

119
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,948
Please.

120
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:16,878
- Go. Come on.
- Fine. Whatever.

121
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,132
- Be nice.
- I am nice.

122
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,596
Hey, turd-hole.

123
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,934
Practicing with all your friends?

124
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,146
Ha-ha-ha. What do you want?

125
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:29,612
Um, are you going to, uh...

126
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,743
that movie thing or whatever tonight?

127
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:35,916
- What movie?
<i>- Wild Things.</i> At Brendan's, like...

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,045
Yeah. Why?

129
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:40,843
- Well...
- Oh, my gosh! Wow, Sam!

130
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,513
You're, like, really good at that.

131
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:45,811
Oh, thanks, Jenna.
It's... it's just dribblin'.

132
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,194
Wait, what? Are you guys serious?

133
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:51,990
Oh, my God!

134
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:55,455
Dribbling's in basketball, moron, like...

135
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,167
No.

136
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,129
It's in uh... soccer.

137
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,258
- Dribbling is in soccer, too.
- Yep.

138
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:03,429
That's what it's called, dribbling.

139
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,193
So, Jenna, a bunch of us are going
to Brendan Tooler's place tonight

140
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:11,956
to watch <i>Wild Things.</i>
It's going to be fun.

141
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:13,658
- You should come.
- Um, yeah.

142
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,621
OK. That sounds fun.

143
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:17,750
Maybe you can show me
some of your moves there.

144
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,754
Well, there is not gonna
be soccer practice,

145
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:21,966
so that literally makes zero sense.

146
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:25,891
Um, cool, yeah.

147
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,895
- See you there.
- All right.

148
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,986
OK, I'm sorry,
but she was actually not invited.

149
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,907
I think it's really weird
that she'd show up.

150
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,368
Like, it's psycho, Sam.

151
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:38,332
I don't know
why you're being such a biatch,

152
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:39,961
because she's actually pretty nice.

153
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:45,639
Nice raging, dumbnuts.

154
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:53,487
I'm freaking nice, too.

155
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:59,416
And this is the den where we watch movies,

156
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,170
and sometimes, I play video games.

157
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:03,925
Oh, my God, it's so cool.

158
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,428
- Yeah.
- No, it's not. It's a duck.

159
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:07,641
Wow thang!

160
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,687
Hmm-mm.

161
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:12,025
What's up?

162
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,321
- Hey.
- 'Sup! 'Sup! 'Sup!

163
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:17,285
- JK.
- What's up, Skyler?

164
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:21,376
Hey. Who's ready for some snacks?

165
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,963
Oh, my gosh.

166
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:24,800
Hi, Mrs. Tooler.

167
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:26,345
I'm Anna Kone.

168
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:29,894
Anna! I've heard so much about you!

169
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,731
I've heard so much about you.

170
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:34,152
Oh, Anna, you are just adorable.

171
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:36,323
Brendan, you talk about her all the time,

172
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:38,536
but you didn't say how adorable she is.

173
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,622
Mom, leave.

174
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:43,880
- Um, your den is so stunning!
- Yeah.

175
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,466
So polite.

176
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,803
She's a keeper, Brendy.

177
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,406
I'm gonna stick your head
in the oven, Mom,

178
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,430
if you don't shut up.

179
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,478
OK. I can take a hint.

180
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:55,821
That must be Cousin Richard.
I'll got let him in.

181
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,323
Go.

182
00:08:57,783 --> 00:08:59,579
Your mom is really sweet.

183
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:01,958
Yeah. Whatever.

184
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,379
- Hey.
- Hey.

185
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:06,383
- Oh, my God.
- Everyone,

186
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,803
this is Cousin Richard.

187
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:09,306
- You got the movie?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:11,184
Used my bro's ID.

189
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,478
They bought it.

190
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:14,274
Why do you need an ID?

191
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,320
'Cause it's like X-rated I think.

192
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:17,948
I thought this was about animals.

193
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:19,660
Well, there are beavers, you know.

194
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:23,793
Oh, my God, Sam! You're, like, so funny.

195
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:26,507
So let's get the party started.

196
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:31,433
Ladies and germs,
tonight's feature film stars Matt Dillon,

197
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:34,523
Kevin Bacon, Denise Richards,
Denise Richards' blammos,

198
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,360
and Neve Campbell.

199
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:40,661
It is rated "R" for adult language
and sexual situations.

200
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,413
- Yes!
- Let's go.

201
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:43,541
Yeah.

202
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,631
With a runtime of 108 minutes
including credits,

203
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:50,429
which you wanna stick around for,
I give you <i>Wild Things.</i>

204
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:52,893
Yeah, this is good.

205
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,237
Switch seats with me.

206
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,578
Why?

207
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:45,498
So you'll be closer to...

208
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:47,126
Shh!

209
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,428
You can sit beside Brendan.

210
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:53,765
No.

211
00:10:53,848 --> 00:10:55,434
Yes.

212
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:13,930
<i>So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?</i>

213
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:17,831
<i>Washing that old Jeep of mine
is sort of waste of time.</i>

214
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:19,525
<i>- Don't you think?
- Not at all.</i>

215
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:01,441
Brendan wants to hook up with Anna.

216
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:09,583
Brendan wants to hook up with you.

217
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,965
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes. He does.

218
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,971
Listen.
Cousin Richard literally just told me.

219
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,374
My God, go! Go follow him.

220
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:31,627
No! No.

221
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,589
- Go! Go!
- You should go follow him.

222
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,009
Go. It's now or never. Go.

223
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:37,973
Come with me. Come with me.

224
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,310
- No, let her go.
- I'm letting them go, Jenna.

225
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:41,856
Jenna, shut up!

226
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:43,693
- Will you please come with me?
- No.

227
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:46,364
I'm gonna be there with you in your head
the whole...

228
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:47,909
Move.

229
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:49,913
Go!

230
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,584
Bye.

231
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,011
- They're gonna get it all tonight.
- Oh, my God!

232
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:00,685
Don't try anything, perv.

233
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,396
I'll just move.

234
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,029
Sam, I was kidding.

235
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:10,496
Is this OK?

236
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:12,458
Absolutely.

237
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,660
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:57,047
Just gonna use the bathroom.

239
00:13:57,716 --> 00:13:58,843
OK.

240
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:09,280
<i>So you got my mom's money.</i>

241
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:12,244
<i>How much?</i>

242
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:38,166
Hey.

243
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:03,169
<i>After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.</i>

244
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:05,298
<i>After tonight?</i>

245
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:11,603
Oh, busted.

246
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:19,285
How was it?

247
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:21,832
I'll tell you later, OK?

248
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,915
Was it good?

249
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,005
Oh, here it is. Everyone needs to shut up.

250
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:39,659
<i>God in Heaven.</i>

251
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,675
Are you OK?

252
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:51,140
What happened?

253
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:54,898
- 'Na, what's wrong?
- Stop.

254
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:11,347
And then, like, were your lips
close together

255
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:13,977
when you guys were standing
close together?

256
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,902
Yeah... and then they touched.

257
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:20,323
They did.

258
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:23,622
- That's, like, romantic.
- No, it wasn't.

259
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:27,964
- Yo, it literally wasn't at all.
- Why?

260
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:33,349
He puts his lips, like,
all the way around mine...

261
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:38,359
- Ew!
- And, like, sucked.

262
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:42,952
- What?
- It's not funny.

263
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,417
Wait. And then what? Was that it?
Like, he just sucked?

264
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,507
No, and then he put his tongue
in my mouth, and he, like...

265
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:54,809
did like a torpedo cat tongue,
and, like, drilled my mouth.

266
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:55,936
What was it like?

267
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:58,024
- What did he do with it?
- Like this.

268
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:00,738
- Ew! Ew! Stop!
- Yeah.

269
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:02,491
I can't. I wish I could.

270
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:05,473
What did you do with your tongue?
Did you do it back or did you just, like...

271
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:09,547
It was, like, pinned back,
like, it was in trouble, you know.

272
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:13,806
- That's crazy.
- I know.

273
00:19:14,974 --> 00:19:16,310
It was awful.

274
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:18,649
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:23,074
Well, at least you just, like,
had your first kiss, you know.

276
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:25,161
I wish that I hadn't.

277
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:28,334
- Don't say that.
- I really do.

278
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:33,679
Everything is just different now,
and I just have to breakup with him, so...

279
00:19:33,762 --> 00:19:35,933
Really?

280
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:37,352
Yeah.

281
00:19:38,564 --> 00:19:42,195
He's not the Brendan that bought us snacks
at the bowling alley, you know.

282
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,279
Mm-hmm.

283
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:46,955
He's like the Brendan that drilled
the back of my throat with his tongue.

284
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:52,173
So... it's up to you
to get the next boyfriend.

285
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,136
Why?

286
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:57,852
What about Cousin Richard?

287
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:02,904
- Do you like him?
- No, I don't. It's not him.

288
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,241
Oh, it's someone?

289
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,788
Is it Sam?

290
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,542
No.

291
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:12,924
No. Let's just go to bed.

292
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:14,134
- Wait, look at me...
- What?

293
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:15,930
And let me ask you again. Is it Sam?

294
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,476
- Is what Sam?
- Do you like Sam?

295
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:19,812
Mm-mm.

296
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,319
Mm-mm.

297
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,799
Hey, butt-rat!

298
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:35,468
Hey, Maya.

299
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:42,023
What the hell? You're, like, being weird.
I'm mad at you.

300
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,281
- OK.
- Seriously?

301
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:50,498
I normally say things to you,
and then you say, like, mean things back.

302
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,503
Mm. Sorr...

303
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,634
God, you're just, like, being so lame.

304
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,349
It's like ever since you started dating
whatever her fricking name is,

305
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,154
- you're just being...
- Her name is Jenna.

306
00:21:02,188 --> 00:21:04,527
Maybe if you try to be nicer to me
once in a while.

307
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:06,531
- I'm nice.
- Oh, yeah?

308
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:08,869
So how about you say
something nice right now?

309
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:12,125
- Like, right now?
- Yeah.

310
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:17,302
Argh! OK, like...

311
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:24,399
You're, like, less dandruffy
in carpool this year.

312
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:26,613
Oh, my God.

313
00:21:26,863 --> 00:21:28,909
OK, I'm sorry. OK.

314
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:31,038
You...

315
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:33,125
OK, you're...

316
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:41,559
you're, like, the funniest person
in our entire grade.

317
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:48,155
- Not bad.
- Yeah?

318
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,413
Do you have something nice
to say about me?

319
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:56,255
- Yeah.
- If you want.

320
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,806
Well, you do a really good <i>Ace Ventura.</i>

321
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:03,854
And?

322
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:07,570
And um...

323
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:12,580
you are a awesome friend.

324
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:17,882
That's it?

325
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:26,315
- Hey, Maya. Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

326
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:28,612
Walk me to class?

327
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:31,743
Um, sure. See you later, Maya.

328
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,495
Whatever.

329
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:36,753
You've... left your locker open.

330
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:43,349
<i>- OK. So, can I read this to you?
- Yeah.</i>

331
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:45,979
OK. "Dear Brendan, wassup!

332
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:50,112
This is Anna Kone. We've been
boyfriend-girlfriend for three weeks now,

333
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:52,367
which is the longest relationship
I've ever been in.

334
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,791
I've been doing a lot of thinking
since we kissed last night at <i>Wild Things.</i>

335
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,771
This is hard, but I don't think
you're the one for me.

336
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:00,067
So I'm breaking up with you.
I hope we can still be friends.

337
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:01,678
See you in band. Anna Kone."

338
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,224
That's really good.

339
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:06,997
Should I mention about the kiss
that it was bad that he needs to work on?

340
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,401
No, I don't think so. That's mean.

341
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:10,862
- Right.
- Yeah.

342
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:12,407
Will you give it to him for me?

343
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,244
Yeah. I will.

344
00:23:19,672 --> 00:23:21,133
Shh!

345
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:28,147
It's Becca.

346
00:23:30,318 --> 00:23:32,030
Do you think she knows?

347
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:34,200
Hmm.

348
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,545
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

349
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,107
You need to get that to him
before she does.

350
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:43,553
- OK. I can give...
- Run fast. Go! Go!

351
00:23:48,897 --> 00:23:52,028
Excuse me. Have you seen
Brendan Tooler? Skyler? No?

352
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,825
Have you seen Brendan or Skyler? Brendan?

353
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:58,082
Have you seen Brendan or Skyler?
None of you!

354
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,185
Phew!

355
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:13,445
- Hey, Kone,
- Hey, Becca.

356
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:17,036
Oh, my God.

357
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,130
<i>Dear Anna,</i>

358
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:25,512
<i>I don't think it's a good idea
that we go out anymore.</i>

359
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:28,560
<i>I'm breaking up with you. Brendan.</i>

360
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:43,882
I couldn't find Brendan
or Skyler anywhere,

361
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,719
- so I can't reach...
- It's OK.

362
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,681
It's OK. We got broken up with.

363
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:50,394
- Oh, my God, no.
- Yeah.

364
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:53,610
- I'm sorry.
- It's whatever, like...

365
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:56,406
I should've been faster. I'm sorry.

366
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,164
- I'm an idiot.
- No. I am.

367
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:08,388
It's OK.

368
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:15,069
Your beady stupid little eyes,
your fat nose.

369
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:23,418
I play your stupid saxophone like that,
asshole.

370
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:27,594
What?

371
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:32,311
Your mom said she overheard some stuff
in carpool about you and Braydan.

372
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:35,902
That's not his name,
and I don't wanna talk about it.

373
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:41,329
You really shouldn't hold things inside.

374
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,676
Are you guys serious?
What do you want me to say right now?

375
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:50,640
Do you want me to tell you
that I got dumped?

376
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:53,980
It's embarrassing.
That's what's happened, so...

377
00:25:54,063 --> 00:25:56,777
- You're so much cuter than he is.
- Totally.

378
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,409
You're gonna have so many boyfriends
in your life...

379
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,704
- Totally.
- Before you

380
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,498
find the one you wanna be with.

381
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:04,835
I guess, yeah.

382
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:08,050
But... but look...

383
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:13,226
this is it. This is... This is love.

384
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:16,692
And you didn't have that with Brendan.

385
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:19,698
I know I didn't, and I still kissed him.

386
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:21,661
- Well, you had your first kiss.
- Oh!

387
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,463
We had and I wish I didn't.
It was disgusting.

388
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:34,895
You know... life is...
it's about experiences,

389
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:37,943
and someone else will come along.

390
00:26:38,318 --> 00:26:42,994
Kissing definitely gets better. Right?

391
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:44,748
Yeah.

392
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,177
What is wrong with you guys?

393
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:53,390
See. It gets better...

394
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:57,231
- OK. Oh, my God!
- And better...

395
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,903
and better.

396
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:28,168
Ooh!

397
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:36,309
Ooh!

398
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:41,152
Ooh!

399
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:45,954
Ooh, ooh!
