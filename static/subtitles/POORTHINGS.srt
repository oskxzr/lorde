1
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:32,774
Ba.

2
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,401
Ba! Ba!

3
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:39,989
Ba, ba, ba.

4
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,784
- Bye.
- Ba, ba.

5
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,455
A pile of organs

6
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,791
without the spark of self
from a brain

7
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:52,043
or the pump of blood
from a heart.

8
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,962
Just a butcher's tray
for a Sunday lunch.

9
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:59,967
Now, who would like
to reconstruct the organs?

10
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,887
And who can tell human
from animal,

11
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,056
if there is a difference?

12
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,060
Come, come.

13
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:13,231
You did puzzles as children,
did you not?

14
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,025
Is it just me, or is it
devilishly hard to concentrate

15
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,610
when the monster's talking?

16
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,905
He is
an extraordinary surgeon.

17
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,615
His research
is groundbreaking.

18
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,898
His father founded this place.

19
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,844
Have you
mistaken yourself as included

20
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,787
in this conversation,
Max McCandles?

21
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,456
Your physical proximity to us
does not make it so.

22
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,959
Fuck off, old pal.
Get yourself a suit.

23
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,965
You really think that's
where the liver goes, sir?

24
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,886
Can I ask what is the purpose
of putting them back in, sir?

25
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,596
My amusement.

26
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,558
Mr. Max McCandles!

27
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,977
Walk with me
at the end of the lesson.

28
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,692
Your paper.

29
00:05:58,693 --> 00:05:59,861
You liked it, sir?

30
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:02,154
It showed signs
of a conventional mind

31
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,907
straining hard
to almost touch mediocrity.

32
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:06,343
- Thank you.
- I need someone.

33
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,786
- An assistant on a project.
- I would love to.

34
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,831
- Are you a religious man?
- I believe in God.

35
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,541
Me or the deity?

36
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,143
Humorous, as you're
often known as the...

37
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,669
It is a joke
of my own making.

38
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,963
I do not need it
explicated for me.

39
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,173
The very devil's work.

40
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,057
Have you thought
of growing a beard, sir?

41
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,386
I look like
a big dog in a cravat.

42
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,679
Kids like dogs.

43
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,431
Uh, this job.

44
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,932
Yes. Come.

45
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,543
God! God.

46
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,795
God.

47
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,132
- Hello.
- Hello.

48
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,802
Bella, this is Mr. McCandles.

49
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,429
Hello, Bella.

50
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,475
Oh. Uh...

51
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,685
- Bud.
- Blood.

52
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,062
- Bud.
- Blood.

53
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,730
- Blood.
- Marvelous.

54
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,065
I'm fine. I'm fine.

55
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,030
What a very pretty retard.

56
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,450
She suffered
a brain injury.

57
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,826
I repaired it.

58
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,372
Her mental age and her body
are not quite synchronized.

59
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,706
Language is coming.

60
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,668
She is progressing
at an accelerated pace.

61
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,128
She is stunning.

62
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:44,090
I need
to meticulously note

63
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,341
her progression.

64
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,635
You will do this for me?

65
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:48,719
It would be my honor.

66
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:49,804
Wee!

67
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:51,847
Wee!

68
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,934
Yes.
It is exciting, Bella.

69
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,603
"Wee."
I believe she's doing...

70
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,188
Mrs. Prim!

71
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,316
Wee.

72
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,333
Do you not like kippers?

73
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:10,009
Uh, I am quite partial
to them, actually.

74
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:13,512
I find them to be, uh,
nice in the morning...

75
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,495
Bella cut, too?

76
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,455
Just dead ones for Bella.

77
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,539
Just dead.

78
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:41,999
Just dead.

79
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,375
Just dead.

80
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,898
Squish! Squish, squish.

81
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,528
Chog!

82
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,695
Chog!

83
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,991
Run!

84
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,661
Chog.

85
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,139
<i>She... She gathers
15 words a day.</i>

86
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,515
<i>Hmm.</i>

87
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,309
<i>Her coordination
is unstable at best.</i>

88
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,936
<i>In the evenings,
there's progress.</i>

89
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,354
<i>Mm.</i>

90
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,857
<i>Her hair grows one inch
every two days.</i>

91
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,942
<i>- I have a hair diagram here.
- Excellent.</i>

92
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,903
You may go. See you tomorrow.

93
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,865
Sir, where did she come from?

94
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,743
I believe your job
is collecting data.

95
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:03,205
When I add inane questions
to it, I'll let you know.

96
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,796
"And so, when they returned
from the wood,

97
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,592
"she was reunited
with her Mummy and Daddy.

98
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,636
"That night, for dinner,

99
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,097
"they ate cake
until they were sick.

100
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,310
"They were so happy
to be back together."

101
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,106
You me Daddy, God?

102
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,276
- I...
- Prim say you not be.

103
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:34,737
Bella nowhere girl.

104
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,574
Where that be? Nowhere?

105
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,910
You are an orphan.

106
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,078
Your parents died.

107
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,249
Then you cut parents up, God?

108
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,334
No.

109
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,753
They were my friends.

110
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,298
They were brave explorers,

111
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,593
and they were killed
in a landslide

112
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,345
in South America.

113
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,766
They pushed the boundaries
of what was known,

114
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,601
and they paid the price.

115
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,479
But that is the only way
to live, Bella.

116
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,650
They sent you to me
to care for you.

117
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,070
Dead?

118
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,490
I'm afraid so, my darling.

119
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,785
Poor Bella.

120
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,330
But love God.

121
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,462
Sleep here.

122
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,423
No.

123
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,187
Good night, dear Bella.

124
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,235
This, parents.

125
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,404
Peru, yes.

126
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,950
Why you pen book every nut?

127
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,244
I must note down
your nutritional intake.

128
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,501
How many?

129
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,420
Um...

130
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,592
Tell Bella other places.

131
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:24,138
That's Lisbon, Portugal.

132
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,016
The south of France. The Alps.

133
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,688
Australia.

134
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,858
Far away and dangerous,
in both people and animal.

135
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,068
Bella want look at world.

136
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:41,947
Just...

137
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,742
- Bella.
- Hmm?

138
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,999
Bella, I don't think
we're allowed up here.

139
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,083
Let's just...

140
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,266
Bella.

141
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,354
Bella.

142
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:15,856
No.

143
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,651
Bella, this is dangerous.

144
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:37,628
Bella.

145
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,589
No, Bella.

146
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,443
God.

147
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,114
Outside must go.

148
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:09,076
Outside? No, we work.

149
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,619
Cut fingers?

150
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,871
Candles take me.
Candles.

151
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,331
Of...
Of course I can. If...

152
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,666
No.

153
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,917
Yes. Out!

154
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,961
Has she ever been outside?

155
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,045
No.

156
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,673
I have created
a perfectly entertaining

157
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,299
and safe world for Bella.

158
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,384
Now.

159
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,137
- Bella.
- Now!

160
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,267
- Now!
- Bella.

161
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:04,715
You know, so many things
outside can kill you, Bella.

162
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,799
Kill dead?

163
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,177
Snakes, carriages,
sharp-faced birds,

164
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,513
earthquakes, inhalation
of toxic grass seeds.

165
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,416
Bella.

166
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,960
Bella.

167
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,275
Bella. Look.

168
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,412
- Kill it.
- What?

169
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,678
Why you funny thumbs, God?

170
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,643
Once when I was very small,

171
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,689
my father pinned my thumbs
into a small iron case

172
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,942
to see whether he could retard
the growth cycle of bones.

173
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,821
Now, the pain was so great,

174
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,156
to stop myself from weeping,

175
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,285
I would stare deeply
into my other fingers,

176
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,121
and simply by observation,

177
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,417
begin to parse out
the epidemiological elements.

178
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,794
When he came back,

179
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:09,089
to his surprise,
I was smiling.

180
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,050
Good God.

181
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,387
He was a man
of unconventional mind.

182
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,688
Time to go.

183
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,567
Uh, a storm approaches.

184
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,990
Why must you scare her so?

185
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,366
She's an experiment,

186
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,285
and I must control
the conditions

187
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,580
or our results
will not be pure. Mm!

188
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,302
Stop!
God, we go!

189
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,428
No, Bella.

190
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,138
Bella want walk in ice cream.

191
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,222
No.

192
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,557
Bella wants!

193
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,934
My face. People scared of God.

194
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,019
Laugh at God.

195
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,562
God lovely.

196
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,022
Like dog face.

197
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,149
Woof. Woof, woof!

198
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,567
Quite.

199
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,861
- Stop! Me walk.
- No!

200
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:18,116
No now? No never?

201
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,035
Just no.

202
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,456
Ahhh!

203
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,961
- Bella!
- No!

204
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:32,756
- No! No! No!
- Hey! Bella!

205
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,342
No!

206
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,973
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No!

207
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,558
No! No!

208
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,282
I'm sorry, my darling.

209
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,911
Mother of God.

210
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,795
What did you do to her?

211
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,671
Why are you hiding her?

212
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,375
Tell me what all this means,
or I'll go to the police.

213
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,472
I shall.
For it is a happy tale.

214
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,116
<i>It is rare to get a body,</i>

215
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,160
<i>albeit dead,
but so close to life.</i>

216
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,913
Rigor had not set in.

217
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,499
The body had hardly cooled.

218
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,543
<i>No pulse.</i>

219
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,586
<i>But some electric currents,</i>

220
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,171
so I could have
kept her alive.

221
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,589
But you didn't.

222
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,552
<i>I knew nothing of the life
she had abandoned,</i>

223
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:27,556
<i>except she hated it so much
that she had chosen not to be,</i>

224
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,723
and forever.

225
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,433
What would she feel

226
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,477
<i>on being dragged</i>

227
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,856
<i>from her carefully chosen
blank eternity</i>

228
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,859
and forced to be put
in one of our understaffed,

229
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:42,821
poorly-equipped madhouses,
reformatories or jails?

230
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,574
<i>For in this Christian nation,</i>

231
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,827
<i>suicide is treated
as lunacy or crime.</i>

232
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,288
<i>Who was I to decide her fate?</i>

233
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:55,500
But then there was also,
on my part, a recognition.

234
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,712
All my research
had come to this moment.

235
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,423
Fate had brought me
a dead body,

236
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:02,674
<i>and a live infant.</i>

237
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,967
It was obvious.

238
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,051
It was?

239
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,803
Take the infant's brain out

240
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,680
and put it
in the full-grown woman,

241
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,140
reanimate her, and watch.

242
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,017
Jesus!

243
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,946
She knows?

244
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,322
No.

245
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,406
Who was she?

246
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,075
No idea.

247
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:14,412
But would you rather
the world did not have Bella?

248
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,448
- Mrs. Prim?
- Hmm?

249
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,118
Bella discover happy
when she want.

250
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,202
Uh-huh.

251
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,413
You are a sour face,
but I fix you.

252
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:05,041
Close eyes.

253
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,253
Oh! No!

254
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,547
Just wait. It takes a moment.

255
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,008
She grabbed my hairy business.

256
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:15,510
She's sick!

257
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,594
Bella.

258
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,596
Bella have discover
something I must share.

259
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,681
Watch.

260
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:22,725
- What if put cucumber in me?
- No.

261
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,020
Bella! Bella!

262
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,149
Cease working yourself
immediately.

263
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,233
What?

264
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,153
In polite society,
that is not done.

265
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:34,737
Oh.

266
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,365
Oh.

267
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,659
Just do not.

268
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,296
What... is that?

269
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:55,216
My father took out
my oxyntic and pyloric glands,

270
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,886
so I must make
my own gastric juices.

271
00:27:58,469 --> 00:27:59,846
Why in God's name
would he do that?

272
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,348
To discover what no one knew.

273
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,185
Turns out we need them.
Ideally.

274
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:07,979
Bella,

275
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,398
you have not eaten.

276
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,359
Do not.

277
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:22,952
Good night.

278
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,413
'Night.

279
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,724
You know,

280
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,810
I'm actually something
of a romantic, Max.

281
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,479
What?

282
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,232
I believe I see love
between you and Bella.

283
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,193
Uh, I... She is...

284
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,779
Perhaps you should marry her.

285
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,113
What?

286
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:00,448
I think she loves you.

287
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:02,492
Oh.

288
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,204
<i>I've seen people
look at each other with love,</i>

289
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,372
<i>as an observer.</i>

290
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,582
<i>Not the subject, of course.
I see it.</i>

291
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,085
<i>You do?</i>

292
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,587
<i>I, um...</i>

293
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:18,049
I do have feelings for her.

294
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,634
So, you would?

295
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,679
Take Bella out.

296
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,722
Bella...

297
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,140
Um...

298
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:27,725
I...

299
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:31,479
Feel funny?

300
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:38,903
- Um...
- Do Bella.

301
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:47,078
<i>I was wondering</i>

302
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,663
if perhaps
you were raising her

303
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:49,747
to be your mistress.

304
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,208
A dark thought unworthy of me,
I know.

305
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,587
So, you are not laying
with her?

306
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:02,051
Spermatic ejaculation can only
induce homeostasis in me

307
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,846
if accompanied
by prolonged stimulation

308
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,264
of higher nerve centers

309
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,516
whose pressure
on the ductless glands

310
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,310
changes the chemistry
of my blood

311
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:12,562
not for a few
spasmodic minutes,

312
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,022
but for many days.

313
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:16,399
What?

314
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,818
I am a eunuch
and can't fuck her.

315
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:22,155
To get a sexual response
from my body

316
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,741
would take the same amount
of electricity

317
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:25,867
as runs North London.

318
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:29,370
- Mm-hmm.
- Besides, my paternal feelings

319
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,831
seem to outweigh
my sexual thoughts.

320
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,210
<i>I apologize
for my own dark thoughts.</i>

321
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:37,503
<i>Not dark at all.</i>

322
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:41,758
<i>Men's, indeed all sexuality,
is basically immoral.</i>

323
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,760
<i>Not all, sir.</i>

324
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,678
<i>Do you wish
to marry her or not?</i>

325
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,891
I wish to marry you.
Be my wife.

326
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,276
Let us touch
each other's genital pieces.

327
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,944
Uh... No. No.

328
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,155
I do not wish
to take advantage of you.

329
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,406
You are special.

330
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,283
When we are wed.

331
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,291
One condition.

332
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,127
She must desire it also,
I understand.

333
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,796
Two conditions, then.

334
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,172
That one you said,

335
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:25,093
and you must live here
with me, always.

336
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:29,138
<i>I will have
a legal agreement drawn up.</i>

337
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:38,731
Hmm.

338
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,666
Curious contract.

339
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,793
There are several
spelling errors.

340
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,796
Oh. Immaterial to
the legal bindingness of it,

341
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,005
I assure you.

342
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:08,928
Must be quite a woman
to warrant such binding.

343
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,893
If you'll excuse me,
I need to use the facilities.

344
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,356
Are you five years old that
you can't hold your water?

345
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:21,899
Weak bladder, sir.

346
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:25,069
Like my father before me
and his before him.

347
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:27,613
You may have prostate cancer.
Look into it.

348
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,449
Will do.

349
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:38,518
Ms. Bella Baxter, as per
your contract, no doubt.

350
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,270
Good afternoon, visiting man.

351
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,314
Want my hat?

352
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:45,441
Would it suit me?

353
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,777
Yes.

354
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,112
It is foolish good.

355
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,281
I had to meet this woman
who would inspire

356
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:55,201
such a contract of marriage
that imprisons her.

357
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,370
What you mean?

358
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,496
You shall live here,

359
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:01,958
travel with Mr. Max McCandles
and Baxter abroad,

360
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,918
but not go forth in the city.

361
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:05,753
I see.

362
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,172
They love me tight.

363
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,757
I understand why.

364
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,093
I have to pinch you,
to see if you are real.

365
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,761
You will not... Ah.

366
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,057
Who is you?

367
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,812
Mr. Duncan Wedderburn.

368
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:54,510
Open.

369
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,480
How you get up here?

370
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,482
Shh.

371
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:09,567
I climbed.

372
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:29,962
You were watch me long?

373
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:31,422
Not long.

374
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,341
You did not see me
working on myself

375
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:34,925
to get happiness, did you?

376
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:38,054
It is not polites, I know.

377
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,561
Do not care
for polite society.

378
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:46,771
It's fucking boring.

379
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,856
Destroys one's soul.

380
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,525
God not believe in soul.

381
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:56,155
I think God's the actual
author of the soul idea.

382
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,199
Godwin Baxter?

383
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,242
That burnt dog.

384
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,869
What is that story?

385
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:05,289
You are a prisoner
and I aim to free you.

386
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,336
Something in you,
some hungry being,

387
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:13,255
hungry for experience,
freedom, touch.

388
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,383
To see the unknown
and know it.

389
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,552
So, why am I here, you ask?

390
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,723
I'm going to Lisbon on Friday.
I'd like you to come.

391
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:24,600
Lisbon of Portugal?

392
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:26,769
That is the Lisbon I speak of.

393
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:29,647
God never allow it.

394
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,901
That's why I'm not asking him.

395
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:36,737
I'm asking you.

396
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,242
Bella not safe with you,
I think.

397
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:44,495
You are absolutely... not.

398
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:03,013
May I have a moment
of value time, dear God?

399
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,473
Of course, Bella.

400
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:07,226
I wanted to tell you big news.

401
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,353
Bella is dizzy with excite.

402
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:10,813
What is it?

403
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,606
Tonight, at midnight,

404
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:17,027
I secretly run away
with one Duncan Wedderburn.

405
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:18,154
What?

406
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,613
You will wish to stop me.

407
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:20,740
I shall stop you.

408
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,700
You hold Bella too tight.

409
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,202
I must set forth into waters.

410
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,328
We can travel.

411
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:29,331
You, me, and Max whom,
I will remind you,

412
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,750
you are betrothed to.

413
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,626
I will marry Max,

414
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,212
as he seems right for that,

415
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:39,091
but first, I shall adventure
on Duncan Wedderburn

416
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:42,928
who, I think,
cares little of damage to me,

417
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:46,557
but will be interesting
as well.

418
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,225
I can't let you go.

419
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,067
Kiss me and set me forth.

420
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,028
If you do not,

421
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:03,407
Bella's insides
shall turn rotten with hate.

422
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:05,785
- Hate?
- Hate.

423
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,295
Unpack those bags, Prim.

424
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,339
Godwin has told me your plan.

425
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:19,632
I do not blame you, Bella.

426
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,550
That man is a cad and a rake.

427
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:22,676
He has insidious ways

428
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,595
of getting under
a naive woman's skin.

429
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:27,097
It is mostly his eyes on mine.

430
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:29,892
And his hands
when between Bella's legs

431
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,603
and whisper words I can't hear

432
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,688
but heat in my body.

433
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:36,232
Jesus, Bella.

434
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,692
We are engaged.
I love you.

435
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:40,945
And when I return,
we marriage,

436
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,197
and be happy
as two doves on a branch.

437
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,032
- You think I need travel hat?
- No!

438
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,575
This will not do.

439
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,619
It cannot!

440
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:49,954
I'll see to this man myself.

441
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:52,248
I will beat his handsome face

442
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,625
into a porridge
of blood and bones!

443
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,502
Max, you are flushed,

444
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,921
and I am too
at sight of different Max.

445
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,048
I apologize,
but I will not let a man

446
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,425
that I know has nothing
but ill intent in his mind

447
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:06,136
and nothing for you
in his heart trick you.

448
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,973
I will smash
his fucking head in.

449
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:16,939
Mm.

450
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,823
Bella? It...

451
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,120
Bella.

452
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,714
Goodbye, later dove.

453
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,425
I will see you
after grand adventure.

454
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:47,595
God?

455
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,261
She's gone.

456
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,723
I am having port
for breakfast.

457
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,850
It is strangely delicious.

458
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,685
Why did you not stop her?

459
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:39,897
She is a being of free will.

460
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,403
She's now out there. Alone.

461
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,447
She will be fine.

462
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,449
I'm a fool.
I should have stopped her.

463
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,618
We are men of science.

464
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:57,206
This emotionality is unseemly.

465
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,252
I just hope she's all right.

466
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:26,002
You are
the most beautiful woman

467
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,027
I've ever seen.

468
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,613
I will not lie,
I have been with many.

469
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,657
Mrs. Prim said you were wolf

470
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,534
with scent
of hundred women on you.

471
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,035
She undersells it.

472
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:38,247
Okay. Oysters.

473
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,873
Have you had them before?

474
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,208
I have not.

475
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:47,548
Shuck, chuck and bubble.

476
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:51,093
Mm.

477
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,054
Mm.

478
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,476
Rollicking.

479
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:04,231
Rollicking.

480
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:09,153
Wait. Bella.

481
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:19,580
So, nuns and monks

482
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,582
would starch their clothes
with egg whites

483
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,792
and, with the yolks,
make these tarts.

484
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,627
Now, how to eat them?

485
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,421
I will guess
through the mouth.

486
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:30,549
They must not be eaten
dainty flake by dainty flake,

487
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:33,469
but inhaled with gusto,
like life itself.

488
00:42:40,017 --> 00:42:41,393
Incredible.

489
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,313
Who made these?
We need more.

490
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,940
No more. One's enough.
Any more is too much.

491
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,234
It's siesta time.

492
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:50,986
What is siesta?

493
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,474
Why do people not just do this

494
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:21,850
all the time?

495
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:25,729
Well, at the risk
of being immodest,

496
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:28,774
you've just been thrice fucked
by the very best.

497
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:29,983
It's probable no other man

498
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,787
would ever bring you
to the raptures I have.

499
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:34,530
I feel bad for you.

500
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:39,618
Well, then it will just be you
I do furious jumping with.

501
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,037
Furious jumping?

502
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:43,747
I love that.

503
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:45,624
I'm rested.

504
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,543
Let us go again.

505
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:48,752
Again?

506
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,088
Unfortunately,

507
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,798
even I have my limits.

508
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:55,175
Men cannot keep coming back
for more.

509
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:57,553
It is a physiological problem?

510
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,763
A weakness in men?

511
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:02,141
Mm... Well...

512
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:05,894
Perhaps so.

513
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,523
You'd be advised,
if it's not too late,

514
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,358
not to fall in love with me.

515
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:13,569
I have very little to offer

516
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:15,487
in the way of constancy.

517
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:16,780
Just adventure.

518
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:17,990
I see.

519
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:20,659
Let us sleep.

520
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:50,480
Taxi, madam?

521
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:32,369
Good evening...

522
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,080
Duncan Wedderburn.

523
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,666
Bella, where were you?
You disappeared.

524
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,584
I did not.

525
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,254
Nobody can just disappear.

526
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:43,839
What?

527
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,632
Can they? Disappear?

528
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,842
No, of course not.

529
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:48,677
What the fuck
are you talking...

530
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,761
Where were you?

531
00:48:50,137 --> 00:48:53,723
I wanted a tart and then
an adventure befell me.

532
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:56,726
I did not know how to return
and then I heard it.

533
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:57,811
The tram.

534
00:48:57,894 --> 00:49:00,605
I will walk to the noise,
and I found it.

535
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:02,399
Amazement to Bella.

536
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,942
Explorer bloods in me.

537
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:06,087
Bella, it's dangerous
to go out without me.

538
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:07,112
I have adventured it

539
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,489
and found nothing
but sugar and violence.

540
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:11,158
It is most charming.

541
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:12,325
I am fine.

542
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:15,579
Now, I must lie down and
you must lie down on top of me

543
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:16,955
and do more furious jumping.

544
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,127
Kitty.

545
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:25,589
Did you see the new show
in London by Wilde?

546
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:26,965
Marvelously witty.

547
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,341
I loved it.

548
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:29,926
"A handbag."

549
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:35,557
Bella.

550
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:37,934
What?

551
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,605
Why I keep it in my mouth
if it is revolting?

552
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:44,816
I have said that before
to Gerald.

553
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:49,237
- If you catch my drift.
- Uh...

554
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,323
You are wicked.

555
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,408
Oh. Because
you mean his penis.

556
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,662
Duncan's can sometimes
be salty.

557
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:02,667
Good God, Bella.

558
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,213
I must go punch that baby.

559
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:12,093
Bella.

560
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:19,100
Your behavior
is unconscionable.

561
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:20,393
Will you behave?

562
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:22,729
The food
was cacking my throat,

563
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,397
the baby annoying,

564
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:26,691
and the woman
boring with words.

565
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:28,151
You will rejoin the table

566
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:30,987
and will confine yourself to
the following three phrases,

567
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,448
"How marvelous!", "Delighted"

568
00:50:33,532 --> 00:50:37,118
and "How did they make
the pastry so crisp?" Yes?

569
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,371
You are hurting Bella.

570
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:40,789
Sorry.

571
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,666
Reason does not penetrate.

572
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:43,750
Let us go.

573
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:49,256
Ow.

574
00:51:01,393 --> 00:51:03,853
Are you enjoying Lisbon,
Bella?

575
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:06,940
Delighted.

576
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,945
Kitty, how is
your dear father?

577
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:13,029
He's very unwell.

578
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,532
I fear he will not see
the year out.

579
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:16,992
- Oh.
- How marvelous.

580
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:19,619
How did they get
the pastry so crisp?

581
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,848
Good God.

582
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:41,766
What is it?

583
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:43,935
From her.

584
00:51:47,314 --> 00:51:49,691
"Me good. Lisbon.

585
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:53,194
"Sugar tart lick me all day."

586
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:56,698
At least I hope that's
all one sentence, anyway.

587
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,092
- Do you think they're...
- Fucking?

588
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,117
Yes.

589
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:01,953
Also,

590
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:03,413
fellating a tram.

591
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:19,572
Does your head ache too,
Duncan Wedderburn?

592
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:22,200
And I also am starving
for dinner.

593
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:23,868
Where the fuck were you?

594
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:28,998
Victoria Blessington?

595
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,377
I haven't seen you for years.

596
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,295
And you still have not,

597
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:36,923
as I am Bella Baxter,

598
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,717
strange feathered lady.

599
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,636
I apologize.
I could've sworn you were she.

600
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:43,972
Hmm.

601
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:47,726
Right.

602
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:49,018
Shall we?

603
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:52,522
The steak, the fish,

604
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,816
little caramel things in pots

605
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,402
that old spotted people
over there have.

606
00:53:57,485 --> 00:53:59,112
I don't want caramel in pots.

607
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:01,740
Of course not.
That was all for Bella.

608
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,324
Order at your whim.

609
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:07,954
You are cross at Bella's
outings and adventures.

610
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,290
And yet
we must discover by whim,

611
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:13,376
as spoken by Duncan Wedderburn
to Bella Baxter,

612
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,919
day one of Lisbon love affair.

613
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:16,504
Touché.

614
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:18,965
Understand me never lived
outside God's house.

615
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:20,049
What?

616
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:22,510
So, Bella so much to discover,

617
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:24,721
and your sad face

618
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:28,224
makes me discover
angry feelings for you.

619
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:30,977
Right.

620
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:34,373
I have become
the very thing I hate,

621
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:36,733
a grasping succubus
of a lover.

622
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:40,779
I've pried many of them off me
and now I'm it.

623
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:42,363
Fuck!

624
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:52,767
You, like me, are a creature
of freedom in the moments.

625
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:57,052
What do you keep
doing that for?

626
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:00,400
A man over there
repeated blinks at me.

627
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:02,610
I blink back.

628
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:04,195
For polites, I think.

629
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:19,043
We are going to dance in town.
Please join us.

630
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:21,296
I have never danced in town.

631
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:35,602
- Duncan!
- Can't!

632
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:50,742
You're quite mad.

633
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,828
Stop talking as your sounds
make Bella angry!

634
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:55,204
I will not stop talking.

635
00:56:55,288 --> 00:56:56,473
If I have something
to say, I'll...

636
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:58,416
Ouch.

637
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,341
All right.

638
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:11,012
What's this?

639
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:13,514
Oh.

640
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:16,809
A man was teaching me chess,

641
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:18,978
and he said he thought
I would probably have

642
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:21,606
the softest skin
he had ever touched.

643
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:23,441
And I said, if I did,

644
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:26,194
it would be
the inner thighs to test,

645
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:29,530
as that is where the epidermis
is at its most fine.

646
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:30,657
So we tested,

647
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,909
and it was the softest ever.

648
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:36,996
I wondered if perhaps they're
not equal in softitude.

649
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:38,748
Indeed they were not.

650
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:42,335
So I made sure to note it,
remembering which was which.

651
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:51,427
What of the tongue play
you were about to perform?

652
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:57,016
Is that not happening?

653
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:16,244
You...

654
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:20,039
You are troubled.

655
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:22,792
Did he lie with you?

656
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:25,253
No, we were against a wall.

657
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:27,755
Did you furious jump him?

658
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:28,965
No...

659
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:31,342
...he just fast-licked
my clitoris.

660
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:33,302
I had the heat
that needed release,

661
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:35,179
so at my request, it was.

662
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,768
You, too, may tongue play me,

663
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:45,690
so I'm not understanding
this complicated feeling.

664
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,486
Are you now crying?

665
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:02,832
What a confusing person
you are, Duncan Wedderburn.

666
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:04,417
A liver.

667
00:59:12,884 --> 00:59:16,637
Mm. A small incision

668
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:20,433
is all that is needed.

669
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,324
I was chloroforming goats
all morning.

670
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:38,993
I may have ingested too much.

671
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:41,079
I am going to venture
to suggest

672
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:43,998
you are upset
by Bella's absence.

673
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:45,792
The liters of port,

674
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:47,460
the sobbing I hear at night.

675
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:50,588
Good God, man!
You prattle like an imbecile.

676
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:52,006
She is gone!

677
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:55,301
I am a man of science.

678
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,596
I just need to engage in,
and continue, the project.

679
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,766
That is all. I must go on
to the next thing.

680
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:04,227
Our feelings
must be put aside.

681
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:07,939
Do you think my father
could have branded me

682
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,775
with hot irons on the genitals
the way he did

683
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:13,861
if he could not put
science and progress first?

684
01:00:13,945 --> 01:00:14,946
Branded you?

685
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:19,659
Let us find a body.

686
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:22,245
A... A what?

687
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:46,602
Hello. Good morning.

688
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,773
Good morning, darling.

689
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:58,406
I haven't been very supportive
of your adventurous spirit.

690
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:00,199
So I have a surprise for you.

691
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:09,750
Get in.

692
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:27,018
- We changed hotels?
- Look out the window, Bella.

693
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:40,698
- We're on boat?
- Indeed.

694
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:43,367
You aim to trap Bella at sea.

695
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:46,162
I aim to give you
a new adventure.

696
01:01:46,245 --> 01:01:48,915
I suppose it's true
you'll be easier to find.

697
01:01:48,998 --> 01:01:51,542
Come, disrobe me.

698
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:52,668
Ride me.

699
01:01:53,586 --> 01:01:56,047
And we'll then have
cocktails on foredeck.

700
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,025
Bella.

701
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:21,530
Bella.

702
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:26,619
Bella.

703
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:28,621
Bella!

704
01:02:29,622 --> 01:02:32,124
Blue. Blue. Blue.

705
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:13,192
Shit on me?

706
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:14,685
Fucker!

707
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:19,565
Madam.

708
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,860
When do we stop?

709
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:26,238
Athens. Three days.

710
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:56,519
That woman's on fire, look.

711
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:01,023
I know you're upset with me.

712
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:04,026
Forgive my kidnapping of you,
but it was for love.

713
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,404
A romantic jape.
Don't be such a cunt about it.

714
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,949
- I want a drink.
- Of course, my darling.

715
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:13,285
The ship is fun,
a whole world to explore.

716
01:05:14,203 --> 01:05:15,996
Do you love me? I love you.

717
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:19,375
Describe the elements
I should be looking for

718
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:21,293
within myself to be sure.

719
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:23,879
You just feel it or not.

720
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:27,591
So it is no evidence base,
as God would say.

721
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:29,885
So how judge it empirically?

722
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:32,138
What the fuck are you
talking about? Who are you?

723
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:33,764
You don't know
what bananas are,

724
01:05:33,848 --> 01:05:34,974
You've never heard of chess,

725
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:36,767
and Yet you know
what "empiricallY" means.

726
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:39,520
Bella wants a drink.
I said twice now.

727
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,148
I've never felt
anything like this.

728
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:43,607
Is this true for you?

729
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,361
I suppose, empirically it is.

730
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:52,867
I'm out of ink.

731
01:05:53,242 --> 01:05:54,243
Oh.

732
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,290
Then ink you shall have,
my love.

733
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:15,097
Hello,
interesting older lady.

734
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:16,807
I must touch Your hair.

735
01:06:19,268 --> 01:06:21,020
I also noticed your hair.

736
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:25,107
Just like silk on
a translucent, glowing egg.

737
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:28,152
That is fancy words
that excite me somehow.

738
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:31,155
I saw you're with
handsome over there.

739
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,449
White teeth and a hard cock.

740
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,118
Duncan Wedderburn.

741
01:06:36,202 --> 01:06:39,622
His teeth are also hard.
His penis is also white.

742
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:41,624
- Good lay, I hope.
- He is mY only.

743
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,877
But I find him to elicit
exceptional sensations

744
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,589
throughout my whole bodY
that leave me yelping happily.

745
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:52,593
I also wish to dash his body,
form, cadaver, into the sea.

746
01:06:53,219 --> 01:06:54,512
Is this man
jumping on your bodY?

747
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:56,430
No, he is not.

748
01:06:56,514 --> 01:06:58,599
I haven't been bedded
in 20 years.

749
01:06:58,682 --> 01:06:59,767
What?

750
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:01,560
That is terrible.

751
01:07:01,644 --> 01:07:03,562
It doesn't concern me greatly.

752
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:05,856
As years have passed,

753
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,526
what's in between my ears
is my big concern.

754
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:11,111
What's in between my legs...

755
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:13,656
much less so.

756
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:16,075
A desperate rationalization,
Martha.

757
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:18,452
Oh, this is Harry Astley.

758
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:21,664
Don't take what he says
too much to heart.

759
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,249
He's a cYnic.

760
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:24,917
Madam.

761
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:27,044
I am Bella Baxter.

762
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:30,506
I do not know
what this "cynic" is.

763
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:31,924
Bella.

764
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:33,008
Ink.

765
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:37,179
Duncan Wedderburn, I have made
friends, colleagues, comrades.

766
01:07:37,263 --> 01:07:38,806
Harry Astley.

767
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:40,474
This is Martha.

768
01:07:40,558 --> 01:07:43,769
She is my new friend who has
not been fucked in 20 years.

769
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:45,521
Is that not astonishment?

770
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:47,731
I hope you use your hand
between your legs

771
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:49,417
to keep Yourself happy.

772
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:52,903
Good God, Bella,
you cannot speak like this.

773
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:55,072
Polites of societY. I forgot.

774
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:56,657
Polite society

775
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,159
- will destroY you.
- It will?

776
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:00,679
Yeah, there...
there's some truth to that.

777
01:08:00,703 --> 01:08:02,538
We all agreed on that.

778
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,999
As to your enquiry on mY hand.

779
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:07,001
OccasionallY, yes.

780
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:09,461
That is much reassuring news.

781
01:08:10,296 --> 01:08:12,798
- We shall all dine together.
- Well, actually...

782
01:08:13,299 --> 01:08:15,593
We are all on a ship
and cannot escape,

783
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:18,721
and there is a world to enjoy,
traverse, circumnavigate.

784
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,765
Or can she not have friends,
Mr. Wedderburn?

785
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:24,018
Delighted.

786
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:28,480
Marry me.

787
01:08:28,564 --> 01:08:29,565
What?

788
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:31,025
I meant to throw you aside.

789
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,777
A few months and send you
packing, but I cannot.

790
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:34,862
SaY you'll marry me.

791
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:36,822
No one's ever captured
my heart. You have.

792
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:39,241
It is tricky,

793
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:41,785
as I am engaged
to Mr. Max McCandles.

794
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:44,079
What?

795
01:08:44,622 --> 01:08:47,124
MY hand has taken by another.

796
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,753
It is a saying I heard,
but did not understand.

797
01:08:50,836 --> 01:08:54,173
You do not take just the hand,
but all, do you not?

798
01:08:54,256 --> 01:08:56,925
You ran away with me from him.

799
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:58,135
A recounting of events,

800
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:00,304
the point of which
is elusive to me.

801
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:01,680
You chose me over him.

802
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:03,474
For now.

803
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:04,683
For fun.

804
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:07,519
I'll fucking throw you
overboard!

805
01:09:07,603 --> 01:09:10,564
So you wish to marry me
or kill me?

806
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:13,400
- Is that the proposal?
- No.

807
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:30,876
Going to the casino.

808
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:43,347
Uh, that's fine.

809
01:09:44,098 --> 01:09:45,265
She is coming along.

810
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:47,059
Let's try again.

811
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:51,063
Gross motor skills
will develop slowly,

812
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:53,982
but you will progress fast.

813
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:56,985
FelicitY.

814
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:02,157
Not that fast.

815
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:16,004
I am reading Emerson.

816
01:10:16,088 --> 01:10:18,465
He speaks about
the improvement of men.

817
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:21,760
I do not know why he does
not give advice to women.

818
01:10:21,844 --> 01:10:23,512
Perhaps he does not know anY.

819
01:10:24,555 --> 01:10:27,349
TrY and read Goethe.

820
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:30,060
Philosophy is a waste of time,
Bella.

821
01:10:30,144 --> 01:10:32,438
Really? Say more.

822
01:10:32,521 --> 01:10:34,440
No, no, Harry, you wretch.

823
01:10:34,523 --> 01:10:35,524
It is integral.

824
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:39,653
People and society
can be improved.

825
01:10:40,696 --> 01:10:42,698
It is the goal of all
to improve,

826
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:44,491
advance, progress, grow.

827
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:46,452
I know this in me,

828
01:10:46,535 --> 01:10:48,203
and I am sure
I am indicative of all.

829
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:52,332
Trust me, you are definitely
unique, Bella, in all ways.

830
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:56,086
But this improvement
through philosophy

831
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,504
is people trying to run away

832
01:10:57,588 --> 01:11:00,257
from the fact
that we are all cruel beasts.

833
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,676
Born that way, die that waY.

834
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:05,512
It is a dark view of things,
Harry.

835
01:11:05,888 --> 01:11:06,889
Bella...

836
01:11:08,182 --> 01:11:09,600
let us take the air...

837
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,770
in our cabin.

838
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:14,605
But these two are fighting,

839
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:17,566
and ideas are banging around
in Bella's head and heart

840
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:19,318
like lights in a storm.

841
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:20,611
Oh.

842
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:24,323
You're always
reading now, Bella.

843
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:28,494
You're losing some of
your adorable way of speaking.

844
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:30,245
I am
a changingable feast,

845
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,705
as are all of we.

846
01:11:31,789 --> 01:11:33,540
Apparently
according to Emerson,

847
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:34,708
disagreed with by Harry.

848
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:36,126
Come, come. Just come.

849
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:39,421
You are in my sun.

850
01:11:39,797 --> 01:11:41,048
What?

851
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:20,879
Come.

852
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:24,383
Mm-mm. Busy drinking heavily.

853
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,222
Busy losing heavily.

854
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,054
I must go meet Martha.

855
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:14,099
Martha.

856
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:16,602
She is the problem.

857
01:13:17,144 --> 01:13:20,814
I'll throw that perfumed bag
of flesh overboard.

858
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,025
I dare you.

859
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:34,912
Martha!

860
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:37,497
Where is she?

861
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:39,166
Where are you, fuck.

862
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:40,709
Where is she?

863
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:44,630
- Where are you going?
- She's going over the side.

864
01:13:44,713 --> 01:13:45,923
Oh, marvelous!

865
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:48,133
I never imagined
being murdered.

866
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:49,217
How dramatic.

867
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,136
Well, she seems happy to die.

868
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:52,638
I'm sorry
for getting in your way.

869
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:55,241
Oh!

870
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:56,892
Oh!

871
01:13:57,684 --> 01:13:59,895
Exciting.

872
01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:03,732
Oh... Whoa, whoa, whoa...

873
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:05,984
Oh! Ooh, ooh.

874
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:09,988
Oh. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...

875
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:11,990
Hyah.

876
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:19,206
I'll be in the bar.

877
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:55,659
You have
made me think, cogitate,

878
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:59,454
perambulate on ideas
that are wrong,

879
01:14:59,538 --> 01:15:02,708
erroneous
and nonsensically annoying

880
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,710
that lead me not to sleep.

881
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:05,877
So...

882
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:10,007
You say all are cruel.

883
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,718
And I disagree, disavow,

884
01:15:12,801 --> 01:15:13,885
and say no not.

885
01:15:15,137 --> 01:15:17,222
But when with Duncan,

886
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:19,808
the cruel
just bubbles up in me.

887
01:15:20,267 --> 01:15:21,768
That shows good judgment.

888
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:24,229
He is a pretty moron.

889
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:25,397
No.

890
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:27,691
I do not wish to be cruel.

891
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:31,486
I must improve
this aspect of myself.

892
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,238
You don't know the world.

893
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:34,865
And you fear it.

894
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:38,869
I do not fear it.

895
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:41,496
Do you want to see
what the world is really like?

896
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:42,914
I'll show you.

897
01:15:43,665 --> 01:15:44,666
Yes.

898
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,334
Of course.

899
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:34,257
Do you hear that?

900
01:16:37,886 --> 01:16:38,887
What is it?

901
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:02,244
- Lot of dead babies.
- Oh.

902
01:17:02,828 --> 01:17:04,037
Must be hot.

903
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:07,207
We must go help them.

904
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,626
How will we do that?

905
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,797
We go down there,

906
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:17,509
they'll quite rightfullY
rope us, rob us, and rape us.

907
01:17:17,592 --> 01:17:19,803
And if they were here
and we were there,

908
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:21,805
we'd do the same to them.

909
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:27,310
Bella.

910
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:29,187
Bella.

911
01:17:30,147 --> 01:17:32,274
Bella.

912
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,043
We are casting off, ma'am.

913
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:17,045
But I have to go back.

914
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:21,925
I... I must give this money
to the poor near the hotel,

915
01:19:22,008 --> 01:19:23,635
in what they call a slum.

916
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:26,304
We're staying ashore, ma'am.

917
01:19:27,264 --> 01:19:28,723
We could take care
of that for you.

918
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:31,226
- You can?
- Of course.

919
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:33,436
It is generous of you.

920
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,105
They need moneY.

921
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:36,815
Everyone does.

922
01:19:42,487 --> 01:19:43,530
Thank you.

923
01:20:00,714 --> 01:20:02,424
You! Get me the captain.

924
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:04,134
Now we'll find
this fucking thief.

925
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:05,218
Bella!

926
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:07,971
We've been robbed!

927
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:10,223
I... I won.

928
01:20:10,307 --> 01:20:11,850
I won everything

929
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:13,476
like never before.

930
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,812
And now it's gone.

931
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:17,689
You've not been robbed.

932
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:19,607
- I took it.
- For what?

933
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:21,234
I took it.

934
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:24,446
I'm so tired.

935
01:20:26,448 --> 01:20:28,742
Or maybe just my spirit is.

936
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:32,245
My soul has been buckled,
crumpled,

937
01:20:32,746 --> 01:20:35,290
flattened, Duncan Wedderburn,

938
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:37,667
by the sights I have seen.

939
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,189
So, no need
for the captain then, sir?

940
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:43,691
Fuck off before
I break all your teeth.

941
01:20:45,759 --> 01:20:46,885
Indeed, sir.

942
01:20:50,597 --> 01:20:51,639
Where is it?

943
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:53,975
You hid it for safetY.

944
01:20:54,059 --> 01:20:56,353
I was drunk and foolishly
left it everywhere.

945
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:57,437
What a relief.

946
01:20:58,146 --> 01:20:59,898
I did not hide it.

947
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:04,069
I gave it to those poor people
out there.

948
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:07,781
Money is its own form
of sickness,

949
01:21:08,323 --> 01:21:09,949
and all the scarcity of it.

950
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:12,911
And who am I,

951
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,580
lying in a feather bed,

952
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:18,333
while dead babies

953
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,293
lie in a ditch?

954
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:23,296
Duncan.

955
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:26,841
You what?

956
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:31,513
I am expecting
a hug of solace.

957
01:21:32,389 --> 01:21:33,390
You...

958
01:21:33,473 --> 01:21:36,059
I need to offer something
to the world.

959
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:38,478
And yet I have nothing.

960
01:21:39,813 --> 01:21:41,022
Except some money.

961
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:45,735
It is a bad day
for Bella Baxter.

962
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:50,115
Where is my fucking money?

963
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:51,491
I just told you.

964
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:54,327
I gave it away to the poor.

965
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:58,081
I thought
I told you to fuck off!

966
01:21:58,164 --> 01:22:00,542
The steward informs me

967
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:02,293
that you may not have
sufficient funds

968
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:03,670
to make good
Your account, sir.

969
01:22:04,379 --> 01:22:06,099
- Well, I...
- That is probably true.

970
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:08,925
I gave it all to some nice men

971
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:11,302
to pass on

972
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:13,847
to the slum poor.

973
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:16,141
You'll be put ashore
at the next port

974
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:18,685
and confined to crew's rations
until then, sir.

975
01:22:18,768 --> 01:22:20,520
- Good evening.
- How dare you?

976
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:35,076
"Dead, blind babies

977
01:22:36,536 --> 01:22:37,871
"bit Harry.

978
01:22:39,706 --> 01:22:41,458
"My mouth

979
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:44,919
"was full of blood."

980
01:22:46,296 --> 01:22:47,422
Poor Bella.

981
01:22:49,257 --> 01:22:50,550
She is a ruin.

982
01:22:55,722 --> 01:22:57,474
- How's your hand?
- It's fine.

983
01:22:58,016 --> 01:22:59,142
I'm sorry.

984
01:22:59,225 --> 01:23:01,019
You were trying
to help me understand.

985
01:23:01,102 --> 01:23:03,646
No. I actually
wanted to hurt you.

986
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:05,857
Couldn't bear to see

987
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,860
such dumb, beautiful happiness
in someone.

988
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,612
It was cruel of me.

989
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:12,489
I am not sorry.

990
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,283
If I know the world,
I can improve it.

991
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:16,493
You can't.

992
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:18,411
That is the real point.

993
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:20,622
Don't accept the lie
of religion,

994
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:21,706
socialism,

995
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,374
capitalism.

996
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,502
We are a fucked species.

997
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:27,962
Know it. Hope is smashable.

998
01:23:28,046 --> 01:23:29,255
Realism is not.

999
01:23:29,756 --> 01:23:31,466
Protect yourself
with the truth.

1000
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:35,386
I realize
what you are now, Harry.

1001
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,638
Just a broken little boy

1002
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:38,598
who cannot bear
the pain of the world.

1003
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:41,684
I suppose so.

1004
01:23:50,902 --> 01:23:52,028
Goodbye, Harry.

1005
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,947
We get thrown off
in Marseille.

1006
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:56,241
WhY do you stay with him?

1007
01:23:56,866 --> 01:23:58,368
I always think
it will be better.

1008
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:01,412
'Course you do.

1009
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:20,515
I have heard great things
of the beauty of Paris.

1010
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:26,479
I'll fucking kick
Your dog to death.

1011
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:30,900
Fucking...

1012
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:33,027
Paris with no money.

1013
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:35,196
What do you suggest
we do, Bella?

1014
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,531
I will get us a hotel.

1015
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:37,657
Do not worry.

1016
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,867
Uh-huh. With what?
We have no money.

1017
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:44,289
Is it not
an interesting experiment?

1018
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:45,373
We have nothing.

1019
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,001
- How will we live now?
- I don't know!

1020
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:50,003
Exactly,
that is the experiment.

1021
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,629
We are now the poor.

1022
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:55,216
Also, many adventurers
have faced these odds.

1023
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,135
Robinson Crusoe, for example.

1024
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:00,263
Selfish, thoughtless,
careless bitch.

1025
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:02,724
I'm not thoughtless, Duncan.

1026
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:04,767
And while it is true
my ability

1027
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:08,021
to think things through to
the logical conclusions is not

1028
01:25:08,646 --> 01:25:09,772
strong,

1029
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:12,233
I did help
those suffering people.

1030
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:13,651
I have ruined us,

1031
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:15,361
as you pointed out,

1032
01:25:15,903 --> 01:25:18,156
but I do believe my actions
come from a good place.

1033
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:20,408
Shut the fuck up.

1034
01:25:21,326 --> 01:25:22,660
I will get us a hotel.

1035
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,542
Good afternoon, madam.

1036
01:25:29,626 --> 01:25:32,754
Good day, my fresh,
darling English Rose.

1037
01:25:33,755 --> 01:25:34,756
Is this a hotel?

1038
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:36,090
We have rooms.

1039
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:37,759
Are You looking for work?

1040
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:39,093
How much is a room?

1041
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:41,346
I'll charge you
10 francs an hour.

1042
01:25:41,429 --> 01:25:43,556
You charge them 30.

1043
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,766
Everyone's happy.

1044
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:46,392
I see.

1045
01:25:46,893 --> 01:25:48,311
<i>Monsieur</i> Chapelle.

1046
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:49,479
Fresh from London.

1047
01:25:50,647 --> 01:25:52,023
<i>Enchanté.</i> Hello.

1048
01:25:55,902 --> 01:25:57,028
<i>Merci.</i>

1049
01:25:58,237 --> 01:25:59,405
So, off you go.

1050
01:25:59,906 --> 01:26:01,407
At this point, I am confused.

1051
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:03,326
You're not here to work?

1052
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:04,661
Oh, come on.

1053
01:26:04,744 --> 01:26:07,288
Lie with him,
let him cock you a bit

1054
01:26:07,372 --> 01:26:08,790
and make some nice francs.

1055
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:10,166
I see.

1056
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:12,043
He would paY me for this?

1057
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:13,586
Yes.

1058
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:15,672
If you need money,

1059
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:17,840
it is the shortest route
to it.

1060
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:21,719
I have never been cocked
by another man,

1061
01:26:22,387 --> 01:26:23,846
and yet have wondered on that.

1062
01:26:24,764 --> 01:26:26,140
And am in need of funds.

1063
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,104
It is, I believe,
a confluence of circumstances

1064
01:26:31,187 --> 01:26:33,189
I regard as almost fate-like.

1065
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:34,982
Let us do this.

1066
01:26:37,694 --> 01:26:38,945
Room 16.

1067
01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:17,775
What is your name?

1068
01:27:25,867 --> 01:27:27,034
Mysterious.

1069
01:27:54,812 --> 01:27:57,356
Should we warm me up
a bit...

1070
01:27:57,982 --> 01:27:59,108
Oh.

1071
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,465
<i>Merci.</i>

1072
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:30,348
Good day, sir.

1073
01:28:30,848 --> 01:28:32,308
<i>Éclair au chocolat?</i>

1074
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:36,187
I've come into some moneY
and some enlightenment.

1075
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:38,105
You stole it?

1076
01:28:38,564 --> 01:28:41,317
You've always said you're
the best bedman in the world,

1077
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:43,110
and I have never
known another,

1078
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:45,321
so I knew not
whether this was true.

1079
01:28:45,905 --> 01:28:47,114
But now I do.

1080
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:48,991
And he was terrible

1081
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:52,578
and made ungodly noises
as he thrust himself into me.

1082
01:28:52,662 --> 01:28:55,039
And a mere three thrusts,
Duncan Wedderburn,

1083
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:56,290
was all he could manage.

1084
01:28:56,624 --> 01:28:58,000
I stifled a laugh,

1085
01:28:58,084 --> 01:29:00,002
out of polites, of course.

1086
01:29:00,086 --> 01:29:02,213
I took his moneY.
I thanked him.

1087
01:29:02,296 --> 01:29:04,799
I laughed all the way
to buy us these éclairs,

1088
01:29:04,882 --> 01:29:05,967
and I thought so fondly,

1089
01:29:06,884 --> 01:29:09,554
remembering the fierce
sweaty nights of ours.

1090
01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:12,682
You fucked for money?

1091
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:14,475
And as an experiment.

1092
01:29:15,268 --> 01:29:17,103
And it is good
for our relationship

1093
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:19,355
as it gladdens my heart
toward you.

1094
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:20,815
My heart has been a bit dim

1095
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:23,234
on your weepy,
sweary person lately.

1096
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:27,613
You are a monster.
A whore and a monster.

1097
01:29:27,697 --> 01:29:29,198
A demon sent from hell

1098
01:29:29,282 --> 01:29:30,992
to rip my spirit to shreds.

1099
01:29:31,075 --> 01:29:33,995
To punish my tiny sins

1100
01:29:34,078 --> 01:29:35,830
with a tsunami of destruction.

1101
01:29:35,913 --> 01:29:37,707
To take my heart
and pull it like taffy

1102
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:38,791
to ruin me.

1103
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:40,751
I look at you, and I see
nothing but ugliness.

1104
01:29:42,295 --> 01:29:45,339
That last bit was uncalled for
and makes no sense,

1105
01:29:45,423 --> 01:29:48,134
as your odes to my beautY
have been boring

1106
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:49,260
but constant.

1107
01:29:49,844 --> 01:29:52,096
And the simple act

1108
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:54,807
of letting a strange man
ride on me

1109
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:55,892
has erased all that?

1110
01:29:58,269 --> 01:29:59,353
Fuck!

1111
01:29:59,437 --> 01:30:01,480
You whored yourself.

1112
01:30:02,023 --> 01:30:04,233
Which you are now going
to explain to me is bad.

1113
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:05,860
Can I never win with you?

1114
01:30:05,943 --> 01:30:08,738
It is the worst thing
women can do.

1115
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:11,949
We should definitely
never marry.

1116
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:15,077
I am a flawed,
experimenting person

1117
01:30:15,161 --> 01:30:18,039
and I will need a husband with
a more forgiving disposition.

1118
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:20,082
Cunt!

1119
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:21,751
I can now see
you are not that.

1120
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:23,961
Our adventure is clearly over.

1121
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:26,631
I shall book you
a passage back to London.

1122
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:28,507
You had moneY

1123
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:30,217
this whole time?

1124
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:31,677
It is God's money.

1125
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:33,846
For emergencies.

1126
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:36,349
It has been a fucking
emergency for weeks now!

1127
01:30:36,432 --> 01:30:38,225
I believed in you
the whole time,

1128
01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:40,353
that you would rise
to the occasion.

1129
01:30:40,811 --> 01:30:42,355
But now I see
that was a mistake,

1130
01:30:42,438 --> 01:30:44,190
and there's clearly
something broken in you.

1131
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:46,442
You broke
that something in me!

1132
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:48,945
I feel this conversation
has become circular.

1133
01:30:49,028 --> 01:30:51,405
Cunt!

1134
01:30:57,662 --> 01:31:00,081
Madam Swiney,
I have examined my situation.

1135
01:31:00,164 --> 01:31:01,749
I need sex and money.

1136
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:03,542
I could take a lover,

1137
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:05,461
another Wedderburn
who would keep me

1138
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:07,713
but may require
an awful lot of attention.

1139
01:31:07,797 --> 01:31:09,590
Or else
it's 20 minutes at a time,

1140
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:11,884
and the rest of my day
is free to study on the world

1141
01:31:11,968 --> 01:31:13,135
and the improvement of it.

1142
01:31:13,678 --> 01:31:16,097
Hence, I seek employment

1143
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,890
at your musty-smelling
establishment

1144
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:19,100
of good-time fornication.

1145
01:31:19,183 --> 01:31:22,228
A woman plotting
her course to freedom.

1146
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:24,438
How delightful.

1147
01:31:25,231 --> 01:31:26,232
Come.

1148
01:31:29,777 --> 01:31:31,988
Ah, <i>Monsieur</i> Saveur.

1149
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:34,782
A filet mignon.

1150
01:31:35,366 --> 01:31:37,284
A prime cut.

1151
01:31:37,618 --> 01:31:38,661
<i>Merci.</i>

1152
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:51,590
Bella.

1153
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:55,011
Say <i>"formidable"</i> at the end.

1154
01:31:55,094 --> 01:31:56,137
House rules.

1155
01:32:25,124 --> 01:32:26,667
Is that smell you?

1156
01:33:01,494 --> 01:33:02,578
<i>Formidable.</i>

1157
01:33:03,412 --> 01:33:04,413
<i>Merci.</i>

1158
01:33:15,549 --> 01:33:16,717
For the smell.

1159
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,678
And tea.
Just because tea is nice.

1160
01:33:21,889 --> 01:33:22,890
<i>Merci.</i>

1161
01:33:23,766 --> 01:33:24,975
It was brutal

1162
01:33:25,476 --> 01:33:26,936
in a strangely
not unpleasant way.

1163
01:33:31,065 --> 01:33:32,983
Pamphlet.

1164
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:34,693
- Read.
- What is that?

1165
01:33:34,777 --> 01:33:35,778
<i>Une personne qui veut...</i>

1166
01:33:35,861 --> 01:33:37,488
Change the world.

1167
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:39,448
Make it better.
A better world.

1168
01:33:40,491 --> 01:33:42,201
Then I am that too.

1169
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:54,505
Madam SwineY,

1170
01:33:54,588 --> 01:33:56,382
this lineup system,

1171
01:33:56,465 --> 01:33:58,342
you really expect me
to go upstairs with a man

1172
01:33:58,425 --> 01:34:00,052
even if I find him distasteful

1173
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:02,388
and therefore am sad

1174
01:34:02,471 --> 01:34:03,931
when I let him
furious jump me?

1175
01:34:04,014 --> 01:34:06,517
That is the way it is,
my darling.

1176
01:34:09,603 --> 01:34:11,147
Gosh, you look pretty.

1177
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:13,399
How it agrees with you
to be ravaged.

1178
01:34:14,275 --> 01:34:15,276
I suppose so.

1179
01:34:15,776 --> 01:34:17,111
<i>Oui.</i>

1180
01:34:17,194 --> 01:34:19,113
<i>Oui, monsieur Mersault.</i>
Bella.

1181
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:22,533
So, would you not prefer it
if the women chose,

1182
01:34:22,992 --> 01:34:25,536
as it would be a sign
of enthusiasm toward you?

1183
01:34:25,911 --> 01:34:27,663
Um, you wouldn't have
the vague sense

1184
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:29,081
that they are
in a state of horror

1185
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:30,166
when You jump them.

1186
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:37,006
Bella is new
and may have a mental illness.

1187
01:34:41,135 --> 01:34:42,636
As God, my father, says,

1188
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:45,806
it is only the way it is until
we discover the new way it is,

1189
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:47,033
and then that is the way it is

1190
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:48,601
until we discover
the new way it is,

1191
01:34:48,684 --> 01:34:50,936
and so it goes until the world
is no longer flat,

1192
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,438
electricity lights the night,

1193
01:34:52,521 --> 01:34:54,124
and shoes are no longer
tied with ribbons.

1194
01:34:55,316 --> 01:34:57,116
As a socialist,
I agree entirely.

1195
01:34:57,193 --> 01:34:58,194
<i>Formidable.</i>

1196
01:34:58,277 --> 01:35:00,654
Toinette, you have such
a clever mouth.

1197
01:35:01,197 --> 01:35:04,033
<i>Monsieur</i> Mersault
will enjoY it for free.

1198
01:35:04,617 --> 01:35:06,202
Go. Now.

1199
01:35:06,911 --> 01:35:09,330
Bella, a moment in my office.

1200
01:35:11,457 --> 01:35:14,168
You have the most
delicious looking lobes.

1201
01:35:15,252 --> 01:35:16,253
Thank you.

1202
01:35:16,337 --> 01:35:17,421
I must...

1203
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:23,093
Oh, I am sorry. I drew blood.

1204
01:35:23,928 --> 01:35:24,970
Here.

1205
01:35:27,556 --> 01:35:29,683
I sometimes give in to myself

1206
01:35:29,767 --> 01:35:31,852
when I see beauty,
young beautY.

1207
01:35:31,936 --> 01:35:33,479
For one day, my dear,

1208
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:36,774
you will be a wrinkled,
old husk.

1209
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:39,276
And no one will want you
either to pay you for it

1210
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,278
or to have it for free.

1211
01:35:41,946 --> 01:35:44,615
I still believe everyone would
be happier if we could choose.

1212
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:46,200
An idealist.

1213
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:47,743
Like me.

1214
01:35:48,202 --> 01:35:50,579
How delightful you are.

1215
01:35:50,663 --> 01:35:53,332
But we must give in
to the demands

1216
01:35:53,415 --> 01:35:55,000
of the world sometimes.

1217
01:35:55,084 --> 01:35:56,877
Grapple with it,
try to defeat it.

1218
01:35:56,961 --> 01:35:59,338
- So you believe as me?
- Of course.

1219
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:03,634
But some men enjoy
that you do not like it.

1220
01:36:03,717 --> 01:36:04,718
What?

1221
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:07,471
- That is...
- Sick.

1222
01:36:07,554 --> 01:36:09,306
But good business.

1223
01:36:09,974 --> 01:36:11,225
Come with me.

1224
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:17,606
My grandchild.

1225
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:21,819
Sick and poorlY,
and requiring much doctoring.

1226
01:36:21,902 --> 01:36:26,657
My choice of giving you choice
will jeopardize the business.

1227
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,450
Her health. Her life.

1228
01:36:28,534 --> 01:36:30,953
- Do you want that, Bella?
- Of course not.

1229
01:36:31,036 --> 01:36:32,830
You don't? You're so lovely.

1230
01:36:34,999 --> 01:36:36,625
I thought you were going
for mY lobes.

1231
01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:39,920
We must work.

1232
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:43,132
We must make money.

1233
01:36:43,215 --> 01:36:46,552
But more than that,
we must experience everything,

1234
01:36:46,635 --> 01:36:48,012
not just the good.

1235
01:36:48,095 --> 01:36:51,348
But degradation,
horror, sadness...

1236
01:36:51,432 --> 01:36:53,976
This makes us whole, Bella.

1237
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:56,270
Makes us people of substance,

1238
01:36:56,353 --> 01:36:58,647
not flighty,
untouched children.

1239
01:37:00,024 --> 01:37:01,775
Then we can know the world.

1240
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:04,862
And when we know the world,

1241
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:07,114
the world is ours.

1242
01:37:08,115 --> 01:37:09,241
I want that.

1243
01:37:09,992 --> 01:37:11,535
Now,

1244
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,495
go and fuck someone

1245
01:37:13,579 --> 01:37:15,956
and bring me 10 francs.

1246
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,588
First, I suggest a short quiz.

1247
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,381
A quiz?

1248
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:26,842
You tell me
a childhood memory.

1249
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,097
Then I tell a joke.
<i>Toc toc.</i>

1250
01:37:32,598 --> 01:37:34,308
Then a quick sniff,

1251
01:37:34,391 --> 01:37:37,644
and if necessarY,
a quick douse in lavender oil.

1252
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:40,647
And all of this
will enhance the experience,

1253
01:37:40,731 --> 01:37:42,232
making it <i>formidable.</i>

1254
01:37:42,316 --> 01:37:43,317
<i>Toc toc.</i>

1255
01:37:44,026 --> 01:37:45,027
<i>Toc toc.</i>

1256
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:47,363
<i>Non,</i> I tell the joke.

1257
01:37:47,446 --> 01:37:48,697
You the memory.

1258
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:51,075
- Mm.
<i>- Le souvenir.</i>

1259
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:01,126
When you were
little in Greece,

1260
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:02,920
you fell from your bicycle?

1261
01:38:03,003 --> 01:38:04,088
<i>Oui.</i>

1262
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:06,965
Mm.

1263
01:38:09,676 --> 01:38:11,011
Blood.
Down my leg.

1264
01:38:11,095 --> 01:38:12,096
Mm.

1265
01:38:14,598 --> 01:38:16,558
<i>"Joie."</i> Joy?

1266
01:38:16,642 --> 01:38:18,227
You watched the blood
with joy.

1267
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:20,020
<i>- Oui.</i>
- Knock, knock.

1268
01:38:20,854 --> 01:38:22,439
<i>- Qui c'est?
- Fromage.</i>

1269
01:38:22,773 --> 01:38:23,774
<i>Fromage qui?</i>

1270
01:38:24,233 --> 01:38:25,442
Cheese to meet you.

1271
01:38:36,203 --> 01:38:37,287
You know it.

1272
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:42,876
You smell okay.

1273
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:43,961
Let us fuck.

1274
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:31,967
God gave you a gift,
my friend.

1275
01:40:12,799 --> 01:40:14,843
Very inelegant work.

1276
01:40:15,219 --> 01:40:16,845
This is what You do
when you're homesick?

1277
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:32,903
You wish what?

1278
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:35,948
My boys are of an age
for education. Sexual.

1279
01:40:37,616 --> 01:40:38,700
I will demonstrate.

1280
01:40:39,535 --> 01:40:40,536
I see.

1281
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,211
At times.

1282
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:06,019
Shall I lay,
bend, astride?

1283
01:41:06,895 --> 01:41:08,535
- Let's start simple, please.
- Mm.

1284
01:41:42,848 --> 01:41:44,308
To aid things along,

1285
01:41:44,391 --> 01:41:46,226
- a finger in the arse.
- No.

1286
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:48,353
Or a slight choking maY do it.

1287
01:42:16,298 --> 01:42:18,383
Go home!

1288
01:42:25,223 --> 01:42:26,725
Bella!

1289
01:42:27,893 --> 01:42:29,603
Madam SwineY was right.

1290
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:32,606
I am discovering parts
of myself hitherto unknown.

1291
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:34,232
It is a way to look at it.

1292
01:42:34,983 --> 01:42:38,195
The variety of desires being
made manifest is fascinating.

1293
01:42:38,278 --> 01:42:39,321
Have you had the man

1294
01:42:39,404 --> 01:42:41,007
who puts a wedge of pineapple
in your mouth

1295
01:42:41,031 --> 01:42:42,032
and covers you in dust?

1296
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:44,701
Bella.

1297
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:47,537
I'm almost ready
to forgive you.

1298
01:42:47,704 --> 01:42:48,955
I've booked our berths home,

1299
01:42:49,122 --> 01:42:51,667
and I've told Mother
to prepare our wedding bed.

1300
01:42:52,793 --> 01:42:54,544
Did you fuck that guy
with hooks for hands?

1301
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:56,171
You did. I know!

1302
01:42:56,922 --> 01:42:59,383
I beat the tar
out of that guy.

1303
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:01,426
Duncan. I thought you left.

1304
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:03,929
Back to the ship,
but started to ache and vomit,

1305
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:05,430
so I'm here to save you.

1306
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:06,807
Hello, Duncan.

1307
01:43:10,102 --> 01:43:11,311
Go home, Duncan.

1308
01:43:11,478 --> 01:43:12,938
Our time has ended.

1309
01:43:13,105 --> 01:43:14,207
I look at you and feel nothing

1310
01:43:14,231 --> 01:43:16,334
but the lingering question
of how did I ever want you?

1311
01:43:16,358 --> 01:43:17,359
Oh...

1312
01:43:17,442 --> 01:43:19,194
And we must go
to the meeting of socialists.

1313
01:43:21,988 --> 01:43:23,281
You're whores.

1314
01:43:23,365 --> 01:43:25,742
We are our own means
of production.

1315
01:43:25,826 --> 01:43:26,910
Go away.

1316
01:43:39,548 --> 01:43:40,549
Foot.

1317
01:43:42,551 --> 01:43:43,885
Paint, foot.

1318
01:43:43,969 --> 01:43:44,970
Very good.

1319
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:50,851
Language is slow
but improving.

1320
01:43:50,934 --> 01:43:52,018
Paint. Foot.

1321
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:53,103
Genius.

1322
01:43:53,979 --> 01:43:56,022
Can you not be
so cruel to her?

1323
01:43:56,106 --> 01:43:57,649
I made a mistake with Bella.

1324
01:43:57,733 --> 01:43:59,609
I allowed feelings to develop.

1325
01:44:00,402 --> 01:44:01,611
There are none for her.

1326
01:44:01,695 --> 01:44:04,114
She is no different
to the chicken dog.

1327
01:44:04,197 --> 01:44:05,198
Foot.

1328
01:44:05,282 --> 01:44:07,284
It is better
this way, perhaps,

1329
01:44:07,367 --> 01:44:10,537
and gives some insight into
my father's coolness to me.

1330
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:13,331
It was a necessitY of science.

1331
01:44:13,415 --> 01:44:14,583
Good God, man.

1332
01:44:14,666 --> 01:44:16,418
- Foot.
- I do not expect You

1333
01:44:16,501 --> 01:44:18,628
to understand, village doctor.

1334
01:44:19,963 --> 01:44:22,424
By the way,
I need you to operate on me.

1335
01:44:22,966 --> 01:44:25,135
Shall I put a beating heart
in your monstrous form?

1336
01:44:26,052 --> 01:44:27,304
If you have time

1337
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:29,389
while taking...

1338
01:44:31,391 --> 01:44:32,476
this out.

1339
01:44:50,035 --> 01:44:52,746
I'll remove some cYsts
from around the tumor.

1340
01:44:52,829 --> 01:44:55,373
No need. You may close me up.

1341
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:58,752
It has spread.
I see tinY polyps.

1342
01:45:01,963 --> 01:45:03,340
I am dying.

1343
01:45:03,423 --> 01:45:06,218
How to break it
to the patient, eh?

1344
01:45:06,635 --> 01:45:07,761
Baxter...

1345
01:45:07,844 --> 01:45:08,929
Do not cry into the wound!

1346
01:45:09,012 --> 01:45:10,680
You'll kill me faster
with sepsis.

1347
01:45:11,306 --> 01:45:12,307
Quiet now.

1348
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:13,809
And close me up.

1349
01:45:15,519 --> 01:45:16,895
Find her.

1350
01:45:22,234 --> 01:45:23,819
I am closed.

1351
01:45:31,076 --> 01:45:32,953
Hot chocolate,
my dear.

1352
01:45:33,036 --> 01:45:35,121
And <i>pain au chocolat.</i>

1353
01:45:43,588 --> 01:45:44,673
You are my favorite.

1354
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,636
I have heard you say that
to the others.

1355
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:51,471
We are a machine You feed

1356
01:45:51,555 --> 01:45:53,223
with compliments
and chocolate.

1357
01:45:53,306 --> 01:45:55,475
You are my children
I feed with love.

1358
01:46:02,232 --> 01:46:05,151
Something terrible
has happened, Swiney.

1359
01:46:05,777 --> 01:46:07,737
I feel almost nothing.

1360
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:12,492
My empathy is creeping
toward what I would describe

1361
01:46:12,659 --> 01:46:14,786
as contemptuous rage.

1362
01:46:14,953 --> 01:46:16,580
This is fabulous.

1363
01:46:16,663 --> 01:46:17,664
It is?

1364
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:22,711
You're in the dark period.

1365
01:46:23,587 --> 01:46:26,506
Before light and wisdom
come to you.

1366
01:46:27,883 --> 01:46:29,718
You must forge through it,

1367
01:46:30,635 --> 01:46:32,178
and once on the other side,

1368
01:46:32,846 --> 01:46:34,598
you will be grateful
to this moment,

1369
01:46:34,681 --> 01:46:36,850
but you must keep going.

1370
01:46:36,933 --> 01:46:37,976
I see.

1371
01:47:54,052 --> 01:47:55,470
You've got a baby scar.

1372
01:47:58,390 --> 01:47:59,683
Mine is with <i>ma maman.</i>

1373
01:48:01,977 --> 01:48:03,144
I don't have one.

1374
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:06,898
It is an accident scar.

1375
01:48:06,982 --> 01:48:09,317
But you're not the first
to have made the mistake.

1376
01:48:09,401 --> 01:48:10,485
Why lie?

1377
01:48:11,444 --> 01:48:12,612
I'm not lying.

1378
01:48:13,363 --> 01:48:15,115
MY Godwin told me himself.

1379
01:48:33,049 --> 01:48:34,175
Wedderburn.

1380
01:48:59,325 --> 01:49:00,452
Good day, sir.

1381
01:49:04,914 --> 01:49:06,833
You wrote
to Mr. Godwin Baxter.

1382
01:49:07,292 --> 01:49:09,461
He has sent a demon
at large into the world.

1383
01:49:09,544 --> 01:49:11,588
The devil's wrapped
in an alluring body

1384
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:12,964
that cannot be satiated,

1385
01:49:13,048 --> 01:49:16,217
and a mind that picks
people apart stitch by stitch

1386
01:49:16,301 --> 01:49:18,386
like a bloodied
and burned rag doll

1387
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:19,763
shat out
of an elephant's arse.

1388
01:49:19,846 --> 01:49:20,847
Bella.

1389
01:49:21,598 --> 01:49:22,682
Where is she?

1390
01:49:22,766 --> 01:49:23,808
Who are you?

1391
01:49:23,892 --> 01:49:25,643
I'm her fiancé, sir.

1392
01:49:29,814 --> 01:49:32,525
Obviously, things did not
end well between you.

1393
01:49:32,609 --> 01:49:33,651
Did not?

1394
01:49:34,444 --> 01:49:35,862
She destroYed me.

1395
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:38,782
Well, we're all masters
of our own ship, sir.

1396
01:49:38,865 --> 01:49:39,866
There's that.

1397
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:43,244
I do not like you
or your words.

1398
01:49:43,328 --> 01:49:44,662
That Godwin Baxter.

1399
01:49:44,746 --> 01:49:46,831
He knew,
and he set her on to me.

1400
01:49:46,915 --> 01:49:47,916
He trapped me.

1401
01:49:49,834 --> 01:49:50,835
Where is she?

1402
01:49:50,919 --> 01:49:53,671
Would not wish her
on my worst enemy.

1403
01:49:55,590 --> 01:49:58,134
I shall save you
from her, sir.

1404
01:50:11,773 --> 01:50:14,442
Forgive my frustration.
Just tell me.

1405
01:50:14,526 --> 01:50:16,069
It does not hurt.

1406
01:50:16,152 --> 01:50:18,488
I have no insides.

1407
01:50:18,571 --> 01:50:20,448
She hollowed me out.

1408
01:50:20,532 --> 01:50:22,909
My soul. My bank account!

1409
01:50:23,451 --> 01:50:24,744
I am a bug! A shell!

1410
01:50:24,911 --> 01:50:25,912
Shall we sing?

1411
01:50:25,995 --> 01:50:28,331
<i>Oh, we are sailors...</i>

1412
01:50:28,414 --> 01:50:30,166
It doesn't...

1413
01:50:31,334 --> 01:50:32,752
Doesn't hurt.

1414
01:50:34,879 --> 01:50:36,714
I do not wish it
to be like this.

1415
01:50:38,091 --> 01:50:39,259
You force mY hand.

1416
01:50:39,342 --> 01:50:41,970
"We're all masters
of our own ship."

1417
01:50:42,053 --> 01:50:44,889
You cunting
cunt-faced deadshit.

1418
01:50:45,348 --> 01:50:46,349
Please.

1419
01:50:46,432 --> 01:50:48,184
I ask you
as politely as I can.

1420
01:50:48,268 --> 01:50:50,186
Where is she?

1421
01:51:02,657 --> 01:51:03,658
<i>Merci.</i>

1422
01:51:46,576 --> 01:51:48,286
The whore is back.

1423
01:51:53,499 --> 01:51:55,210
- God?
- Bella!

1424
01:51:55,877 --> 01:51:57,378
Max wrote me.

1425
01:51:57,837 --> 01:51:59,964
- You are ill?
- I am not. I am dying.

1426
01:52:00,048 --> 01:52:01,049
A subtle difference,

1427
01:52:01,132 --> 01:52:03,927
but one I take seriously
as a physician.

1428
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:05,720
You are a sight
and a good one.

1429
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:06,804
You cannot die.

1430
01:52:06,888 --> 01:52:09,057
Empirical data says different.

1431
01:52:10,308 --> 01:52:11,309
I m issed You.

1432
01:52:12,644 --> 01:52:15,563
I now have to lie down.

1433
01:52:21,778 --> 01:52:23,529
It is not all sunshine
I bring.

1434
01:52:25,156 --> 01:52:27,867
I also bring beady eyes
and hard questions.

1435
01:52:29,577 --> 01:52:31,079
Did I have a baby in me?

1436
01:52:31,996 --> 01:52:33,206
And if so, where is it?

1437
01:52:33,581 --> 01:52:34,666
I see.

1438
01:52:35,625 --> 01:52:39,420
Well, technically,
you are your babY.

1439
01:52:39,504 --> 01:52:42,298
And also, I suppose
you are your mother.

1440
01:52:42,382 --> 01:52:44,300
And also neither.

1441
01:52:44,384 --> 01:52:46,261
No memory survives.

1442
01:52:46,344 --> 01:52:47,971
No experiences survive.

1443
01:52:49,013 --> 01:52:51,057
What do you mean
I am mother and daughter?

1444
01:53:09,242 --> 01:53:10,785
You knew and did not tell.

1445
01:53:11,244 --> 01:53:14,038
I... did not see
good reason to.

1446
01:53:14,122 --> 01:53:15,373
And were too cowardly to.

1447
01:53:15,456 --> 01:53:17,125
A bit of that as well.

1448
01:53:18,626 --> 01:53:20,128
I wanted to be with you,

1449
01:53:20,628 --> 01:53:22,964
and I was not sure
you would even understand.

1450
01:53:23,047 --> 01:53:26,551
And Baxter kind of makes one
a prisoner to him.

1451
01:53:26,634 --> 01:53:27,885
And... And I am...

1452
01:53:31,014 --> 01:53:32,015
I'm sorry.

1453
01:53:43,026 --> 01:53:44,466
Bam.

1454
01:53:45,194 --> 01:53:46,237
Bam.

1455
01:53:47,363 --> 01:53:48,364
Bam.

1456
01:53:49,532 --> 01:53:50,533
Bam.

1457
01:53:51,701 --> 01:53:52,785
Bam.

1458
01:53:53,745 --> 01:53:54,746
Bam.

1459
01:53:55,997 --> 01:53:57,040
Bam.

1460
01:53:57,123 --> 01:53:58,124
Who is this?

1461
01:53:58,583 --> 01:54:01,210
<i>Bell whore
Bell whore</i>

1462
01:54:01,294 --> 01:54:02,771
I see you've
introduced me then, Prim.

1463
01:54:02,795 --> 01:54:04,589
- I like this one though.
<i>- Bell whore</i>

1464
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,733
That's enough now,
Felicity...

1465
01:54:05,757 --> 01:54:07,258
<i>- Bell whore</i>
- Ah, f...

1466
01:54:07,342 --> 01:54:08,343
Fucker.

1467
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:10,720
Another one?

1468
01:54:11,637 --> 01:54:12,638
We missed you.

1469
01:54:13,056 --> 01:54:14,390
Monsters.

1470
01:54:16,184 --> 01:54:17,769
Oh, fucking hell.

1471
01:54:17,852 --> 01:54:19,520
<i>Bell whore</i>

1472
01:54:19,979 --> 01:54:21,564
<i>Bell whore</i>

1473
01:54:59,352 --> 01:55:00,788
<i>It is hard
to be in the position</i>

1474
01:55:00,812 --> 01:55:02,271
<i>where one wants to hit someone</i>

1475
01:55:02,355 --> 01:55:04,399
<i>who is already
in obvious pain.</i>

1476
01:55:04,482 --> 01:55:07,235
<i>It is a conundrum
for sure.</i>

1477
01:55:09,028 --> 01:55:11,072
Would you rather be
a gray slab of flesh

1478
01:55:11,155 --> 01:55:13,032
with a fishhook in your nose?

1479
01:55:13,116 --> 01:55:16,077
I will feel good for a second,
but bad for longer, so...

1480
01:55:17,537 --> 01:55:19,205
I really had a fishhook
in mY nose?

1481
01:55:19,288 --> 01:55:20,832
You did.

1482
01:55:22,542 --> 01:55:24,419
So, I am your creation...

1483
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:27,380
as is the other one.

1484
01:55:27,463 --> 01:55:29,048
Neither of you are that.

1485
01:55:29,132 --> 01:55:32,093
She wanders the halls
with a hammer and a song,

1486
01:55:32,176 --> 01:55:33,719
and that is not my doing.

1487
01:55:34,387 --> 01:55:36,639
And I read your cards
and letters home

1488
01:55:36,722 --> 01:55:39,016
and watched you
fearlessly create Bella Baxter

1489
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:40,101
with wonder.

1490
01:55:40,184 --> 01:55:42,228
I am finding
being alive fascinating,

1491
01:55:42,311 --> 01:55:44,021
so I'll forgive you the act,

1492
01:55:44,856 --> 01:55:47,066
but always hate the lies
and trapping that followed.

1493
01:55:48,067 --> 01:55:49,235
Understood.

1494
01:55:54,699 --> 01:55:55,783
Good to see you.

1495
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:57,493
You too.

1496
01:55:58,744 --> 01:56:00,788
Anger, confusion,
and brain dissonance aside,

1497
01:56:00,872 --> 01:56:01,873
I m issed You.

1498
01:56:03,249 --> 01:56:05,376
I arrived home, and I smelled
the formaldehyde,

1499
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,919
and I knew what is next.

1500
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:10,882
I will be a doctor.

1501
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,385
My surgery is yours.

1502
01:56:16,262 --> 01:56:17,513
My father once told me,

1503
01:56:18,806 --> 01:56:21,726
alwaYs carve with compassion.

1504
01:56:21,809 --> 01:56:23,936
He was a fucking idiot.

1505
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:26,522
But it's not bad advice.

1506
01:56:29,734 --> 01:56:31,360
He does not have long.

1507
01:56:32,403 --> 01:56:33,529
I know.

1508
01:56:34,906 --> 01:56:36,782
You've not mentioned
our betrothal.

1509
01:56:36,866 --> 01:56:37,867
Um...

1510
01:56:38,659 --> 01:56:40,578
You were much younger.

1511
01:56:41,746 --> 01:56:43,122
There is no bind.

1512
01:56:43,206 --> 01:56:46,209
I was mesmerized by you,
and Baxter took advantage.

1513
01:56:46,292 --> 01:56:48,127
So, you are mesmerized
no more?

1514
01:56:48,544 --> 01:56:51,339
I am still mesmerized.

1515
01:56:51,964 --> 01:56:53,382
I've been a whore,
you understand?

1516
01:56:53,758 --> 01:56:56,761
- Mm.
- Cocks for money inside me.

1517
01:56:56,844 --> 01:56:57,970
You okay with that?

1518
01:56:58,804 --> 01:57:01,140
Does the whoring thing
challenge the desire

1519
01:57:01,224 --> 01:57:03,226
for ownership that men have?

1520
01:57:03,309 --> 01:57:05,686
Wedderburn became
much weepy and swearY

1521
01:57:05,770 --> 01:57:07,355
when he discovered my whoring.

1522
01:57:08,022 --> 01:57:11,776
I find myself merely jealous
of the men's time with you

1523
01:57:11,859 --> 01:57:14,987
rather than any moral
aspersion against you.

1524
01:57:15,071 --> 01:57:16,656
It is your body, Bella Baxter.

1525
01:57:17,073 --> 01:57:18,574
Yours to give freelY.

1526
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,077
I generally charged 30 francs.

1527
01:57:21,577 --> 01:57:23,871
Well, that seems low.

1528
01:57:25,081 --> 01:57:27,792
Do you believe
people improvable, Max?

1529
01:57:27,875 --> 01:57:28,876
I do.

1530
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,879
Just as a human body
can be cured of illness,

1531
01:57:31,963 --> 01:57:35,424
so can men and women
be cured of aspect.

1532
01:57:37,635 --> 01:57:39,554
Will you marry me,
Max McCandles?

1533
01:57:41,639 --> 01:57:42,640
I will.

1534
01:57:50,064 --> 01:57:51,667
We will need less of
your tongue in the future,

1535
01:57:51,691 --> 01:57:53,317
but overall, most agreeable.

1536
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:55,486
Mm. I...
I will take that note.

1537
01:57:57,363 --> 01:58:00,616
And have You been checked
for, um, disease?

1538
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:02,493
I have not,
but I shall.

1539
01:58:03,202 --> 01:58:05,371
I'm enjoying
this practical love we have.

1540
01:58:06,747 --> 01:58:10,459
Um, but I... I assure you
mine is also passionate.

1541
01:58:11,294 --> 01:58:12,628
You are adorable.

1542
01:58:13,421 --> 01:58:14,589
You always were.

1543
01:58:24,515 --> 01:58:25,850
God, you are walking.

1544
01:58:25,933 --> 01:58:28,102
I have taken
five milligrams of heroin

1545
01:58:28,185 --> 01:58:29,520
through the toes for pain,

1546
01:58:29,604 --> 01:58:31,063
amphetamines for energy,

1547
01:58:31,147 --> 01:58:34,859
and cocaine because
I am partial to cocaine.

1548
01:58:34,942 --> 01:58:37,945
I've come here to walk you
down the aisle.

1549
01:58:50,625 --> 01:58:53,461
And so, by the powers vested
in me by the church,

1550
01:58:53,544 --> 01:58:55,379
I shall solemnize this union.

1551
01:58:56,505 --> 01:59:00,343
Do you, Bella Baxter,
take this man as your husband?

1552
01:59:00,426 --> 01:59:03,262
Did we miss the part about
anyone objecting to this?

1553
01:59:03,929 --> 01:59:05,431
Or has that been removed

1554
01:59:05,514 --> 01:59:07,850
in some kind
of faux modernization

1555
01:59:07,933 --> 01:59:08,934
of the catechism?

1556
01:59:12,188 --> 01:59:13,606
Hello, Victoria.

1557
01:59:14,357 --> 01:59:15,358
You look well.

1558
01:59:16,567 --> 01:59:18,611
Do you refer to me, sir?

1559
01:59:18,694 --> 01:59:21,364
A man doesn't normallY
introduce himself to his wife.

1560
01:59:21,447 --> 01:59:22,990
But if I must...

1561
01:59:24,408 --> 01:59:26,369
He is the God of it.

1562
01:59:26,452 --> 01:59:29,080
I do not know if he's
in her power or she in his.

1563
01:59:29,163 --> 01:59:31,374
'Tis Devil's work at hand.
Look!

1564
01:59:31,457 --> 01:59:34,418
He coughs not air
as a normal man but blood.

1565
01:59:34,502 --> 01:59:36,253
He has cancer,
you fucking idiot.

1566
01:59:37,046 --> 01:59:38,047
Oh.

1567
01:59:38,130 --> 01:59:39,131
Duncan.

1568
01:59:39,215 --> 01:59:41,300
Do not lay
your eyes on me, demon!

1569
01:59:43,511 --> 01:59:46,889
As I was saying,
General Alfred Blessington.

1570
01:59:47,723 --> 01:59:49,308
"Alfie" to you.

1571
01:59:49,392 --> 01:59:50,976
You really do not know me?

1572
01:59:52,269 --> 01:59:54,522
When Mr. Wedderburn
put your photo in the paper...

1573
01:59:54,605 --> 01:59:56,899
I remembered
that old bird in the hotel

1574
01:59:56,982 --> 01:59:59,110
called you
Victoria Blessington,

1575
01:59:59,193 --> 02:00:03,447
and I pieced this diabolical
fuckfest of a puzzle together.

1576
02:00:05,449 --> 02:00:07,243
- You are...
- Your dear Alfie.

1577
02:00:07,952 --> 02:00:11,497
You left in a state of some
mental addlement and hysteria

1578
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:12,581
over your pregnancy.

1579
02:00:13,833 --> 02:00:15,060
On the discovery
of your absence,

1580
02:00:15,084 --> 02:00:16,711
I felt disemboweled.

1581
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:20,005
I have disemboweled men
on the field of battle,

1582
02:00:20,089 --> 02:00:24,385
and I always imagined a dull,
hollow throbbing,

1583
02:00:24,927 --> 02:00:26,971
and that is what it was like.

1584
02:00:27,596 --> 02:00:28,806
There's also a stench,

1585
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:32,476
but that does not apply
as a metaphor here.

1586
02:00:33,894 --> 02:00:35,688
But here you are, my darling.

1587
02:00:36,605 --> 02:00:37,606
Here You are.

1588
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:39,191
God.

1589
02:00:39,275 --> 02:00:41,068
I have no recollection of you.

1590
02:00:41,944 --> 02:00:43,487
I am Bella Baxter.

1591
02:00:43,946 --> 02:00:45,030
Hurtful.

1592
02:00:45,448 --> 02:00:46,991
But perhaps
you've hit your head,

1593
02:00:47,074 --> 02:00:49,368
and these men have clearly
taken advantage of you.

1594
02:00:49,452 --> 02:00:51,203
Please go, sir.

1595
02:00:52,955 --> 02:00:55,416
- You were my husband?
- Your dear Alfie.

1596
02:00:55,499 --> 02:00:57,626
Bella, I'm sorry.

1597
02:01:03,799 --> 02:01:05,426
Actually, I would like to go.

1598
02:01:06,051 --> 02:01:07,887
- What?
- Bella?

1599
02:01:11,766 --> 02:01:13,267
You have a carriage, sir?

1600
02:01:14,435 --> 02:01:15,478
Yes.

1601
02:01:15,561 --> 02:01:16,645
Let us go then.

1602
02:01:16,729 --> 02:01:17,772
Bella!

1603
02:01:17,855 --> 02:01:19,064
Let me go, God.

1604
02:01:19,857 --> 02:01:21,317
Max, You will not stop me.

1605
02:01:30,576 --> 02:01:32,578
It is good to have you back,
Victoria.

1606
02:01:49,094 --> 02:01:50,822
The servants and I
have not been getting along.

1607
02:01:50,846 --> 02:01:52,389
I fear an uprising.

1608
02:02:02,483 --> 02:02:03,984
You remember David, darling?

1609
02:02:06,195 --> 02:02:08,405
Allison, look who's back.

1610
02:02:15,079 --> 02:02:16,288
You know me?

1611
02:02:18,123 --> 02:02:19,500
Tell me about myself.

1612
02:02:21,961 --> 02:02:23,087
Was I nice?

1613
02:03:00,416 --> 02:03:01,417
Eat.

1614
02:03:02,835 --> 02:03:04,003
All Your favorites.

1615
02:03:04,086 --> 02:03:06,130
Kippers, goose,

1616
02:03:06,922 --> 02:03:09,425
tongue, champagne.

1617
02:03:10,259 --> 02:03:11,260
I've missed you.

1618
02:03:13,345 --> 02:03:15,347
What was the root
of the unhappiness?

1619
02:03:17,141 --> 02:03:19,310
What drove her
to leap off the bridge?

1620
02:03:22,229 --> 02:03:23,898
You hated the baby.

1621
02:03:23,981 --> 02:03:25,608
You called it "the monster."

1622
02:03:26,859 --> 02:03:27,943
I see.

1623
02:03:29,612 --> 02:03:31,864
I have noticed
a lack of maternal instinct.

1624
02:03:33,574 --> 02:03:35,409
And Yet I'm happY
to have you home.

1625
02:03:38,078 --> 02:03:39,163
How did we meet?

1626
02:03:39,872 --> 02:03:41,373
At a ball.

1627
02:03:41,457 --> 02:03:42,958
Why did we like
each other?

1628
02:03:44,543 --> 02:03:46,378
We shared a love
of good times.

1629
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:49,131
Watch.

1630
02:03:50,591 --> 02:03:52,551
Allison, soup!

1631
02:04:02,478 --> 02:04:03,562
Rex!

1632
02:04:09,026 --> 02:04:11,070
- Fuck!
- Allison,

1633
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:13,447
we'll have some cheese
when you can.

1634
02:04:19,995 --> 02:04:21,956
- A love of cruelty?
- Mm.

1635
02:04:23,707 --> 02:04:26,126
I was not a kind person,
it seems.

1636
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:29,380
Kind? You would never
be so dull, Victoria.

1637
02:04:29,463 --> 02:04:30,714
Appalling idea.

1638
02:04:31,924 --> 02:04:33,425
Wedderburn says
you were a whore.

1639
02:04:33,509 --> 02:04:35,386
- I suspect that was part...
- I was.

1640
02:04:35,469 --> 02:04:36,762
In Paris.

1641
02:04:36,845 --> 02:04:39,223
I tired of it,
but it was fascinating.

1642
02:04:40,599 --> 02:04:41,600
Right.

1643
02:04:41,684 --> 02:04:43,185
These kippers
are strangely delicious.

1644
02:04:43,978 --> 02:04:45,771
Vinegary or something.

1645
02:04:52,778 --> 02:04:54,863
Marriage
is a constant challenge.

1646
02:04:55,489 --> 02:04:57,992
Some, we bend to,
some we bend to us.

1647
02:04:59,868 --> 02:05:02,746
I will try to
forgive you for the whoring.

1648
02:05:03,497 --> 02:05:06,583
Your sexual hysteria
was often out of hand.

1649
02:05:07,334 --> 02:05:09,211
And for the killing
of our unborn child.

1650
02:05:10,295 --> 02:05:12,715
In fact, when I list the ways
you've wronged me,

1651
02:05:12,798 --> 02:05:14,341
Jesus Christ himself

1652
02:05:14,425 --> 02:05:16,885
would probably
beat your head in with a bat.

1653
02:05:20,472 --> 02:05:22,516
You're blessed
with a forgiving husband.

1654
02:05:24,351 --> 02:05:26,186
I've not wronged you, Alfie,

1655
02:05:26,770 --> 02:05:28,230
as I do not know you.

1656
02:05:28,313 --> 02:05:30,083
Well, you're in luck as
I've had a lot of experience

1657
02:05:30,107 --> 02:05:32,317
in the field with amnesia.

1658
02:05:32,401 --> 02:05:35,195
Either men who wish to forget
where they were,

1659
02:05:35,279 --> 02:05:37,281
or a mortar exploded nearby,

1660
02:05:37,364 --> 02:05:39,408
ringing their cranium
like a church bell.

1661
02:05:40,409 --> 02:05:43,287
I suggest we stick close to
the house for several months,

1662
02:05:43,370 --> 02:05:44,580
maybe a year.

1663
02:05:47,416 --> 02:05:49,084
Until you've made
a full recovery.

1664
02:05:51,712 --> 02:05:52,772
I will leave at mY leisure,

1665
02:05:52,796 --> 02:05:55,215
but I am flattered
by your desire to trap me.

1666
02:05:57,468 --> 02:05:58,635
You're not the first.

1667
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:02,931
I will have to shoot you
in the fucking head

1668
02:06:03,557 --> 02:06:05,392
if you try to leave, darling.

1669
02:06:05,476 --> 02:06:07,186
The front or the back
of the head?

1670
02:06:07,561 --> 02:06:08,812
The back.

1671
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:10,355
As to be sure you were leaving

1672
02:06:10,439 --> 02:06:12,191
and I was not being rash.

1673
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:19,281
I have missed You.

1674
02:06:23,243 --> 02:06:24,995
So, I'm a prisoner?

1675
02:06:25,079 --> 02:06:27,247
This conversation
has gone down

1676
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:28,749
an unfortunate route.

1677
02:06:29,792 --> 02:06:32,503
I am sure you will be as happY
as you were before.

1678
02:06:33,879 --> 02:06:36,381
As I was before when
I threw myself from a bridge?

1679
02:06:42,763 --> 02:06:45,432
I suspect you fell
while looking for fish.

1680
02:06:47,184 --> 02:06:48,411
Why would you want
to keep me here

1681
02:06:48,435 --> 02:06:49,812
if I do not wish to stay?

1682
02:06:50,479 --> 02:06:52,397
If one must drown,

1683
02:06:52,481 --> 02:06:54,775
let it be
in the river of love.

1684
02:07:01,115 --> 02:07:02,533
Mm.

1685
02:07:04,493 --> 02:07:05,494
David,

1686
02:07:06,912 --> 02:07:09,039
does that pheasant
look stripped to the bone?

1687
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:11,375
It was a misjudgment, sir.

1688
02:07:11,834 --> 02:07:12,835
I apologize.

1689
02:07:21,885 --> 02:07:23,762
Dessert, darling?

1690
02:08:22,112 --> 02:08:23,697
It comes off easy?

1691
02:08:23,780 --> 02:08:25,282
Like a button on a suit.

1692
02:08:26,658 --> 02:08:28,911
I saw them do it in Africa
with sharpened rocks,

1693
02:08:28,994 --> 02:08:32,789
but had mY own
more precise device made.

1694
02:08:34,583 --> 02:08:35,918
Do you want just clitoral hood

1695
02:08:36,001 --> 02:08:37,711
or glans as well?

1696
02:08:37,794 --> 02:08:39,671
The whole
infernal packet.

1697
02:08:39,755 --> 02:08:41,757
It will calm her no end.

1698
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,467
This time we will get it done.

1699
02:08:44,134 --> 02:08:45,135
I shall get her sedated

1700
02:08:45,219 --> 02:08:46,899
and bring her
to Your surgery this evening.

1701
02:08:57,314 --> 02:08:59,608
Victoria, darling!

1702
02:09:01,026 --> 02:09:02,194
Where are you?

1703
02:09:06,531 --> 02:09:07,532
Oh.

1704
02:09:07,616 --> 02:09:08,992
Perfect timing.

1705
02:09:09,076 --> 02:09:10,118
Martini.

1706
02:09:10,202 --> 02:09:11,411
Rather not.

1707
02:09:11,995 --> 02:09:13,872
I would, however,
like to leave.

1708
02:09:14,373 --> 02:09:16,375
I have found
our time together interesting,

1709
02:09:16,458 --> 02:09:19,127
but I've ascertained
why I jumped from a bridge.

1710
02:09:19,962 --> 02:09:22,506
I wish to go see
my near dead God.

1711
02:09:23,131 --> 02:09:24,174
Adorable idea.

1712
02:09:24,258 --> 02:09:25,842
Unfortunately, mY darling,

1713
02:09:25,926 --> 02:09:28,887
my life is dedicated
to the taking of territory.

1714
02:09:28,971 --> 02:09:29,972
You are mine,

1715
02:09:30,055 --> 02:09:32,266
and that is the long
and short of it.

1716
02:09:33,016 --> 02:09:34,434
I am not territory.

1717
02:09:34,518 --> 02:09:38,272
The root of the problem
is between your legs.

1718
02:09:38,355 --> 02:09:39,523
I will have it off

1719
02:09:39,606 --> 02:09:42,526
and it will not distract
and divert you anymore.

1720
02:09:42,609 --> 02:09:43,819
You see, a man spends his life

1721
02:09:43,902 --> 02:09:45,779
wrangling
his sexual compulsions.

1722
02:09:45,862 --> 02:09:49,074
It's a curse and yet,
in some ways, his life's work.

1723
02:09:49,157 --> 02:09:51,201
A woman's life's work
is children.

1724
02:09:51,285 --> 02:09:52,286
I intend to rid you

1725
02:09:52,369 --> 02:09:54,454
of that infernal packet
between your legs

1726
02:09:54,538 --> 02:09:56,748
and plant a seed in you
straight after.

1727
02:09:57,207 --> 02:09:59,293
Let me explain
what has happened.

1728
02:09:59,376 --> 02:10:01,003
Victoria, your wife,

1729
02:10:01,086 --> 02:10:03,297
threw herself
from a bridge and died.

1730
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:06,508
Godwin Baxter found her,
brought her to his surgery.

1731
02:10:06,591 --> 02:10:08,051
He then removed the baby,

1732
02:10:08,135 --> 02:10:09,803
removed the brain
from the baby,

1733
02:10:09,886 --> 02:10:12,806
transplanted it into mY head
and reanimated me.

1734
02:10:12,889 --> 02:10:13,950
- Ah.
- I'll bring you the file.

1735
02:10:13,974 --> 02:10:15,809
It's actually
quite fascinating.

1736
02:10:15,892 --> 02:10:17,769
However,
I will keep my new life

1737
02:10:17,853 --> 02:10:20,314
and my lovely old clitoris,
thank You.

1738
02:10:20,397 --> 02:10:21,982
If You'd call
a carriage for me.

1739
02:10:22,858 --> 02:10:24,609
They talk and talk,
and yet at some point,

1740
02:10:24,693 --> 02:10:26,361
there's nothing left
but to pull a gun.

1741
02:10:27,738 --> 02:10:29,614
'Tis the way with women.

1742
02:10:42,419 --> 02:10:43,420
Are you giving in?

1743
02:10:44,629 --> 02:10:47,674
I'd rather you shot me
in the fucking heart.

1744
02:10:47,758 --> 02:10:50,052
I will oblige if I have to.

1745
02:10:51,678 --> 02:10:53,263
Drink the drink, darling.

1746
02:10:54,056 --> 02:10:55,057
Chloroform and gin.

1747
02:11:04,941 --> 02:11:06,526
In some ways,
it would be a relief

1748
02:11:06,610 --> 02:11:08,695
to be rid of my questing self.

1749
02:11:09,237 --> 02:11:11,656
Sip deeply
and that freedom is yours.

1750
02:11:24,461 --> 02:11:25,462
Fuck.

1751
02:11:40,227 --> 02:11:41,228
Max?

1752
02:11:44,439 --> 02:11:47,526
Max. We have
to get him to surgery.

1753
02:11:48,402 --> 02:11:49,653
He'll die if we don't.

1754
02:11:49,736 --> 02:11:50,904
Bleeding a lot.

1755
02:11:50,987 --> 02:11:53,115
You're fucking dead.

1756
02:11:54,241 --> 02:11:55,909
Uh, Bella, if he lives,

1757
02:11:55,992 --> 02:11:59,413
I do not sense
he is a man who will stop.

1758
02:11:59,955 --> 02:12:01,665
Well, I won't watch him
bleed to death.

1759
02:12:02,207 --> 02:12:04,209
But I agree,
he could do with improvement.

1760
02:12:17,305 --> 02:12:19,266
I've removed the bullet
and stopped the bleeding.

1761
02:12:19,891 --> 02:12:21,226
I have the notes.

1762
02:12:29,317 --> 02:12:31,736
I am never happier
than when I'm in here.

1763
02:13:04,561 --> 02:13:05,979
Bella.

1764
02:13:06,062 --> 02:13:07,355
You're back.

1765
02:13:13,278 --> 02:13:15,739
It was just a story
of someone else,

1766
02:13:16,948 --> 02:13:18,450
not Bella Baxter.

1767
02:13:26,416 --> 02:13:29,377
All my life,
people's eyes looked at me,

1768
02:13:29,461 --> 02:13:31,505
horror, pity...

1769
02:13:33,215 --> 02:13:34,382
but you.

1770
02:13:41,932 --> 02:13:44,017
It's all very interesting...

1771
02:13:46,061 --> 02:13:47,687
what is happening.

1772
02:14:44,411 --> 02:14:45,537
<i>Merci.</i>

1773
02:14:47,622 --> 02:14:49,541
Anatomy exam
is making me nervous.

1774
02:14:49,624 --> 02:14:52,127
I've tested You many times.
You know it.

1775
02:14:53,545 --> 02:14:55,547
No one knows anatomy
better than you.

1776
02:15:00,176 --> 02:15:01,261
Ladies, gin?

1777
02:15:02,137 --> 02:15:03,138
Please.

1778
02:15:03,722 --> 02:15:04,723
Gin?

1779
02:15:07,392 --> 02:15:09,769
We should get some water
for the general.

1780
02:15:16,026 --> 02:15:17,027
Felicity,

1781
02:15:18,028 --> 02:15:19,029
water.
