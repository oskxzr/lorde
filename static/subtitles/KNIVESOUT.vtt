01:43.357 --> 01:45.659
Morning, Mr. Thrombey.

01:59.028 --> 02:01.605
Mr. Thrombey, you up there?

02:01.992 --> 02:04.282
Mr. Thrombey, I'm coming in.

02:14.994 --> 02:16.356
Shit!

02:37.088 --> 02:40.428
<i>You killed him! You bastard!
You murdered him!</i>

02:40.428 --> 02:41.902
<i>I didn't murder nobody.</i>

02:41.902 --> 02:45.745
<i>You slashed his face open and you left him
bleeding in the street, like a stuffed pig.</i>

02:45.745 --> 02:50.423
<i>Then you crushed his skull with a forklift and
burnt his hands off to erase the fingerprints.</i>

02:50.423 --> 02:51.547
<i>You'll never prove it.</i>

02:51.547 --> 02:53.730
<i>We have the nanny cam footage!</i>

02:53.730 --> 02:55.843
Alice, turn that off now, please.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.911
Why? It's almost over.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.050
Now, please. Just turn that off.

02:58.050 --> 03:00.042
They're finding out who did it,
and the WiFi sucks in my room...

03:00.042 --> 03:02.943
Turn it off now! Alice! Off!

03:02.943 --> 03:05.249
There isn't even anything bad on it,
it's just normal TV...

03:05.249 --> 03:07.564
They're talking murder on it!

03:07.564 --> 03:11.143
Your sister just had a friend
she loves slit his throat open,

03:11.143 --> 03:13.155
and she doesn't need
to be hearing that right now!

03:13.155 --> 03:15.119
Let's be sensitive!

03:19.229 --> 03:21.262
Alice, you can keep watching
your show, it's fine.

03:21.262 --> 03:23.206
No, I guessed who did it anyway.

03:23.206 --> 03:25.901
- I'm sorry Marta.
- It's okay.

03:27.647 --> 03:29.411
It's Harlan's son.

03:32.530 --> 03:33.622
Hi, Walt.

03:33.622 --> 03:35.480
Hi, Martha. It's Walt.

03:35.654 --> 03:37.460
Would you mind
coming to the house early?

03:37.460 --> 03:40.749
The police have
a few more questions for everybody.

03:40.962 --> 03:42.656
What?

04:01.934 --> 04:05.174
Hey! Excuse me ma'am.
You with the help?

04:05.174 --> 04:07.865
Hey! Her name is Marta.
She was granddad's nurse.

04:07.865 --> 04:10.261
She's with us. "The help?"

04:10.834 --> 04:12.681
It's okay. I'm sorry.

04:12.745 --> 04:15.359
No. It's not okay.
What the hell?

04:24.893 --> 04:26.420
How are you doing?

04:28.030 --> 04:30.786
Not very good. Alone.

04:31.482 --> 04:35.687
Lots of days,
and not knowing what to do next.

04:36.036 --> 04:39.012
Martha, anything you need.

04:39.774 --> 04:41.807
You're part of this family.

04:43.304 --> 04:44.312
Thank you.

04:46.156 --> 04:48.502
- How are you doing kiddo?
- Linda.

04:49.272 --> 04:50.778
How are you?

04:52.584 --> 04:56.127
You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.

04:56.427 --> 04:59.222
I thought you should've been there.
I was out voted.

04:59.222 --> 05:01.321
Get arrested.
Die up your own ass for all I care!

05:01.321 --> 05:02.965
Richard.

05:03.285 --> 05:04.797
He's not coming.

05:05.567 --> 05:08.811
Ransom. Little shit.
Missed the funeral.

05:09.191 --> 05:10.589
Excuse me.

05:11.024 --> 05:13.740
We're ready for you now.
We'd like to see you one at a time.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.975
All right. I'll go first.

05:15.975 --> 05:20.163
I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up
before the memorial tonight.

05:20.443 --> 05:22.173
We'll do our best, ma'am.

05:24.509 --> 05:27.411
So, how are you doing kiddo?

05:28.743 --> 05:31.315
We're just gonna reintroduce
ourselves as a formality.

05:31.315 --> 05:34.810
I am Detective Lieutenant Elliott,
and this is Trooper Wagner.

05:34.961 --> 05:40.044
Now, I'm going to record,
this just to make things easier.

05:40.327 --> 05:42.578
All right, we're with Linda Drysdale,
nee Thrombey,

05:43.084 --> 05:44.954
Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter,

05:45.923 --> 05:48.313
in discussing the events
that took place the night of his demise,

05:48.313 --> 05:50.702
one week ago, November 8th.

05:50.702 --> 05:52.928
We're very sorry for your loss.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.673
Thank you. That means a lot.

05:56.879 --> 06:00.000
So, we understand at that night
the family had gathered

06:00.000 --> 06:02.130
to celebrate
your father's 85th birthday.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.382
Yes.

06:03.382 --> 06:04.594
How was it?

06:04.985 --> 06:07.488
The party? Pre my dad's death?

06:08.304 --> 06:09.819
It was great.

06:10.276 --> 06:12.761
Did anyone besides the family
show face?

06:13.396 --> 06:15.135
Fran, the housekeeper.

06:15.135 --> 06:18.467
He was a nice guy,
but he was so hairy.

06:18.467 --> 06:21.298
And I dated Italian guys,
you know what I mean.

06:22.217 --> 06:26.506
Marta, Harlan's caregiver,
good girl, hard worker.

06:26.796 --> 06:28.686
Family's from Ecuador.

06:29.146 --> 06:33.040
And Wanetta - Greatnana,
Harlan's mom.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.075
Hi Nana.

06:34.075 --> 06:37.344
His mom? How old is she?

06:37.968 --> 06:39.419
We have no idea.

06:39.723 --> 06:43.188
Okay, and your son Ransom,
did he attend as well?

06:43.312 --> 06:45.074
Yes, but he left early.

06:45.748 --> 06:48.941
Ransom, are you leaving?

06:54.520 --> 06:58.838
Right, would you say that all three of you
showed up around the same time?

06:59.911 --> 07:01.277
No.

07:02.931 --> 07:06.373
Richard came early
to help the caterers set up.

07:06.573 --> 07:10.494
Okay, and you and your husband Richard
work at a real estate firm in Boston?

07:10.494 --> 07:12.388
No, it's my company.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.942
Right, right. Sorry.

07:13.942 --> 07:15.924
I built my business
from the ground up.

07:16.234 --> 07:19.158
Just like your father.
You two were very close?

07:20.656 --> 07:23.869
We had our own secret way
of communicating.

07:23.994 --> 07:26.847
You had to find that with dad.

07:27.018 --> 07:28.893
You had to find a game
to play with him.

07:29.041 --> 07:32.903
And if you did that,
and you played by his rules...

07:38.322 --> 07:41.052
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?

07:41.174 --> 07:42.945
I don't know, do they?

07:43.989 --> 07:47.298
Very much not,
don't know why I said that.

07:48.071 --> 07:50.004
But my wife, Linda, does.

07:50.004 --> 07:52.412
Harlan started out
with a rusty Smith-Corona,

07:52.412 --> 07:56.814
and built himself into one of the
bestselling mystery writers of all time.

07:56.814 --> 08:01.203
Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.

08:03.012 --> 08:04.487
Sure.

08:04.636 --> 08:09.183
For the record, I'm speaking with Walt
Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's youngest son.

08:09.183 --> 08:11.681
So, you run
your father's publishing company?

08:11.681 --> 08:12.531
Yeah.

08:12.531 --> 08:14.368
It's my - it's our...

08:14.530 --> 08:17.764
It's the family's publishing company,
dad trusts me to run it.

08:18.761 --> 08:24.019
30 languages, over 80 million
copies sold. A real legacy.

08:24.854 --> 08:25.945
You guys fans?

08:25.945 --> 08:28.316
I mean, I don't do
much fiction reading myself.

08:28.316 --> 08:30.822
Big fan. I'm big fan.
I mean...

08:30.822 --> 08:33.401
His plots are just like...
I got one spoiler for you,

08:33.401 --> 08:36.873
But, okay, like "A Thousand Knives",
the cow and the shotgun,

08:36.873 --> 08:39.296
like, where do you
come up with that?

08:39.516 --> 08:42.785
Dad said the plots just popped into
his head fully formed.

08:42.785 --> 08:44.676
It was the easy part for him.

08:47.063 --> 08:48.689
So, you're in the area, right?

08:48.689 --> 08:51.234
You guys probably arrived
around the same time?

08:53.063 --> 08:54.923
We all got here around 8.

08:55.391 --> 08:57.569
My wife Donna, she's my rock.

08:59.501 --> 09:01.651
Jesus! Donna. Are you all right?

09:02.111 --> 09:07.650
My son Jacob, he's 16.
Very politically active.

09:07.650 --> 09:09.350
The boy is literally a Nazi.

09:09.350 --> 09:11.439
He's an alt-right troll dipshit.

09:11.756 --> 09:14.276
Kids today, with the internet.
It's amazing.

09:15.379 --> 09:16.849
So, the night went well?

09:18.901 --> 09:22.968
I mean, we're all gutted, but I was happy
to have that night with him.

09:22.968 --> 09:27.664
To be by his side, to think about our books
and what we've accomplished with them.

09:28.156 --> 09:31.125
It's like I can still feel
his hand on my shoulder.

09:32.517 --> 09:34.147
Passing the torch.

09:34.147 --> 09:38.782
So, we're here with Joni Thrombey,
Harlan Thrombey's daughter in law?

09:39.420 --> 09:43.331
Yeah, I married his son Neil.
We had one daughter, Meg.

09:43.609 --> 09:47.222
And then Neil passed on,
15 years ago.

09:47.482 --> 09:49.571
And you remained close
to the Thrombeys.

09:49.571 --> 09:51.697
Oh, they're my family.

09:55.121 --> 09:57.581
I feel simultaneously freed by

09:58.996 --> 10:01.440
and supported by them.

10:05.048 --> 10:08.200
It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.417
Sorry, the Nugget of...?

10:10.417 --> 10:11.723
Flam.

10:12.580 --> 10:14.874
Yeah, Flam, your skin care
company. Sorry.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.610
I forgive you.

10:17.087 --> 10:20.171
Yeah, it's skin care,
but it promotes a total lifestyle.

10:20.171 --> 10:24.079
Self sufficiency with an acknowledgment
of human need.

10:24.079 --> 10:27.103
That's Flam, but it's also Harlan.

10:27.241 --> 10:29.627
He got me and Meg
through some tough times.

10:29.887 --> 10:31.554
Granddad gives my mom
a yearly allowance,

10:31.554 --> 10:35.154
and he's never missed
wiring a tuition payment to my schools.

10:36.773 --> 10:39.439
He's a genuinely selfless man.

10:40.013 --> 10:41.991
But, you left his party early?

10:41.991 --> 10:42.929
Have fun.

10:42.929 --> 10:44.357
To see some friends at Smith.

10:44.357 --> 10:48.073
You know, Dad pays
for her crypto-Marxist

10:48.073 --> 10:52.669
postdeconstructual feminist
poetry theory whatever major.

10:53.359 --> 10:55.449
She could've stuck around
for the cake.

10:55.545 --> 10:57.595
I think Linda was upset.

11:01.009 --> 11:02.867
But Harlan understood.

11:06.968 --> 11:08.130
Right.

11:08.648 --> 11:11.683
You two showed up to the party
around the same time?

11:11.683 --> 11:14.973
If I could pause.
Because I just...

11:15.900 --> 11:18.902
Who is that guy?
And why are we doing all this? Again?

11:18.902 --> 11:20.585
This is just follow up questions,

11:20.785 --> 11:23.898
We're tending to be thorough,
so we can figure out the manner of death.

11:24.238 --> 11:26.845
So by "manner of death"
you mean if someone killed him?

11:26.845 --> 11:29.873
If one of us killed him.
One of his family.

11:29.873 --> 11:31.124
- No, Walt.
- killed him.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.871
Is that what
you're suggesting, Lieutenant?

11:32.871 --> 11:35.577
No one is saying that, okay?
This is all pro forma.

11:35.992 --> 11:37.120
Okay.

11:37.942 --> 11:39.653
So, who the fuck is that?

11:41.610 --> 11:43.319
This is Benoit Blanc.

11:43.887 --> 11:45.622
Benoit Blanc?

11:45.622 --> 11:49.784
Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private investigator
of great renown.

11:49.784 --> 11:50.913
Wait a minute.

11:51.089 --> 11:54.370
I read a tweet
about a New Yorker article about you.

11:54.370 --> 11:56.492
The last of the gentlemen sleuths?

11:56.492 --> 11:59.201
You solved that case
with the tennis champ.

12:00.061 --> 12:01.910
You're famous!

12:02.405 --> 12:05.896
Mr. Blanc is not with the police department,
and not officially involved in the case,

12:05.896 --> 12:07.500
but he's offered to consult.

12:07.962 --> 12:10.020
I happily obliged
and I can vouch for him.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.100
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are.

12:12.100 --> 12:15.540
I read your profile in the New Yorker.
I found it delightful.

12:16.239 --> 12:20.885
I just buried my 85 year old father,
who committed suicide.

12:21.205 --> 12:22.949
Why are you here?

12:24.646 --> 12:27.563
I'm here at the behest of a client.

12:28.238 --> 12:29.413
Who?

12:30.480 --> 12:34.067
I cannot say,
but let me assure you this:

12:34.569 --> 12:37.675
my presence will be ornamental.

12:38.028 --> 12:43.591
You will find me a respectful,
quiet, passive observer

12:44.722 --> 12:46.244
of the truth.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.073
Fine. Are we getting there?

12:50.426 --> 12:52.790
Nearly. Harlan's nurse.

12:52.790 --> 12:55.737
She was at the party
in a professional capacity?

12:55.737 --> 12:57.131
Marta?

12:57.862 --> 12:58.989
I guess.

12:59.298 --> 13:02.988
Harlan hired her to be around to take care
of whatever medical needs popped up.

13:03.655 --> 13:06.631
But really she's
like part of the family.

13:06.909 --> 13:09.727
Good kid.
Been a good friend to Harlan.

13:10.088 --> 13:14.203
Family's from Paraguay.
Linda really likes her work ethic.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.421
"Immigrants - we get the job done."

13:21.899 --> 13:24.036
- From Hamilton.
- Oh Hamilton!

13:24.403 --> 13:25.453
It's so good.

13:25.453 --> 13:27.123
I saw it at the public.

13:29.324 --> 13:30.617
May I just...

13:31.505 --> 13:32.941
Then, I'll recede, but...

13:33.787 --> 13:36.074
As a self-made man myself,

13:36.858 --> 13:42.102
I have to express my admiration for how
you've followed in your father's footsteps.

13:43.413 --> 13:44.185
Thank you.

13:44.185 --> 13:47.842
Just marvelous, you know.
The whole family too.

13:47.985 --> 13:52.335
Joni with her thing,
Walt with his publishing empire.

13:54.539 --> 13:55.787
Well.

13:56.946 --> 14:02.181
Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well
with what dad gave him.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.679
Not that it matters, but
really, Dad hands him a book

14:05.679 --> 14:08.456
twice a year, and Walt publishes it.

14:09.914 --> 14:10.836
It's just not the same.

14:10.836 --> 14:16.796
But, surely, Walt runs the merchandising,
adaptations, film and television rights...

14:17.296 --> 14:19.427
Are you baiting me, Detective?

14:20.414 --> 14:21.993
You know he doesn't.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.543
And you think I am dumb enough

14:24.543 --> 14:27.861
to be baited into talking
family business,

14:27.861 --> 14:33.190
into shit talking my baby brother in front
of a police detective and a state trooper...

14:33.353 --> 14:35.415
Walt doesn't run shit!

14:35.650 --> 14:38.093
Because there are no
TV and film rights.

14:38.484 --> 14:41.362
Harlan's never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

14:41.521 --> 14:43.552
- Hated the idea.
- No!

14:43.908 --> 14:46.450
Yeah! Drives Walt nuts.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.658
'Cause that's where the real money is.

14:49.107 --> 14:53.013
Walt would get a little Irish courage
in him, he'd get into it with Harlan.

14:53.302 --> 14:55.856
Did he get "into it" at the party?

14:56.206 --> 14:57.532
Oh my God!

14:57.532 --> 14:58.516
Come one, Dad!

14:58.516 --> 15:02.516
He wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy.
Harlan finally had to give him the hook.

15:03.652 --> 15:07.430
I didn't hear what he said,
but he must've really handed him his lunch.

15:07.608 --> 15:11.100
'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy
the rest of the night.

15:11.306 --> 15:14.812
What? Richard said what?
No, Jesus, we did not get "into it."

15:14.812 --> 15:17.689
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

15:18.555 --> 15:23.232
Harlan took you aside at the party,
when you returned you were chastened.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.143
What did Harlan say to you?

15:30.089 --> 15:33.097
The Netflix guys, their business
affairs guy, he sent something over,

15:33.097 --> 15:35.955
it's hard numbers this time,
and I just think this is a window,

15:36.280 --> 15:38.763
that's not gonna stay open,
we need to take advantage of it,

15:38.763 --> 15:40.733
but then you just need
to look at the numbers.

15:41.227 --> 15:42.584
- Walt.
- Dad!

15:43.372 --> 15:48.388
You put me in charge of our books, let
me be in charge, let me do this! Please.

15:48.423 --> 15:52.266
They're not our books, son.
They're my books.

15:53.207 --> 15:56.233
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.524
But you're right,
you're right, it's...

15:58.822 --> 16:02.358
It's unfair of me to keep you tethered

16:02.714 --> 16:05.387
to something that isn't yours to control.

16:05.387 --> 16:06.728
What?

16:07.204 --> 16:10.337
I've done you a grave disservice.

16:11.319 --> 16:14.513
All these years I have kept you from

16:14.513 --> 16:18.302
building something of your own,
that was yours.

16:20.148 --> 16:25.214
But you're not going to be running
the publishing house anymore.

16:25.894 --> 16:27.328
You're free of it.

16:30.651 --> 16:32.456
Dad, are you firing me?

16:34.659 --> 16:36.565
We'll talk about details tomorrow.

16:37.265 --> 16:41.238
My mind's made up. Good boy.

16:49.387 --> 16:53.078
We talked, we had a business discussion
about e-books.

16:54.157 --> 16:56.281
Jesus, it was nothing.

16:57.304 --> 17:00.406
You wanna talk about an argument,
hell, Ransom had an argument with him.

17:00.406 --> 17:03.392
Ransom, that's Richard and Linda's son?

17:04.607 --> 17:07.326
Look, we all love Ransom,
he's a good kid, we love him.

17:09.886 --> 17:11.162
But?

17:11.162 --> 17:13.463
But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.908
I'm not trying to... I like to keep
stuff like this in the family,

17:17.908 --> 17:20.974
but with Ransom,
he's never had a job.

17:21.148 --> 17:25.243
And dad for some unknown reason
always supported him.

17:25.381 --> 17:28.815
They have this love hate bond.
They fight.

17:29.790 --> 17:32.250
But that night, God,
they had a blow out.

17:32.813 --> 17:33.898
About what?

17:33.898 --> 17:35.898
Are you, goddamn, insane?

17:35.911 --> 17:38.502
We couldn't make it out really,
but it was huge.

17:39.081 --> 17:42.152
And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.

17:42.294 --> 17:46.212
Usually, they like to stoke up drama
in front of the whole family.

17:46.619 --> 17:48.448
Speaking of getting into it.

17:49.451 --> 17:52.943
You were at the house early
to help the caterer set up.

17:53.878 --> 17:57.036
Did you converse
with Harlan at that time?

17:58.064 --> 17:59.949
Well, he was there,
we must have spoke.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.624
In his study?

18:03.460 --> 18:04.929
I don't think so.

18:05.409 --> 18:08.117
You see, I spoke with the caterer
this morning.

18:08.209 --> 18:11.031
She didn't see you
helping her staff,

18:11.031 --> 18:16.479
She did hear Harlan in a screaming match
with someone that afternoon in his study.

18:17.291 --> 18:19.882
I don't... A screaming match?

18:21.152 --> 18:22.176
No.

18:23.616 --> 18:26.619
But Joni was here too, she was early.

18:26.619 --> 18:28.982
So, it might have been her,
maybe ask her.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.829
These were two male voices.

18:31.105 --> 18:32.975
Harlan shouted the phrase.

18:32.975 --> 18:35.315
You tell her or I will!

18:35.832 --> 18:39.805
"You tell her or I will."

18:41.545 --> 18:43.093
Bells ringing?

18:51.768 --> 18:54.379
That's none of your business.
You stay out of my marriage!

18:54.379 --> 18:57.615
I know my daughter.
And she would want to know.

18:57.615 --> 19:01.725
I've put it all of it in this
letter to her. Tomorrow she gets it.

19:01.725 --> 19:05.447
Harlan, I'm warning you.
You stay out of my marriage!

19:05.447 --> 19:07.393
She deserves to know
and you gonna tell her.

19:07.393 --> 19:10.440
- The hell I am.
- You tell her or I will!

19:13.119 --> 19:15.240
Yes. I know.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.185
Yes.

19:20.676 --> 19:25.668
Harlan finally decided to put his mom
in a nursing home.

19:25.847 --> 19:27.642
Linda'd always opposed that.

19:27.724 --> 19:31.497
And I wanted to wait until we got
back from Boston to tell Linda.

19:32.230 --> 19:33.923
To avoid the whole scene.

19:33.923 --> 19:37.093
And Harlan wanted me
to tell her then.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.222
That was it.

19:39.954 --> 19:41.915
Sorry. Forgot.

19:42.721 --> 19:44.079
The house?

19:44.567 --> 19:47.362
Early. Richard said you were there.

19:47.810 --> 19:49.931
I was. At the house early.

19:50.975 --> 19:52.442
To see Harlan?

19:53.597 --> 19:56.024
To see Harlan. Yes.

19:57.625 --> 19:59.645
What were you seeing Harlan about?

20:00.426 --> 20:04.769
It was just a mix up
with the payment for Meg's tuition.

20:06.356 --> 20:10.885
I'm sorry to press,
what kind of mix up?

20:12.852 --> 20:16.218
The school hasn't got the check yet,
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it.

20:16.218 --> 20:20.272
Well, Alan didn't mail it
because he caught a discrepancy.

20:21.335 --> 20:26.724
Alan's office has been wiring tuition
directly to the school, as per your request.

20:26.883 --> 20:30.296
But Phyllis's office,
that handles your yearly allowance,

20:30.296 --> 20:34.221
has been wiring the tuition money
directly to you as well.

20:35.287 --> 20:39.286
You have been double dipping Meg's tuition,
and stealing from me.

20:39.859 --> 20:44.064
100 thousand dollars a year.
For the past four years.

20:44.064 --> 20:46.457
Harlan, I don't know how this mix up
happened, but...

20:46.457 --> 20:49.537
So, now I am writing this tuition check,

20:49.694 --> 20:55.646
but you must know that this is
the last money you or Meg will get from me.

20:55.844 --> 20:57.197
Please, you don't understand.

20:57.197 --> 21:00.898
Joni, I know it'll hurt,
but it's all for the best.

21:02.424 --> 21:04.350
My mind's made up.

21:06.753 --> 21:10.699
It was a money wiring issue
with the office at the school.

21:10.829 --> 21:14.315
So, I had to ask Harlan
to cut a check for this semester.

21:14.484 --> 21:15.842
No big deal.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.834
Why don't we just take
a little break and we'll resume...

21:22.019 --> 21:24.049
She's gone.

21:30.946 --> 21:32.442
Richard.

21:33.598 --> 21:35.068
Joni. Have you seen Richard?

21:35.068 --> 21:36.573
No, I was just in with the...

21:36.573 --> 21:38.164
Okay, thanks.

21:39.536 --> 21:40.868
No.

21:41.327 --> 21:42.981
Goddammit! Richard!

21:45.071 --> 21:46.540
Richard.

22:15.671 --> 22:17.653
Son of a bitch!

22:28.021 --> 22:30.782
I might be a victim
of my own expectations here.

22:30.782 --> 22:33.866
But when the great Benoit Blanc
comes knocking at my door

22:34.623 --> 22:40.262
I expect it's going to be about something, if
not extraordinary, then at least interesting.

22:41.303 --> 22:44.530
I'm sorry, this is an
open and shut case of suicide and...

22:45.008 --> 22:48.114
Quite frankly, Benny, we're getting to the point
where I need to know what we're doing here.

22:48.114 --> 22:49.719
The method.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.321
Throat slit.

22:52.901 --> 22:54.920
Typical for a suicide?

22:54.920 --> 22:57.577
I mean, that's dramatic. But look around.

22:58.740 --> 23:01.362
I mean, the guy practically lives
in a clue board.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.764
You told me
to invite all of these people back

23:13.113 --> 23:15.887
for questioning all over again.
I don't get it.

23:21.668 --> 23:26.136
This is a pleasant family with the usual
quarrels, but no possible motives for murder.

23:26.435 --> 23:28.114
Where are you going?

23:32.271 --> 23:34.878
Harlan Thrombey's nurse, Marta...

23:35.386 --> 23:37.151
- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera.

23:37.151 --> 23:39.025
Miss Cabrera, you can just wait inside
and we'll be...

23:39.025 --> 23:40.485
Miss Cabrera.

23:43.371 --> 23:45.313
I've been doing a little poking.

23:45.955 --> 23:49.605
You are hired on a part time basis
as a registered nurse, yes?

23:49.789 --> 23:53.866
Yes, I don't work for a VNA.
Harlan hired me directly.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.341
Take a seat, please.

23:56.034 --> 24:01.244
And you're paid a flat rate
for how many hours a week?

24:02.769 --> 24:05.568
Well, I started at 15, and then he...

24:06.695 --> 24:09.088
- He needed more help.
- Medical help?

24:11.989 --> 24:13.601
He needed a friend.

24:15.841 --> 24:19.980
Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?

24:20.393 --> 24:22.485
All right, Blanc, I mean.
This is...

24:22.485 --> 24:26.525
Marta, we were just discussing
possible motives in the family.

24:26.832 --> 24:31.646
I suspect that Harlan has told you
much unfiltered truth about each of them.

24:31.646 --> 24:34.385
And a little bird has told me,

24:34.934 --> 24:37.238
how should I put this delicately?

24:38.305 --> 24:44.031
You have a regurgitive reaction
to mistruthin'.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.642
Who told you that?

24:46.642 --> 24:48.334
Is it true?

24:50.660 --> 24:52.073
Yes.

24:52.236 --> 24:54.504
It's something I had
since I was a kid.

24:54.504 --> 24:56.694
It's a physically thing that I...

24:57.032 --> 25:00.947
Just the thought of lying,
yeah, it makes me puke.

25:01.213 --> 25:02.627
Really?

25:06.566 --> 25:08.800
Is Richard having an affair?

25:13.131 --> 25:18.886
Why do men instinctively
pull at loose threads on their parachutes?

25:19.606 --> 25:20.932
What?

25:28.497 --> 25:29.910
Richard?

25:31.496 --> 25:33.239
An affair?

25:34.097 --> 25:36.444
A <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> will do.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.925
No.

25:44.509 --> 25:45.899
Oh shit!

25:46.210 --> 25:49.771
Dear girl I'm sorry. I assumed you
were speaking figuratively.

25:50.975 --> 25:53.666
Here, here. Just take a sip of this.

25:53.666 --> 25:55.907
Take that. Quite something.

25:57.072 --> 25:58.974
But I was obviously right.

25:59.640 --> 26:03.205
Richard is having an affair, his
father-in-law found out and confronted him.

26:03.255 --> 26:04.632
"You tell her or I will."

26:04.632 --> 26:06.475
Okay, but even if that was a case...

26:06.771 --> 26:08.258
- You all right?
- Yeah.

26:08.258 --> 26:09.745
Even if that was a case, I mean,

26:09.745 --> 26:12.790
protecting a relationship as a motive,
that's weak sauce, you know that.

26:12.790 --> 26:15.064
Well. And then there is Joni.

26:15.366 --> 26:17.766
Joni? Lifestyle guru Joni?

26:17.766 --> 26:20.528
No. Harlan was supporting her and her daughter,
and that's the opposite of a motive.

26:20.528 --> 26:23.459
And if that support was threatened?
Miss Cabrera one moment please.

26:23.459 --> 26:24.952
Yes, I just wanna
get some Scope.

26:24.952 --> 26:26.285
Miss Cabrera.

26:27.333 --> 26:31.192
Was Harlan planning on
cutting off Joni's allowance?

26:33.460 --> 26:35.353
Oh, Joni.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.038
What's up?

26:41.057 --> 26:42.112
Oh my God.

26:42.288 --> 26:43.839
Don't answer that
if you're gonna puke again.

26:43.839 --> 26:48.373
Meg said he paid the school directly,
Joni said he sends the money to her.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.016
Both were true.

26:50.362 --> 26:55.669
She was pocketing the double payment. Harlan
found out and cut her off without a cent. Yes?

26:56.254 --> 26:59.286
So she bumps him off
for the inheritance?

26:59.338 --> 27:02.425
Come on! No. Have you seen
her insta? She's an influencer.

27:02.425 --> 27:05.655
No. Allowance as a motive?
Again, more weak sauce.

27:05.878 --> 27:07.632
You're just dumping that bag
of weak sauce on it.

27:07.632 --> 27:09.853
Granted. But she lied to me.

27:10.512 --> 27:12.085
All three of them did.

27:12.085 --> 27:13.164
Three?

27:14.686 --> 27:15.854
Walter.

27:16.838 --> 27:18.076
I see where you are going with this.

27:18.076 --> 27:20.814
Harlan had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights.

27:20.814 --> 27:23.725
But that night something Harlan said
shook him.

27:23.725 --> 27:27.195
Now, we look at the pattern.
Harlan was cleaning house.

27:28.303 --> 27:29.621
I wonder...

27:30.031 --> 27:32.105
Did he plan to fire Walter?

27:32.105 --> 27:34.386
Can I wait inside?
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.885
Yeah, please just wait inside,
stay close, all right?

27:41.759 --> 27:43.783
You have been very patient my friend.

27:44.793 --> 27:47.445
And yes. You are right.

27:47.445 --> 27:51.677
None of these weak alibis and domestic
squibbles answer your question:

27:51.677 --> 27:54.073
Why is Benoit Blanc here?

27:55.017 --> 27:57.139
Well, now I will tell you why.

27:58.046 --> 28:03.185
I'm here because this morning
someone dodged a very important question.

28:03.853 --> 28:05.042
Who?

28:05.580 --> 28:08.939
Me. Linda asked who hired me.

28:10.307 --> 28:11.620
Who hired you?

28:11.814 --> 28:13.640
I do not know.

28:14.394 --> 28:17.152
An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday,

28:17.152 --> 28:19.491
with the news,
clipping of Thrombey's death.

28:19.491 --> 28:21.158
An envelope? That worked?

28:22.821 --> 28:24.613
An envelope of cash.

28:25.655 --> 28:28.276
So, somebody suspects foul play,

28:28.276 --> 28:32.870
and goes through this ha cha dance
of hiring me, of staying anonymous.

28:33.585 --> 28:36.336
It makes no damn sense.

28:37.798 --> 28:39.587
Compels me though.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.308
Walk me through everyone's
whereabouts at the time of death.

28:45.550 --> 28:48.573
We know that the party
ended around 11:30.

28:49.016 --> 28:49.889
Goodnight, Joni.

28:49.889 --> 28:52.547
Marta took Harlan upstairs
to give him his meds.

28:54.512 --> 28:59.276
The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom
and his attic office creak horribly.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.755
And Linda is a light sleeper.

29:01.755 --> 29:04.514
So we know every time someone
took the stairs that night.

29:07.628 --> 29:12.025
The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk
from somewhere above her in the house.

29:21.282 --> 29:24.745
She's concerned about Harlan,
so she goes up to investigate,

29:26.065 --> 29:27.678
waking Linda.

29:28.228 --> 29:30.226
Harlan was in his attic office with Marta.

29:30.272 --> 29:32.162
- Hi, Joni.
- I just... Hi.

29:32.162 --> 29:34.108
He explained that they
had just knocked over the GO board.

29:34.108 --> 29:35.707
I just knocked over the GO board.

29:35.707 --> 29:39.663
That game with the grid and stones,
they play it every night, and he was fine.

29:39.663 --> 29:41.871
- Go to bed.
- Go to bed, Joni.

29:41.976 --> 29:43.189
- Love you.
- Love you.

29:43.189 --> 29:44.565
So she did.

29:45.936 --> 29:49.340
Ten minutes later,
Linda is awoken a second time

29:51.312 --> 29:52.456
by Marta leaving.

29:52.456 --> 29:54.009
Walt, I'm leaving!

29:54.529 --> 29:56.963
Walt was smoking a cigar
on the porch with his son.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.210
He saw her leave and drive off.

30:00.277 --> 30:02.668
Noted the time - midnight.

30:09.363 --> 30:13.720
Fifteen minutes later, Linda is awoken
for the third and final time

30:15.993 --> 30:18.077
by someone coming down the stairs.

30:18.077 --> 30:20.455
Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.

30:20.604 --> 30:22.110
Dad, go to bed!

30:22.288 --> 30:24.385
Which Walt tried to discourage.

30:25.192 --> 30:31.197
Based on this, the medical examiner determined
the time of death to be between 12:15 and 2 AM.

30:31.197 --> 30:35.042
As Walt was finishing his cigar,
about 12:30, Meg came home.

30:35.189 --> 30:39.107
She went straight to bed. Walt and
Jacob turned in shortly after that.

30:41.424 --> 30:46.226
Sometime later that night,
it's undetermined, but possibly near 3 AM,

30:46.647 --> 30:49.570
Meg woke up because the dogs
were barking outside.

30:49.570 --> 30:52.354
She used the bathroom,
went back to bed.

30:52.808 --> 30:54.583
That's it, all right?

30:54.583 --> 30:58.285
Everyone's stories matched,
every moment accounted for.

30:59.367 --> 31:02.682
And there is no other staircase
up to Harlan's room?

31:02.696 --> 31:04.566
None. Just the creaky one.

31:04.566 --> 31:05.759
Interesting.

31:05.759 --> 31:09.821
So, we know that Ransom didn't do it
because he wasn't there.

31:09.966 --> 31:13.533
Marta couldn't have.
Harlan was still alive when she left.

31:13.710 --> 31:17.479
Meg? Meg came home during the window
of the time of death.

31:17.479 --> 31:21.934
Except it was a suicide, all right?
Harlan slit right through his carotid.

31:21.934 --> 31:25.071
We saw from the blood splat patterns
that they were uninterrupted,

31:25.071 --> 31:28.769
meaning, It's almost impossible for anyone
to have been around him at the time.

31:30.051 --> 31:32.653
He's the one who cut his own throat, all right?
I don't know why we keep going over this.

31:32.653 --> 31:37.021
Physical evidence can tell
a clear story with a forked tongue.

31:37.021 --> 31:38.349
What?

31:38.349 --> 31:42.754
And as we can see from this morning.
Everyone can lie.

31:44.478 --> 31:47.420
Well. Almost everyone.

31:49.754 --> 31:51.268
Miss Cabrera.

31:52.311 --> 31:56.041
We kept you waiting all afternoon
because I wanted to hear from you last.

31:57.359 --> 32:01.043
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head.

32:01.888 --> 32:05.533
Your piece of it
is at its very center.

32:06.776 --> 32:09.381
So please, take your time.

32:11.284 --> 32:17.702
You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs
at 11:30, and left at midnight.

32:18.337 --> 32:23.464
Think very carefully
and with as much detail as possible.

32:24.319 --> 32:27.143
Tell us what happened
in that half hour.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.504
- I got it.
- You got it?

32:34.944 --> 32:36.282
I got it.

32:36.934 --> 32:38.936
Okay, that's... Hey.

32:39.188 --> 32:41.440
Harlan. Let's...

32:42.674 --> 32:44.531
There are no second thoughts!

32:44.715 --> 32:46.236
No, no.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.981
- Get up here!
- I had dose of champagne.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.119
You only had one glass.

32:51.458 --> 32:55.046
We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!

32:55.046 --> 32:57.448
Can you just take your
goddamn medicine and go to bed?

32:57.448 --> 33:02.456
If you're gonna put that vile shit in me
you'll have to earn it. On my birthday.

33:02.456 --> 33:05.002
- 85th birthday.
- Fine, Jesus.

33:05.002 --> 33:06.702
I'm so old.

33:07.336 --> 33:09.016
You really love drama, huh?

33:10.306 --> 33:13.277
Okay, let's do this, 9 by 9.
You ready?

33:13.502 --> 33:15.067
- I'll whip your ass.
- Are you sure?

33:16.488 --> 33:18.044
How dare you?

33:20.398 --> 33:22.138
I know how this is gonna end.

33:23.385 --> 33:24.768
What is that?

33:24.768 --> 33:26.589
Why can't I beat you at this game?

33:26.589 --> 33:29.662
Because I'm not playing to beat you,
I'm playing to built a beautiful pattern.

33:29.662 --> 33:32.843
That's elder abuse.
I'm gonna call the AARP.

33:32.843 --> 33:34.705
Don't make me get the belt,
I would, you know.

33:34.705 --> 33:36.486
It's basically over.

33:37.278 --> 33:39.428
My only hope is
that an earthquake will strike.

33:40.407 --> 33:42.385
But what are the chances?

33:45.652 --> 33:47.378
Hello?

33:48.963 --> 33:50.636
Get under a door frame!

33:55.695 --> 33:58.935
Such a bad loser you are.
Meds, then bed.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.665
I'm done with you.

34:01.288 --> 34:02.571
That's fair.

34:05.684 --> 34:10.539
Walt is smoking that filthy cigar
out there on the porch. Nasty things.

34:12.422 --> 34:13.756
How was tonight?

34:13.756 --> 34:16.039
Tonight was good.

34:16.761 --> 34:20.081
Oh, yeah? I know you weren't
looking forward to it.

34:20.081 --> 34:24.911
No. But I did it.
I cut the line on all four of them.

34:27.707 --> 34:32.415
It wasn't easy. This goddamn fortune.

34:34.443 --> 34:37.730
You know, sometimes I think that
everything I've given my family,

34:37.730 --> 34:43.567
I've done maybe, without knowing,
or maybe, to keep them beneath me.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.346
I certainly should have...
I don't know...

34:47.688 --> 34:51.258
encouraged Walt to write
his own stories,

34:51.258 --> 34:55.166
not just be a caretaker of mine.

34:55.377 --> 34:57.182
Like you said I should.

34:57.588 --> 35:02.639
And then be a father, not just a provider
for Joni, like you've also said.

35:02.962 --> 35:06.267
I could've been kinder
to Linda and Ransom.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.307
Jesus, Ransom.

35:11.198 --> 35:14.671
There's so much of me in that kid.

35:15.732 --> 35:19.259
Confident, stupid, I dunno.

35:19.259 --> 35:25.271
Protected. Playing life like a game
without consequence,

35:27.399 --> 35:29.659
until you can't tell the difference

35:30.265 --> 35:34.554
between a stage prop
and a real knife.

35:36.239 --> 35:38.053
I don't fear death.

35:38.575 --> 35:43.847
But, oh God, I'd like to fix
some of this before I go.

35:44.222 --> 35:46.386
Close the book with a flourish.

35:49.634 --> 35:51.258
I guess we'll see.

35:52.129 --> 35:53.660
I guess we will.

35:58.829 --> 35:59.882
Hey.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.837
You had a long day.
You wanna do drugs.

36:04.465 --> 36:06.646
- You mean the good stuff?
- Yeah.

36:07.731 --> 36:11.347
Come on, send me to lala land.

36:11.347 --> 36:13.444
Just a tiny bit, okay?

36:13.896 --> 36:16.988
Why did I wait till my mid 80s
to become a morphine user.

36:16.988 --> 36:19.980
What a schmuck.
What a nud-nig.

36:21.449 --> 36:22.779
This stuff is the best.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.097
Oh my god!

36:31.064 --> 36:32.488
Is there a problem?

36:35.157 --> 36:37.840
This is what I just gave you
a 100 milligrams of.

36:39.219 --> 36:40.607
I messed up.

36:40.907 --> 36:44.395
You gave me a 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?

36:46.681 --> 36:50.816
Excuse me, but what is the good stuff's
dosage supposed to be?

36:51.018 --> 36:54.039
Let's not call it that right now, okay?
Three milligrams.

36:54.196 --> 36:57.347
That's much less. So what happens?

36:58.024 --> 37:01.967
I'm gonna give you an emergency shot of
Naloxone, so that you don't die in ten minutes.

37:02.038 --> 37:03.377
Well, no pressure.

37:04.811 --> 37:07.578
You know, this is
an interesting and efficient

37:08.091 --> 37:10.653
method of murder.
I need to write this down.

37:11.026 --> 37:16.591
So, if someone switched the meds
on purpose, I'd be dead in ten minutes.

37:17.213 --> 37:18.873
Like stone cold dead?

37:18.873 --> 37:22.459
Yes, you'll feel symptoms in five.
Sweats, disorientation, and then...

37:23.571 --> 37:26.357
Yes, that big dose injected,
within ten your

37:27.052 --> 37:30.615
Your brain... Yes, ten minutes.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.746
Yeah, from the moment of injection.

37:33.048 --> 37:34.447
It's eightish now.

37:34.447 --> 37:38.732
And even if the victim called for an
ambulance when he first felt symptoms,

37:38.732 --> 37:42.232
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do.

37:42.232 --> 37:47.776
The ambulance would take at least
15 minutes to arrive, it'd be too late.

37:48.941 --> 37:52.570
If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.

37:54.106 --> 37:57.555
Marta. Do you have the Naxostuff?

37:57.555 --> 37:59.489
Yes, I'm gonna find it.

37:59.794 --> 38:05.286
I have it because it comes with the kit, it
should be here, it has to be, it's like a...

38:15.118 --> 38:19.177
It's not here, Harlan.
I don't know, it's not here.

38:19.177 --> 38:21.106
So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay?

38:21.814 --> 38:23.566
To call an ambulance.

38:36.552 --> 38:37.986
What are you doing?

38:39.867 --> 38:41.478
What are you doing?

38:43.069 --> 38:45.036
Marta, listen to me.

38:45.172 --> 38:46.046
Harlan, I need to...

38:46.046 --> 38:49.484
Stop this! Stop this, Marta!
There is no time, you have to listen!

38:49.484 --> 38:50.982
I'm calling the family!

38:55.409 --> 38:57.687
What are you doing?
Are you nuts?

38:58.293 --> 39:00.540
Harlan, we have to call the ambulance,
we don't have time!

39:00.540 --> 39:01.889
Listen to me!

39:03.015 --> 39:06.060
If what you said is true,
I'm gone, there's no saving me.

39:06.780 --> 39:08.332
We have six minutes.

39:08.921 --> 39:12.576
We have got to get you out of this.
Think of your mom.

39:13.138 --> 39:14.416
My mom?

39:16.359 --> 39:18.733
Get behind, get behind.
Don't make a noise.

39:19.583 --> 39:20.582
Harlan?

39:21.425 --> 39:23.786
Marta? Everything all right?

39:24.576 --> 39:26.651
- Hi, Joni.
- Hi.

39:26.839 --> 39:28.908
I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?

39:29.282 --> 39:30.655
We're fine.

39:31.567 --> 39:34.962
I just knocked over
the GO board, sorry about that.

39:35.154 --> 39:36.223
Everyone's all right?

39:36.223 --> 39:38.994
Yes, fine. Go to bed Joni.

39:38.994 --> 39:43.312
Okay. Maybe, we can talk tomorrow
about the thing with..

39:43.312 --> 39:44.844
Tomorrow is fine.

39:45.187 --> 39:46.382
- Love you.
- Love you.

39:46.382 --> 39:48.231
Night.

39:51.256 --> 39:52.728
Come on.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.074
Pay attention now.

39:55.575 --> 39:58.874
Your mom is still undocumented,

39:58.874 --> 40:00.542
and if this is your fault

40:00.694 --> 40:05.288
she'll be found out and, at best, deported,
and your family will be broken.

40:05.288 --> 40:07.667
But we're not gonna let
that happen, are we?

40:08.163 --> 40:10.732
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

40:11.232 --> 40:13.139
Will you do this Marta?

40:14.693 --> 40:19.244
This last thing.
For me. For your family.

40:22.748 --> 40:24.647
What do you want me to do?

40:25.884 --> 40:30.432
Go downstairs as noisily as you can,
and then say goodbye loudly.

40:30.432 --> 40:31.440
Walt! I'm leaving!

40:31.440 --> 40:32.850
Call attention to the time.

40:32.850 --> 40:34.089
God, it's midnight already.

40:34.089 --> 40:35.394
If you can.

40:36.852 --> 40:40.131
Drive out the gate, then to avoid
the security cameras,

40:40.131 --> 40:43.535
pull off the road
before the carved elephant.

40:44.783 --> 40:46.884
Wait, was it before or after?

40:46.884 --> 40:48.310
<i>After</i> the carved elephant.

40:48.310 --> 40:50.397
No, he said before? Was it?

40:50.397 --> 40:52.055
<i>Beafterfore</i> the carved elephant.

40:52.055 --> 40:53.656
Oh, shit!

40:56.813 --> 41:00.212
Park and come back on foot
up to the house.

41:01.129 --> 41:04.050
Take the side yard path,
through that little gate.

41:04.945 --> 41:07.413
The dogs will know you,
they shouldn't bark.

41:08.698 --> 41:12.346
You've got to get up to the third floor
without being seen.

41:12.510 --> 41:17.528
And the only way is to climb the side trellis
and come in through the trick hall window.

41:17.934 --> 41:21.057
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I am not. Do it.

41:29.694 --> 41:32.486
And for God's sake
don't make any noise.

41:42.952 --> 41:45.628
Once you're inside.
Now, this is the tricky part.

41:45.922 --> 41:47.265
This is the tricky part?

41:47.535 --> 41:52.416
Get my robe and cap
from my bedroom, and put them on.

41:52.416 --> 41:55.397
Harlan, this is crazy.
I don't think I can do...

41:55.397 --> 41:57.005
We need to make this so airtight

41:57.005 --> 42:00.855
that the average cop
will entirely dismiss you as a suspect.

42:00.855 --> 42:03.086
It sounds crazy, but it will work.

42:07.666 --> 42:10.859
Walt is smoking outside,
and he'll see you

42:11.450 --> 42:13.023
through the glazed window.

42:13.023 --> 42:15.440
Dad, go back to bed.

42:16.630 --> 42:20.790
You were seen leaving,
the security cameras show you driving off.

42:20.790 --> 42:25.350
And twenty minutes later
I am seen alive and well by my son.

42:25.738 --> 42:30.519
You see, you've gone from suspect
number one to an impossibility.

42:30.838 --> 42:36.096
Leave the way you came,
and don't be seen.

42:46.124 --> 42:47.843
Ransom?

42:48.865 --> 42:51.310
Are you back again already?

42:54.700 --> 42:55.840
Drive home.

42:56.349 --> 43:00.530
And sometime, in the next few days
the police will question you.

43:00.534 --> 43:02.606
No, no, no.

43:03.201 --> 43:07.018
I can't lie, you know
I can't lie, I'll puke.

43:07.018 --> 43:08.260
Then don't lie.

43:08.260 --> 43:11.624
Tell fragments of the truth.
In this exact order:

43:18.737 --> 43:23.892
I took him upstairs,
we played our nightly game of GO.

43:25.421 --> 43:31.105
At some point he knocked the board over
and Joni came up to check on us.

43:34.804 --> 43:39.502
I gave him pain medication,
he pulled his shoulder last week.

43:41.395 --> 43:45.557
And I left him
in his study at midnight.

43:45.812 --> 43:48.178
I said goodbye to Walt.

43:49.353 --> 43:50.358
Went home.

43:50.358 --> 43:52.513
What kind of medication
did you give him?

43:55.710 --> 44:00.600
Since his injury I've been giving him
a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol.

44:00.716 --> 44:02.738
It's a non narcotic analgesic.

44:03.148 --> 44:07.153
And to help him sleep,
3 milligrams of morphine.

44:07.541 --> 44:10.379
- And the family was aware of this?
- Yes, of course.

44:10.624 --> 44:14.651
Did you notice anything strange,
off about his demeanor?

44:18.504 --> 44:20.035
No.

44:24.136 --> 44:26.203
Sounds about right.

44:26.878 --> 44:28.830
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

44:47.382 --> 44:50.796
Hey, sis, people are gonna start
getting here for the memorial pretty soon.

44:50.796 --> 44:52.589
Are you...?

44:54.812 --> 44:56.084
Are you all right?

44:56.540 --> 44:59.155
I was just thinking
about Dad's games.

45:00.863 --> 45:05.907
This all feels like one,
like something he'd write, not do.

45:07.079 --> 45:09.941
I keep waiting for the big reveal,

45:11.678 --> 45:16.422
where it all makes sense,
wouldn't that be nice?

45:17.117 --> 45:19.189
Walter.

45:21.341 --> 45:24.965
I don't think he killed himself.
I don't. I really don't.

45:25.563 --> 45:29.359
There's this Hallmark movie called
"Deadly By Surprise" with Danica McKellar.

45:29.680 --> 45:33.351
And she plays the wife,
who's getting poisoned by her husband.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.151
But he's doing it little by little,
so she doesn't know it.

45:36.306 --> 45:38.518
And she goes crazy
and she kills herself.

45:38.659 --> 45:41.999
And my cousin, who's a receptionist
at the medical examiners office.

45:42.127 --> 45:44.271
She says that stuff totally happens.

45:44.271 --> 45:47.883
Say, with 3% as crazy as this stuff
she's seen come through the...

45:50.232 --> 45:51.989
Oh, God. Yeah, I mean...

45:51.989 --> 45:53.969
You don't like him
because you love him.

45:54.104 --> 45:56.728
No, I don't like him,
he's an asshole.

45:56.963 --> 45:59.616
But maybe, an asshole is what we needed.

46:00.107 --> 46:01.058
God, yeah...

46:01.058 --> 46:04.733
An asshole is what Germany
needed in nineteen thirty... whatever.

46:04.910 --> 46:06.808
Those 2 things don't even complete.

46:07.641 --> 46:12.116
Jesus, I'm gonna disappear
until the politics talk is done.

46:12.116 --> 46:13.863
You want some champers?

46:14.399 --> 46:16.292
I can't. I'm technically working.

46:16.804 --> 46:19.263
Take off your red cap, Richard
and look around you.

46:19.263 --> 46:21.413
The streets
are literally flooded with Nazis.

46:21.413 --> 46:22.596
No, no, no.

46:22.596 --> 46:26.066
We're losing our way of life
and our culture.

46:26.237 --> 46:28.531
There are millions of Mexicans coming.

46:28.660 --> 46:31.507
And don't make this a race thing.
You always make this a race thing.

46:31.507 --> 46:35.171
I would say the same thing
if they were European immigrants.

46:35.171 --> 46:37.081
If the Swiss were like
clogging in the streets...

46:37.081 --> 46:39.963
We allow them in and
they think they own...

46:39.963 --> 46:44.005
They're putting children in cages.
I mean, these are camps!

46:44.005 --> 46:46.911
Come on, Joni.
Nobody's saying that isn't bad,

46:46.911 --> 46:48.690
but the parents
have some blame here.

46:48.742 --> 46:51.103
For what? For wanting a better life
for their kids?

46:51.103 --> 46:52.221
Isn't that what America is...?

46:52.221 --> 46:54.531
For breaking the law.

46:54.961 --> 46:57.669
And you gonna hate hearing this,
but it's true.

46:57.669 --> 46:59.733
- America is for Americans.
- Don't point at me!

46:59.733 --> 47:01.285
Where is Marta,
is she still here?

47:01.285 --> 47:05.591
Marta. Come on over.
Marta, please. Come over.

47:06.368 --> 47:11.549
Marta, your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

47:12.043 --> 47:15.895
What I'm saying is, they did it legally.
She did it the right way.

47:16.226 --> 47:20.189
You work hard, and you'll earn
your share from the ground up

47:20.189 --> 47:22.829
just like Dad
and like all the rest of us.

47:22.829 --> 47:24.405
And I bet
you agree with me, right?

47:24.405 --> 47:26.936
Just leave the poor girl
alone, Richard.

47:26.936 --> 47:29.590
It's okay, I just wanna
hear what she has to say.

47:29.590 --> 47:30.543
It's okay, Marta, you can speak.

47:30.543 --> 47:32.553
Oh, sweetheart, don't feel
pressured to answer.

47:32.890 --> 47:38.302
Look, if you wanna become an American,
there are legal ways to do it.

47:38.963 --> 47:42.615
But if you break the law,
it doesn't matter how good you heart is,

47:42.990 --> 47:45.359
you gotta face the consequences.

47:45.703 --> 47:47.872
Are you, goddamn, insane?

47:47.872 --> 47:49.947
- Hey!
- I warn you!

47:55.773 --> 47:58.954
So I ask her, I'm like, Tonya,
what is wrong with people literally?

47:59.687 --> 48:01.591
Oh my God, Marta. What?

48:02.118 --> 48:04.293
Marta! What's the matter?

48:04.638 --> 48:08.275
Whoa, hey. Breathe.
Marta, are you okay?

48:09.896 --> 48:12.053
Hey, Fran, do you still have
your stash?

48:17.696 --> 48:19.176
Take 'em whenever you need 'em.

48:19.176 --> 48:21.324
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

48:21.643 --> 48:22.987
Thanks Fran.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.092
Hey.

48:24.092 --> 48:27.021
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm very very sorry.

48:27.021 --> 48:29.613
Stop. Stop saying
you're sorry, Jesus.

48:29.974 --> 48:32.110
God, my heart won't stop, I can't...

48:33.795 --> 48:36.021
It's just everything.
No, thank you.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.487
That's where Fran keeps her stash?

48:42.319 --> 48:43.734
Who's gonna open a clock?

48:45.329 --> 48:50.246
Do you want dinner, Nana?
Dinner? To eat? To eat?

48:52.150 --> 48:54.998
Walt, she's fine, she ate
the entire salmon spread already.

48:57.063 --> 48:59.707
Walt, did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

48:59.707 --> 49:01.479
No, not yet.
Is now a good time?

49:01.479 --> 49:03.662
Yes, yes a very good time.
Right now.

49:03.943 --> 49:07.803
Okay, all right.
Calm down. Calm down.

49:09.514 --> 49:13.555
Marta. We've been talking it over, and...

49:15.162 --> 49:17.188
Have you been smoking grass?

49:17.188 --> 49:19.506
No. Come on.

49:19.841 --> 49:22.171
Marta, we've been talking it over,

49:22.171 --> 49:26.189
the whole family,
we'd like to take care of you.

49:27.812 --> 49:29.059
What does that mean?

49:30.030 --> 49:31.923
We all think
that you deserve something.

49:31.923 --> 49:34.480
Financially, we'd like to help you out.

49:34.480 --> 49:36.692
You were never anything
but good to dad.

49:37.790 --> 49:41.644
Because of that
you can count on us.

49:46.276 --> 49:50.763
I thought you should've been
at the funeral, by the way. I was outvoted.

50:01.786 --> 50:05.436
Detective, you're still here?

50:11.720 --> 50:13.364
Did you know Harlan?

50:13.557 --> 50:16.971
He knew my father,
who was a police detective, years ago.

50:19.139 --> 50:23.309
My father respected Harlan.
That says quite a lot.

50:23.732 --> 50:25.204
Is that why you're here?

50:26.503 --> 50:29.036
Here, now here? No.

50:30.260 --> 50:32.608
I stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more.

50:37.927 --> 50:41.039
Something is afoot
with this whole affair.

50:42.491 --> 50:45.858
I know it, and I believe
you know it too.

50:47.937 --> 50:49.716
So, you're gonna keep digging.

50:50.578 --> 50:57.069
Harlan's detectives, they dig,
they rifle and root, truffle pigs.

50:59.001 --> 51:02.888
I anticipate the terminus
of gravity's rainbow.

51:03.899 --> 51:05.650
Gravity's Rainbow?

51:05.650 --> 51:08.319
- It's a novel.
- Yeah, I know.

51:08.830 --> 51:11.193
- I haven't read it though.
- Neither have I.

51:11.193 --> 51:13.753
Nobody has. But I like the title.

51:14.707 --> 51:18.970
It describes the path of a projectile,
determined by natural law.

51:19.297 --> 51:21.101
I Voilà, my method.

51:21.785 --> 51:25.304
I observe the facts,
without biases of the head or heart.

51:25.820 --> 51:29.747
I determine the arc's path,
stroll leisurely to its terminus,

51:30.543 --> 51:32.889
and the truth falls at my feet.

51:35.898 --> 51:38.937
The medical examiner
was ready to rule this a suicide,

51:38.937 --> 51:42.278
but Elliott agreed
to keep it pending for 48 hours.

51:42.723 --> 51:46.774
Tomorrow morning I search the grounds
and the house, begin my investigation.

51:48.028 --> 51:50.261
I want you to be
by my side for it.

51:50.261 --> 51:50.848
What?

51:50.848 --> 51:52.730
My confidant, my eyes and ears.

51:52.730 --> 51:54.665
Wait, detective. Why me?

51:54.665 --> 51:57.036
I trust your kind heart.

51:59.016 --> 52:02.265
Also, you're the only one who had
nothing to gain from Harlan's death.

52:03.375 --> 52:05.297
So, how about it, Watson?

52:05.893 --> 52:09.478
Detective, if you want my insight
into this family.

52:10.748 --> 52:14.056
None of them are murderers.
That's my insight.

52:14.327 --> 52:17.890
And yet. Be it cruel or comforting,

52:18.592 --> 52:22.028
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.

52:23.064 --> 52:24.608
That's what it does.

52:26.010 --> 52:27.382
Always?

52:28.307 --> 52:30.070
Tomorrow at 8.

53:00.488 --> 53:03.580
I know I missed something,
there's gonna be something I missed.

53:03.580 --> 53:05.616
- But I know you can beat it
- No, I can't...

53:05.616 --> 53:10.440
without losing your soul you have to do
what you have to do to beat this and win.

53:10.440 --> 53:11.896
Harlan, I can't.

53:11.896 --> 53:14.026
You can and you have to.

53:15.275 --> 53:17.863
For me. Right now!

53:37.644 --> 53:39.507
Harlan, I have to get you help.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.779
You do as I say

53:43.416 --> 53:46.394
- and everything will be just fine.
- God, no.

53:47.986 --> 53:50.073
I promise.

53:50.073 --> 53:52.073
Please...

55:00.382 --> 55:03.026
Fifty years ago I worked at this estate.

55:03.396 --> 55:09.765
You know, security back then was such
that you had to make the rounds with a 94

55:10.087 --> 55:12.342
and keeping your ears open.

55:12.895 --> 55:16.528
Now, you got all this
modern technology.

55:18.133 --> 55:22.282
That's the video there,
I saved the tape from that night.

55:22.455 --> 55:25.944
Normally, I erase 'em
with the magnetic de-gauser.

55:25.944 --> 55:28.995
But in this case I thought
I just save it, you know?

55:29.203 --> 55:33.452
For security. That's the live feed there.

55:34.958 --> 55:39.730
To avoid the security cameras, pull
off the road <i>after</i> the carved elephant.

55:39.730 --> 55:41.929
All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?

55:41.929 --> 55:43.694
Of course, you can.

55:43.902 --> 55:50.300
I recorded it SSLP.
There's 8 hours on that tape, 9 PM to 5 AM.

56:00.398 --> 56:02.299
Looks like a Japanese horror movie.

56:02.299 --> 56:04.574
You think we can scan forward on that?

56:05.681 --> 56:07.111
How can we scan forward?

56:07.307 --> 56:13.001
Just hold the play button down
and press FF until you hear it grind.

56:19.189 --> 56:22.696
All right, should be coming up now
at the time when the party ended.

56:25.801 --> 56:26.782
What happened?

56:26.782 --> 56:29.856
You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.

56:29.925 --> 56:32.175
That thing eats tapes like popcorn.

56:32.175 --> 56:35.592
You think your guys can digitize it,
so we can scan it properly?

56:35.592 --> 56:37.377
Yeah, I think we can do that.

56:37.945 --> 56:39.397
I got it.

56:41.658 --> 56:43.665
You know, all these statues
that you see around here,

56:43.817 --> 56:48.121
they are all straight out of his series "The
Menagerie Tragedy" trilogy, pretty cool.

56:48.283 --> 56:50.118
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

56:50.671 --> 56:52.864
Benny. It's beautiful out here.

56:52.864 --> 56:55.589
But do you really think someone
broken into the house and murdered Harlan?

56:55.589 --> 56:56.897
Is that why we're out here?

56:56.897 --> 57:00.656
It is unlikely, but if they did,
there will be traces.

57:01.076 --> 57:02.990
- I can take on that.
- Yeah.

57:11.617 --> 57:14.289
Hey Wagner, you got any luck on...

57:15.919 --> 57:17.047
- What's his name?
- Ransom?

57:17.047 --> 57:17.926
Yeah.

57:18.089 --> 57:19.329
No.

57:20.401 --> 57:24.833
Did get an address though.
10 Kenoak street.

57:25.725 --> 57:29.045
Ten Kenoak. Kenoak.

57:30.310 --> 57:32.482
It's a pleasant thing to say, isn't it?

57:32.854 --> 57:38.207
Kenoak. I awoke
amid Kenoak. That's funny.

57:38.207 --> 57:42.376
Always leaves and mud,
they really gonna do a number on my boots.

57:42.731 --> 57:45.307
Mud, has it rained the past week?

57:46.046 --> 57:47.807
- No. Stay there!
- What?

57:48.739 --> 57:51.062
Okay. We got footprints here.

57:51.062 --> 57:53.273
So, I wanna...

57:53.819 --> 57:56.512
- Marta, stop.
- What?

57:57.244 --> 57:57.893
What?

57:57.893 --> 57:59.681
- Marta, stay there.
- What?

57:59.681 --> 58:02.276
No, Marta, stay there, Marta! No!

58:02.878 --> 58:04.100
Did you call me?

58:04.100 --> 58:05.675
Excuse me.

58:05.675 --> 58:08.031
Wagner, we gonna need to call the boys,
so they come down here

58:08.031 --> 58:10.368
and take a look at
all these tracks, get it taped off.

58:10.368 --> 58:12.146
- Stay on that side.
- I'm sorry.

58:14.914 --> 58:16.314
Hey.

58:20.081 --> 58:24.532
Best judge of character is a dog.
I found that to be true.

58:33.739 --> 58:36.164
They've got plans
to read the will at around 10.

58:37.205 --> 58:39.047
The whole family will be here soon.

58:41.617 --> 58:43.406
I've never been to a will reading.

58:44.658 --> 58:46.654
You think it'll be like a game show.

58:47.276 --> 58:51.390
Think of a community theater
production of a tax return.

58:52.839 --> 58:54.701
So, what are we looking for?

58:54.701 --> 58:58.616
Oh, you know, anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

58:59.223 --> 59:00.898
You'll know it when you see it.

59:01.726 --> 59:03.189
Oh my God!

59:03.875 --> 59:05.704
Sweet beans!

59:09.540 --> 59:13.207
Well, good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

59:22.309 --> 59:24.352
You think you could
handle the study?

59:34.029 --> 59:36.118
Where's your medical bag?

59:36.402 --> 59:40.353
I don't know. I left it here. I always
leave it here with Harlan at night.

59:40.353 --> 59:43.186
They must've taken it in
as evidence. I'll look into that.

59:49.022 --> 59:50.434
Shit.

59:52.800 --> 59:55.295
How'd the GO board get knocked over?

59:55.482 --> 59:57.355
We were just goofing around.

59:58.962 --> 01:00:00.653
What are you thinking?

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:17.507
No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey!

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:19.628
Let me guess.

01:00:19.628 --> 01:00:21.622
Hey. Stop. Stop.

01:00:22.543 --> 01:00:23.721
Stop. Stop.

01:00:24.394 --> 01:00:25.929
Hugh Drysdale?

01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:29.495
Ransom. Call me Ransom.
It's my middle name.

01:00:29.632 --> 01:00:31.235
Only the help call me Hugh.

01:00:32.151 --> 01:00:36.220
Okay, this is Trooper Wagner,
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:38.670
We just wanna ask
a few questions.

01:00:42.769 --> 01:00:45.288
Excuse me. Sir?

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:47.848
We're officers of the law.

01:00:47.848 --> 01:00:50.934
You gonna run me in? I don't feel
like talking. I'm distraught.

01:00:51.487 --> 01:00:53.769
Hey Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?

01:00:53.769 --> 01:00:55.320
All right, what is this?
What's this arrangement?

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.783
Mr. Drysdale.

01:00:57.093 --> 01:00:59.255
CSI KFC?

01:01:04.145 --> 01:01:06.704
Hey Frannie, how about a glass
of cold milk?

01:01:07.052 --> 01:01:10.229
Hey asshole.
Not her name, Not her job.

01:01:10.554 --> 01:01:13.162
Hey Meg. How's your
SJW degree coming?

01:01:13.631 --> 01:01:16.137
- Trust fund prick.
- All right. Guys.

01:01:18.352 --> 01:01:19.860
Hey, everyone.

01:01:20.192 --> 01:01:24.491
I'm just gonna be in the other room,
setting up, be ready in 10 minutes.

01:01:30.238 --> 01:01:34.183
Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral,
but you're early for the will reading.

01:01:35.889 --> 01:01:38.929
Okay, people grieve
in different ways, let's not...

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:40.571
You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.

01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:43.428
Why are you even bothering?
That's what I'm asking myself.

01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:45.196
What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:45.196 --> 01:01:48.231
- He knows what it supposed to mean.
- Wait. Walt. What?

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:54.071
Jacob was in that bathroom
in the night of the party.

01:01:55.554 --> 01:01:57.511
Oh, that's where
you were all night?

01:01:57.511 --> 01:01:59.944
The hell were you doing in the
bathroom all night?

01:01:59.944 --> 01:02:01.985
- Nothing.
- Swatting Syrian refugees?

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:03.918
- No. I was not.
- Alt right troll.

01:02:03.918 --> 01:02:05.206
Liberal snowflake.

01:02:05.206 --> 01:02:06.847
I don't know
what any of that means.

01:02:06.847 --> 01:02:08.666
It means your son's
a little creep.

01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:11.314
Oh, my son's a creep?

01:02:11.314 --> 01:02:12.915
Guys! Just...

01:02:12.915 --> 01:02:14.588
Walt, he was in the bathroom.

01:02:14.588 --> 01:02:15.930
Yeah, he was in the bathroom,

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:18.930
joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.

01:02:20.014 --> 01:02:22.230
You know what, Richard?
You wanna go?

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:23.928
You bet, Skippy. Let's go!

01:02:24.078 --> 01:02:25.348
You wanna go? C'mon!

01:02:25.519 --> 01:02:26.815
You better watch out!

01:02:26.815 --> 01:02:28.080
Stop!

01:02:29.617 --> 01:02:32.145
C'mon, you had me
waiting for it my whole life!

01:02:32.145 --> 01:02:33.848
Stop it right now!

01:02:33.848 --> 01:02:36.059
I can handle myself!
I can handle it.

01:02:36.059 --> 01:02:37.549
Oh my God!

01:02:37.742 --> 01:02:39.581
We gotta do this more often.

01:02:39.581 --> 01:02:41.141
Hey!

01:02:41.308 --> 01:02:43.940
Jacob, we know
where this is going.

01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:46.298
You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,

01:02:46.298 --> 01:02:47.997
where he had the fight
with Ransom.

01:02:48.152 --> 01:02:50.525
Now, you heard something. Spill it.

01:02:52.795 --> 01:02:54.543
I just heard two things.

01:02:58.205 --> 01:02:59.489
...my will!

01:02:59.658 --> 01:03:01.246
My will.

01:03:01.433 --> 01:03:03.847
And then there was more yelling,

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:09.619
and then I heard
Ransom say "I'm warning you."

01:03:13.519 --> 01:03:16.271
Ransom? What's that mean?

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:19.129
I think that means our father
finally came to his senses

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:22.051
and cut this worthless little brat
out of his will.

01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:25.144
So, I guess you gonna have to
sell the Beamer,

01:03:25.144 --> 01:03:27.087
and give your notice
at the country club,

01:03:27.087 --> 01:03:29.531
and kick whatever fashion drugs
you're on.

01:03:29.697 --> 01:03:32.999
Because if you think that after
all the bridges you burned,

01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:35.788
After all the shit you said,
after everything that you put

01:03:35.788 --> 01:03:37.906
this family through
for the last 10 years,

01:03:37.906 --> 01:03:40.562
that any of us
are gonna support you,

01:03:40.562 --> 01:03:42.516
that any of us
are gonna give you,

01:03:42.516 --> 01:03:48.629
like dad liked to say,
a single red dime, you're nuts!

01:03:52.432 --> 01:03:53.662
Son.

01:03:54.673 --> 01:03:55.846
Father?

01:03:56.634 --> 01:03:59.980
Did Harlan tell you he was
gonna cut you out of the will?

01:04:01.869 --> 01:04:03.179
Yup.

01:04:06.107 --> 01:04:10.753
Well, then he's done what
none of us were strong enough to do.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:14.713
Maybe this might finally
make you grow up.

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.450
This might be the best thing
that could ever happen to you.

01:04:20.663 --> 01:04:22.988
Thank you. My mother,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:23.171 --> 01:04:26.926
Look, this is not gonna be easy
for you, but it'll be good.

01:04:27.505 --> 01:04:29.475
Nothing good is ever easy.

01:04:29.817 --> 01:04:30.935
Up your ass, Joni.

01:04:30.935 --> 01:04:33.321
You've got your teeth in this family's
tit for a long time.

01:04:33.321 --> 01:04:35.394
Up your ass? Very nice.

01:04:35.394 --> 01:04:38.287
Matter of fact -
eat shit, hows that?

01:04:39.099 --> 01:04:42.400
In fact, eat shit,
eat shit, eat shit.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.238
- You entitled prick!
- I would snap that smug smile...

01:04:45.238 --> 01:04:47.762
Definitely eat shit. Eat shit.

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:53.776
I own it, shit!

01:04:55.362 --> 01:04:57.918
What was that about
will readings being boring?

01:04:58.732 --> 01:05:00.921
Exception that proves the rule.

01:05:03.444 --> 01:05:04.942
Asshole.

01:05:05.709 --> 01:05:10.079
I'm warning you.
Ransom said "I'm warning you."

01:05:10.425 --> 01:05:13.160
You heard Ransom in there,
that's the kind of thing he says.

01:05:13.956 --> 01:05:15.762
You want this? You want this?

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:22.549
What do we have here?

01:05:27.982 --> 01:05:31.390
This looks like
a relatively fresh break.

01:05:31.669 --> 01:05:33.544
Yup. Right there.

01:05:34.185 --> 01:05:35.197
Wait a minute.

01:05:35.503 --> 01:05:39.652
That doesn't make sense.
Where's that window?

01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:44.027
How about some more cookies, you?
You want some more cookies?

01:05:45.555 --> 01:05:49.750
Hey, maybe Harlem left you
a cold glass of milk in his will, asshole!

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:54.074
Show me, but stay off the carpet.

01:06:09.027 --> 01:06:12.616
It's the trick window!
From "A Kill For All Seasons!"

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:14.542
Trooper, here, will you take this?

01:06:26.933 --> 01:06:29.350
Traces of dried mud.

01:06:29.874 --> 01:06:32.705
I suspect they go
the length of the hallway.

01:06:33.868 --> 01:06:35.062
Footprints?

01:06:35.062 --> 01:06:36.908
No, just traces.

01:06:37.087 --> 01:06:39.709
Depending on when this thing
was last cleaned,

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.831
this could've happened
at anytime, right?

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:46.039
No, that would not explain this.

01:06:46.779 --> 01:06:49.941
Analyze that mud.
It will match these traces.

01:06:50.486 --> 01:06:54.674
And you will find similar samples, leading
up the trellis on the outside of the house.

01:06:55.528 --> 01:06:59.584
On the night of the party, somebody who did
not want to be heard climbing those steps

01:06:59.743 --> 01:07:03.700
went to a great deal of trouble
to break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.271
The game is afoot, eh Watson?

01:07:18.114 --> 01:07:21.006
Well. Thank you all for
getting together like this,

01:07:21.006 --> 01:07:24.578
it isn't legally necessary,
but I thought because you're all in town

01:07:24.578 --> 01:07:26.247
and some of you are leaving soon...

01:07:26.247 --> 01:07:29.002
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:07:29.969 --> 01:07:35.023
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to
gently request that you all stay in town

01:07:35.182 --> 01:07:37.101
until the investigation is completed.

01:07:37.101 --> 01:07:40.551
He's gently requesting,
but we gotta make that an order.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.466
No one move
until we figure this all out.

01:07:42.897 --> 01:07:44.828
- What?
- Can we ask why?

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:46.266
- Has something changed?
- No.

01:07:46.266 --> 01:07:48.369
No it hasn't changed
or no we can't ask?

01:07:48.369 --> 01:07:51.400
Mr. Stevens, you may continue.

01:07:51.827 --> 01:07:57.242
Right. Well the other reason I thought
this gathering would be beneficial

01:07:57.414 --> 01:08:02.822
is because Harlan altered
his will a week before he died.

01:08:02.822 --> 01:08:08.536
He sealed, he asked me not to submit it to the
courts for probate until after his death.

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:13.230
If anyone is confused about anything,
we're all together, we can talk.

01:08:13.722 --> 01:08:17.363
Although, I don't imagine any of it
is going to be that complicated.

01:08:17.968 --> 01:08:19.823
Harlan's assets included

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:22.299
- The house.
- The house,

01:08:22.299 --> 01:08:23.843
which he owned outright.

01:08:25.091 --> 01:08:26.660
- Sixty million.
- Yes.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.313
Sixty million in various
cash accounts and investments.

01:08:30.477 --> 01:08:33.836
And, of course, the real asset -

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,
his publishing company.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.298
He also wrote up a statement when he was making
the changes and he wanted that read first.

01:08:45.986 --> 01:08:48.577
"Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni."

01:08:48.769 --> 01:08:51.548
Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

01:08:51.548 --> 01:08:54.133
No pleasure was taken
in the exclusion,

01:08:54.133 --> 01:08:58.860
and its purpose was not to sow greater
discord in the family, quite the opposite.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:03.110
Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness. But do accept it.

01:09:03.423 --> 01:09:05.703
"It's for the best, Dad."

01:09:19.225 --> 01:09:21.811
Wow, well, yeah.
Not too complex at all.

01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:24.079
This'll be quick.

01:09:25.053 --> 01:09:30.234
I, Harlan Thrombey, being of sound mind
and body, yada yada...

01:09:31.474 --> 01:09:35.535
I hereby direct that all my assets,
both liquid and otherwise,

01:09:35.693 --> 01:09:39.461
I leave in their entirety
to Marta Cabrera.

01:09:40.956 --> 01:09:43.691
My entire ownership
of Blood Like Wine publishing

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.688
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera.

01:09:46.861 --> 01:09:51.881
"The copyright of its catalog likewise
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera."

01:09:55.971 --> 01:09:57.258
What?

01:10:02.007 --> 01:10:04.755
No. That's not...

01:10:04.936 --> 01:10:06.124
No.

01:10:06.124 --> 01:10:08.371
That can't be.
Can I see that please, Alan?

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:09.670
- That's right.
- Please.

01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:10.816
This can't be legal.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.699
It's right.

01:10:12.768 --> 01:10:14.230
- You know, he's been...
- Oh my God!

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.503
Alan, it's a mistake.

01:10:16.503 --> 01:10:18.755
I don't know what to say,
we're his family, so...

01:10:19.307 --> 01:10:20.802
It's not possible!

01:10:20.862 --> 01:10:22.844
Are there safeguards against this?

01:10:26.035 --> 01:10:26.990
Harlan was...

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.819
In his final days
he was under weight of medication.

01:10:29.969 --> 01:10:32.027
Obviously, he wasn't...
I mean... I don't know...

01:10:33.015 --> 01:10:38.959
Alan, you can take this piece of paper
and shove it right up your ass and get out.

01:10:39.132 --> 01:10:41.185
And you cops too.
Out! Out!

01:10:41.476 --> 01:10:42.593
- Right now!
- Melinda.

01:10:42.593 --> 01:10:46.296
No, Richard, we need to talk,
we need to fight this thing.

01:10:46.296 --> 01:10:48.893
We're not going anywhere.
I said get out!

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:54.258
We're the Thrombeys goddammit!
This is still our house!

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:02.769
Sorry.

01:11:03.066 --> 01:11:05.714
"Likewise the house at 2 Deerborn Drive

01:11:05.714 --> 01:11:08.866
and all belongings therein
I leave to Marta Cabrera."

01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:13.394
You little bitch!

01:11:13.562 --> 01:11:16.164
You little bitch!

01:11:16.297 --> 01:11:19.326
Did you know about this?
Were you in this from the beginning?

01:11:19.326 --> 01:11:20.730
No, no, no!
I just wanna know!

01:11:21.147 --> 01:11:23.780
What were you doing?
Were you boinking my father?

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.719
"Boinking?"

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:27.556
I think everybody just needs to cool...

01:11:27.556 --> 01:11:30.537
You had sex with my grandpa.
You dirty anchor baby.

01:11:31.183 --> 01:11:33.524
In the meantime I'd maybe run.

01:11:34.354 --> 01:11:35.383
Marta.

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:37.267
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Talk to us.

01:11:37.872 --> 01:11:40.221
Marta, wait a minute.

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:42.324
I totally understand
how you must be feeling.

01:11:42.324 --> 01:11:43.191
You can talk to me.

01:11:43.191 --> 01:11:44.641
I don't know how this...

01:11:45.404 --> 01:11:46.789
I don't know.

01:11:50.429 --> 01:11:53.470
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he...

01:11:53.579 --> 01:11:56.405
Guys, I'm also confused,
I need to think.

01:11:56.405 --> 01:11:58.154
Marta! You listen...

01:11:58.584 --> 01:11:59.838
I can't catch up!

01:12:04.733 --> 01:12:06.538
I can't open the damn...

01:12:08.568 --> 01:12:12.080
Marta, you have to understand.
He is our father.

01:12:12.547 --> 01:12:15.129
Marta, don't listen to them. I'm here.

01:12:15.308 --> 01:12:17.084
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:21.586
So, de-add me on Instagram, okay?
I wanna talk to you.

01:12:28.547 --> 01:12:29.615
What's going on?

01:12:29.615 --> 01:12:32.320
I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you!

01:12:34.489 --> 01:12:36.149
What does he mean by that?

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.387
Richard, why didn't you stop he?

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:42.317
What was I supposed to do?
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

01:12:52.594 --> 01:12:54.561
Okay, seriously though, what the hell?

01:12:59.688 --> 01:13:01.398
Hey, can we take an extra bowl?

01:13:01.398 --> 01:13:02.786
Sure.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.405
You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten anything today?

01:13:12.405 --> 01:13:13.706
Eat.

01:13:17.711 --> 01:13:19.028
This is a nightmare.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.729
So why?

01:13:24.068 --> 01:13:26.016
- Why?
- Why?

01:13:27.281 --> 01:13:30.317
Hey, this is everything.

01:13:31.439 --> 01:13:33.400
There gotta be a bigger reason why
and you know it.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.967
Well, how about it had to do more
with you guys than with me.

01:13:38.065 --> 01:13:39.400
Yeah.

01:13:40.151 --> 01:13:42.091
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:49.018
Did he tell you anything?

01:13:49.018 --> 01:13:50.754
Only that I wasn't getting a cent.

01:13:50.754 --> 01:13:52.852
That's because he wanted you to build
something from the ground...

01:13:52.852 --> 01:13:54.527
"Build something
from the ground up", yeah.

01:13:54.527 --> 01:13:56.161
My mother built her business
from the ground up

01:13:56.161 --> 01:13:58.739
with a million dollar loan
from my grandfather.

01:13:58.885 --> 01:14:01.823
My father owns none of it,
she made him sign a prenup.

01:14:01.867 --> 01:14:03.115
He lives in fear.

01:14:03.621 --> 01:14:06.776
And I know that's what grandfather was
trying to protect me from by doing this,

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:10.423
And I know I shouldn't say this
out loud, but when he told me, I...

01:14:12.172 --> 01:14:14.805
Jesus, I coulda killed him.

01:14:17.398 --> 01:14:20.027
After I left the party, though,
I was driving

01:14:20.572 --> 01:14:23.798
nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this...

01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:27.461
clarity.

01:14:27.945 --> 01:14:31.060
Like from here on out
I was gonna have to fend for myself.

01:14:31.861 --> 01:14:33.481
And that felt...

01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:35.838
Good.

01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:38.708
The old bastard.

01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:47.518
Marta I know three things.
One: I know he didn't commit suicide.

01:14:49.648 --> 01:14:50.622
What makes you think that?

01:14:50.622 --> 01:14:53.132
I don't think it. I know it.

01:14:53.806 --> 01:14:55.433
Because I knew my granddad.

01:14:55.433 --> 01:14:57.300
Maybe you and I
are the only two who knew him,

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.969
so you're not gonna bullshit
me on this, because two:

01:15:00.968 --> 01:15:02.918
I know lying makes you puke.

01:15:03.403 --> 01:15:05.952
'Cause of that mafia game
last 4th of July.

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:08.753
And three:

01:15:10.376 --> 01:15:13.533
I know that you just ate a full plate
of baked beans and sausage.

01:15:16.184 --> 01:15:17.615
So.

01:15:19.244 --> 01:15:21.255
Look me in the eye

01:15:21.937 --> 01:15:24.576
and tell me what
happened to my grandfather.

01:15:27.506 --> 01:15:29.412
- You asshole.
- Marta.

01:15:30.418 --> 01:15:32.762
Tell me everything.

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:37.790
Alan, there have got
to be options here.

01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:40.232
No. I don't know how many times

01:15:40.232 --> 01:15:43.524
I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.

01:15:43.524 --> 01:15:46.918
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:48.512
and we've all confirmed he was.

01:15:48.512 --> 01:15:51.220
Would a sound mind
do this! How? Sound how?

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:53.683
The very action
speaks to unsoundness!

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.244
Not legally, no.

01:15:55.882 --> 01:15:59.715
You, not liking what he did
does not speak to testamentary capacity.

01:15:59.715 --> 01:16:02.414
What about undue influence?

01:16:02.414 --> 01:16:04.789
Yes! Undue influence!
How about that?

01:16:05.308 --> 01:16:06.277
Did you just Google that?

01:16:06.277 --> 01:16:09.311
Look, if Marta was manipulating
dad somehow, and if...

01:16:09.311 --> 01:16:11.798
If somehow she had gotten
her hooks into him.

01:16:11.798 --> 01:16:14.196
You need a strong case for that.

01:16:14.639 --> 01:16:17.070
Your honor, "She endeared herself to him"

01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:19.319
through hard work and good humor."

01:16:19.485 --> 01:16:21.584
That won't cut the salami.

01:16:21.724 --> 01:16:23.367
What about the slayer rule?

01:16:24.153 --> 01:16:25.498
I did just Google that.

01:16:25.869 --> 01:16:27.788
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

01:16:28.992 --> 01:16:30.563
What the hell is the slayer rule?

01:16:30.563 --> 01:16:34.701
It's if someone is convicted of killing the
person, they don't get their inheritance.

01:16:34.701 --> 01:16:38.616
Not even convicted, even if they're held
responsible for their death in civil court.

01:16:39.118 --> 01:16:40.592
Like OJ.

01:16:40.907 --> 01:16:46.520
Yes, Like OJ.
But Harlan committed suicide.

01:16:55.103 --> 01:16:56.830
Detective Blank.

01:16:56.830 --> 01:17:00.053
You said that the investigation is ongoing,
you made a point of that.

01:17:00.351 --> 01:17:01.829
Do you suspect foul play?

01:17:01.829 --> 01:17:04.956
Mister Blanc. If you please.

01:17:06.329 --> 01:17:12.886
There is much that remains unclear.
But yes. I suspect foul play.

01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:15.665
Marta?

01:17:15.863 --> 01:17:18.339
I have eliminated no suspects.

01:17:20.417 --> 01:17:23.705
You're full of shit, I don't trust
this guy in the tweed suit,

01:17:24.008 --> 01:17:26.394
and Alan, God bless you,
you're useless.

01:17:26.935 --> 01:17:28.064
Thank you.

01:17:28.064 --> 01:17:31.195
There's only one answer to this:
she has to renounce the inheritance.

01:17:31.195 --> 01:17:32.171
She knows that's what
she should do...

01:17:32.171 --> 01:17:34.194
That's exactly what she'll do.

01:17:36.424 --> 01:17:37.801
- Mom.
- She'll do it.

01:17:38.173 --> 01:17:41.057
If Granddad wanted to give Marta
everything, then that's what he wanted.

01:17:41.057 --> 01:17:44.510
No, this wasn't him.
He loved us.

01:17:44.654 --> 01:17:48.269
He wanted us taken care of.
He wanted you to have an education.

01:17:48.749 --> 01:17:52.385
Meg, you think I can pay
for your school?

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:06.647
I know, just saying it it
sounds insane, but it's all true.

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:09.287
And I think Blanc's been on to me
from the start.

01:18:09.447 --> 01:18:11.853
I don't care if I go to jail,
but my mom...

01:18:12.391 --> 01:18:14.949
My sister, we...

01:18:17.513 --> 01:18:19.342
Are you gonna say something?

01:18:20.587 --> 01:18:23.740
I always thought I was the only one
that could beat him at GO.

01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:26.631
I always thought
that meant something.

01:18:26.981 --> 01:18:28.943
Yeah, I know you did.

01:18:28.943 --> 01:18:33.483
In the night of the party, my last
conversation with him, our last argument.

01:18:33.483 --> 01:18:35.359
That's what he told me about you.

01:18:36.405 --> 01:18:38.910
That you beat him in GO
more than I do, and I thought...

01:18:41.404 --> 01:18:43.585
What a strange thing to tell me.

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.337
I think I get it now.

01:18:49.461 --> 01:18:51.505
It did mean something.

01:18:56.946 --> 01:18:58.788
I'm not gonna tell my family shit.

01:18:58.936 --> 01:19:01.967
You're not going to jail.
That detective is not gonna catch you.

01:19:03.073 --> 01:19:05.194
And you're not gonna
give up the money.

01:19:05.434 --> 01:19:08.593
This is was granddad wanted for you and me, think
about what he did to go through with this.

01:19:08.593 --> 01:19:11.259
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

01:19:12.266 --> 01:19:13.970
And he wanted it for you.

01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:18.211
You've come this far.
Let me help you go all the way.

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:20.159
What's going on? This isn't you.

01:19:20.713 --> 01:19:25.066
You could just turn me in right now and
still get your cut of the inheritance. Why?

01:19:25.615 --> 01:19:27.555
Because fuck my family.

01:19:28.915 --> 01:19:31.742
I can help you get away
with this, and then...

01:19:32.722 --> 01:19:35.237
You're gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance.

01:19:36.711 --> 01:19:40.737
Happy ending. Everybody wins:
you, me, Harlan.

01:19:40.737 --> 01:19:42.393
Yeah.

01:19:43.118 --> 01:19:45.314
Deal?

01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:58.224
- Meg.
- Marta.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.923
- That was nuts.
- I know.

01:20:02.311 --> 01:20:03.538
Are you okay?

01:20:05.035 --> 01:20:07.141
Yeah. Are you?

01:20:07.141 --> 01:20:08.545
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:20:10.184 --> 01:20:12.227
Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just...

01:20:12.424 --> 01:20:13.868
I wanted to...

01:20:16.388 --> 01:20:19.134
I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.

01:20:20.444 --> 01:20:25.944
And... I guess I wanted to ask...
What are you gonna do?

01:20:28.846 --> 01:20:30.368
What do you mean?

01:20:30.368 --> 01:20:33.934
Well, the... with the will.
What are you gonna to do?

01:20:36.621 --> 01:20:38.526
What do you think I should do?

01:20:39.095 --> 01:20:43.710
You should do
whatever you think is right.

01:20:46.372 --> 01:20:48.127
Look, I...

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:52.114
I think you should
give it back to us.

01:20:53.909 --> 01:20:57.150
Granddad always took
care of us, we're his family.

01:20:57.935 --> 01:21:01.538
I know he was like family to you,
but we're his actual family.

01:21:01.684 --> 01:21:02.769
Yeah.

01:21:03.778 --> 01:21:08.581
Marta, you know this isn't fair,
we've always been good to you,

01:21:08.581 --> 01:21:11.435
and you're like family
and we'll take care of you, but...

01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:15.934
You have to make things right.
You know what's right.

01:21:16.787 --> 01:21:18.140
Marta.

01:21:20.674 --> 01:21:24.668
Mom's broke, she says
I'm gonna have to drop out of school.

01:21:24.668 --> 01:21:26.353
No, no, Meg.

01:21:27.961 --> 01:21:29.750
Listen, I won't let that happen.

01:21:29.922 --> 01:21:33.352
Whatever money you need,
I'll give it to you. I'm here for you.

01:21:33.352 --> 01:21:35.177
And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:21:35.177 --> 01:21:38.835
- I promise that, okay?
- Thanks.

01:21:39.387 --> 01:21:40.948
And once I...

01:21:59.965 --> 01:22:01.512
Okay then.

01:22:02.005 --> 01:22:04.718
Did Blanc find anything
suspicious at the house?

01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:11.474
Yes, he found mud, upstairs,
where I broke in through the window.

01:22:12.209 --> 01:22:13.800
Identifiable prints?

01:22:14.187 --> 01:22:16.748
- No.
- Good, okay.

01:22:17.519 --> 01:22:19.358
Good. Hey.

01:22:19.358 --> 01:22:23.533
You lay low for a coupe of days. Wait for
this investigation to blow over, and it will.

01:22:23.533 --> 01:22:27.406
'Cause no matter how good that Blanc guy
thinks he is, he's got nothing.

01:22:27.578 --> 01:22:30.081
Hey, Relax.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.564
Marta get your ass up, what the hell is happening?
There's a guy here and a bunch of stuff.

01:22:35.564 --> 01:22:37.691
Everything's going crazy.
Are we rich?

01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:40.960
Maybe, Alice, I don't know.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.850
I don't even know what that means
but you better get your ass up.

01:22:44.633 --> 01:22:48.170
We don't know much about Marta Cabrera
or her exact relationship...

01:22:48.170 --> 01:22:51.682
Oh my God Marta.
What is all this. What did you do?

01:22:52.444 --> 01:22:54.696
- Is that here?
- Oh, yeah it is.

01:22:55.841 --> 01:22:58.792
Wait, so is that true?
Are we rich?

01:23:02.009 --> 01:23:03.391
Oh my God.

01:23:17.491 --> 01:23:19.811
Good Morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

01:23:24.934 --> 01:23:28.051
Why is grief the providence of youth?

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:30.977
I don't know.

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:37.415
But I'd imagine that
age deepens all feelings.

01:23:38.821 --> 01:23:40.949
Including grief.

01:23:43.256 --> 01:23:50.334
This was a long walk to offering
condolences for the loss of your son.

01:23:51.442 --> 01:23:57.353
And asking you if it isn't presumptuous of
me not to think too harshly of your family.

01:23:58.464 --> 01:24:03.188
If I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.

01:24:04.445 --> 01:24:07.327
They're young, aren't they?

01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:17.775
One thing I assume of age
is weariness.

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:21.155
Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:26.655
Tired of what I do.
Following arcs, like lobbed rocks.

01:24:26.832 --> 01:24:29.381
The inevitability of truth.

01:24:32.263 --> 01:24:37.330
But the complexity
and the gray lie not in the truth

01:24:38.576 --> 01:24:42.349
but what you do
with the truth once you have it.

01:24:49.261 --> 01:24:52.940
I think you have something
you wanna tell me.

01:24:54.015 --> 01:24:58.049
I think you're very perceptive
and very capable

01:24:58.049 --> 01:25:02.460
of telling me what you saw
the night of your son's party.

01:25:10.683 --> 01:25:14.844
But I'll happily wait.
I'm in no rush.

01:25:15.995 --> 01:25:20.958
In fact, I find it quite pleasant,
sitting here with you.

01:25:29.101 --> 01:25:31.553
Lawyers were here,
very big lawyers it looked like.

01:25:31.553 --> 01:25:34.064
They left all this stuff
and business cards,

01:25:34.064 --> 01:25:36.245
and there was a pile
of other stuff when I got home.

01:25:37.392 --> 01:25:39.539
I don't like any of this, Marta.

01:25:39.675 --> 01:25:41.347
I don't like it either.

01:25:41.535 --> 01:25:44.265
I'm slipping out the back.
I'll be back later.

01:25:44.265 --> 01:25:46.180
Please don't talk to anyone.

01:25:52.673 --> 01:25:54.014
Walt?

01:25:54.517 --> 01:25:58.654
Yeah, I came from...
Hey, how are you doing?

01:26:01.429 --> 01:26:04.028
Walt, I want you to know
that I didn't know about any of this.

01:26:04.028 --> 01:26:06.707
We know you didn't.
We know you didn't.

01:26:07.005 --> 01:26:10.047
Yeah, we all kinda went
a little crazy yesterday.

01:26:10.047 --> 01:26:12.032
- Understandable.
- Yeah.

01:26:13.428 --> 01:26:15.197
I haven't even looked
at all this yet.

01:26:15.197 --> 01:26:20.324
It must just be local lawyers and accountants
who saw the news and wanna get a jump on it.

01:26:21.078 --> 01:26:23.380
I'd be careful of all of it.

01:26:25.022 --> 01:26:29.294
Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?

01:26:32.410 --> 01:26:34.864
This is what Harlan wanted.

01:26:36.739 --> 01:26:41.102
Yeah, but, Harlan put you
in a very hard position here.

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:43.855
It was unfair of him.

01:26:44.803 --> 01:26:48.829
You see the kind of
press and the scrutiny that this kicks up?

01:26:49.421 --> 01:26:52.050
We know... with your mother.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.164
- My mother?
- Yeah.

01:27:00.625 --> 01:27:02.318
What did Meg tell you?

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:04.903
This isn't about Meg.

01:27:06.598 --> 01:27:09.750
You're missing the point.
We don't wanna attack you with this.

01:27:10.298 --> 01:27:15.003
Marta, if your mother came into
the country illegally, criminally,

01:27:15.133 --> 01:27:19.089
and you come into this inheritance
with all the scrutiny that entails,

01:27:19.089 --> 01:27:23.456
I'd be afraid that could come to light.
That's what we wanna avoid here.

01:27:23.456 --> 01:27:28.431
We can protect you from
that happening, or if it happens.

01:27:28.753 --> 01:27:32.616
So, you're saying that
even if it came to light.

01:27:33.693 --> 01:27:36.039
With your family's resources
you could help me fix it.

01:27:36.039 --> 01:27:40.946
Yeah, with the right lawyers,
you know, not these local guys,

01:27:40.946 --> 01:27:43.618
but New York lawyers,
DC lawyers.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.881
With enough resources
put toward it, yes.

01:27:45.881 --> 01:27:50.534
Not that that ever even needs
to come up. But yes.

01:27:52.369 --> 01:27:53.923
Okay. Good.

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.779
Okay?

01:27:57.814 --> 01:28:01.097
'Cause Harlan gave
me all your resources.

01:28:01.668 --> 01:28:04.517
So, that means with my resources
I'll be able to fix it.

01:28:04.517 --> 01:28:06.872
So, I guess I will find
the right lawyers.

01:28:07.401 --> 01:28:08.901
Marta, that's...

01:28:10.791 --> 01:28:12.852
Better be sure if that's

01:28:13.825 --> 01:28:15.673
what you want.

01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:54.974
I don't know. What's this?

01:28:54.974 --> 01:28:59.116
It's my medical bag tag.
They have my medical bag, for some reason.

01:28:59.357 --> 01:29:04.279
Okay, but this is a photocopy of just the
header of a blood toxicology report on Harlan.

01:29:04.459 --> 01:29:06.660
Marta, this is gonna show
the morphine overdose.

01:29:10.337 --> 01:29:12.099
So I'm screwed!

01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:14.895
How do you know all this stuff?

01:29:14.895 --> 01:29:17.390
I was Harlan's
research assistant for a summer.

01:29:18.443 --> 01:29:20.638
But what kind of blackmail
scheme is this?

01:29:20.724 --> 01:29:23.951
I mean the actual evidence
is sitting up the street at the crime lab.

01:29:23.951 --> 01:29:26.528
There are no demands,
there's no meeting place.

01:29:28.711 --> 01:29:30.717
What's the point
of sending you this?

01:29:40.857 --> 01:29:42.979
Could be a half hour.
Could be an hour.

01:29:42.979 --> 01:29:44.631
We wanna make sure...

01:29:53.468 --> 01:29:55.556
- What's the cheese?
- Hey.

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:57.020
- Thank you.
- No problem.

01:29:57.694 --> 01:30:00.673
5 AM, security systems
here were all triggered.

01:30:00.912 --> 01:30:02.325
This thing went up really quick.

01:30:02.325 --> 01:30:06.595
So that means blood stores, records,
anything of that nature, it's all gone.

01:30:06.775 --> 01:30:09.880
There were no employees here,
so thank God for that.

01:30:10.919 --> 01:30:13.976
- What about security cameras?
- Oh yeah.

01:30:16.653 --> 01:30:19.776
Speaking of security, the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate

01:30:19.776 --> 01:30:22.143
was all scrambled for some reason.

01:30:24.399 --> 01:30:26.562
What's still pending
from the autopsy?

01:30:27.043 --> 01:30:28.867
Just the report on the blood work.

01:30:30.213 --> 01:30:31.939
Blood work?

01:30:36.268 --> 01:30:38.350
Holy shit!

01:30:41.296 --> 01:30:43.254
This is insane!

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:48.071
I mean who would blow up the whole
real building just to blackmail me?

01:30:48.071 --> 01:30:50.489
Marta this means that the blackmailer
has the only paper copy

01:30:50.489 --> 01:30:52.165
of the thing
that can prove your guilt.

01:30:52.165 --> 01:30:55.448
You didn't get any other instructions,
no phone call, no email, nothing?

01:30:57.605 --> 01:30:59.373
I haven't checked my email.

01:31:04.869 --> 01:31:06.383
There is one.

01:31:06.383 --> 01:31:10.375
That's it. 1209 Columbus Road, 10 AM.

01:31:15.871 --> 01:31:17.091
You know what this means, right?

01:31:17.091 --> 01:31:21.090
If you destroy that copy
you are totally in the clear.

01:31:21.095 --> 01:31:22.547
Oh no!

01:31:23.761 --> 01:31:26.511
Marta, did you hear me?

01:31:27.621 --> 01:31:29.134
Yeah.

01:31:36.966 --> 01:31:39.471
Elliott!
We gotta go! We gotta go!

01:31:42.568 --> 01:31:43.498
Okay, Baby Driver.

01:31:43.506 --> 01:31:45.921
Oh God! You regret helping me yet?

01:31:45.921 --> 01:31:48.170
I regret not taking the beamer.

01:31:49.906 --> 01:31:51.722
Oh shit!

01:32:04.842 --> 01:32:06.647
Vehicles in pursuit in
Washington Street.

01:32:06.647 --> 01:32:08.280
- Make sure you say "No force."
- No force.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:11.171
- We got a possible murder suspect.
- I said that, I said that.

01:32:12.734 --> 01:32:14.823
Go! Go!
Are you flooring it?

01:32:14.823 --> 01:32:16.902
I am literally flooring it.

01:32:27.569 --> 01:32:29.289
- This is going well.
- I'm pulling over.

01:32:29.289 --> 01:32:32.575
If you miss your chance
to get this tox report it's all over.

01:32:32.575 --> 01:32:34.081
Oh my God!

01:32:38.888 --> 01:32:40.058
Why are we stopping?

01:32:40.058 --> 01:32:42.576
Why are you stopping
in the middle of the road?

01:32:55.696 --> 01:32:57.020
Hold on!

01:33:20.721 --> 01:33:24.759
Oh my God. I'm just pure adrenaline
right now, I feel like I swallowed bees.

01:33:25.078 --> 01:33:27.322
Okay, so, what is it?
What's the address?

01:33:27.322 --> 01:33:29.256
- 1209 Columbus road.
- Okay.

01:33:29.744 --> 01:33:31.899
I mean, whatever they want,
I'll say yes because...

01:33:32.075 --> 01:33:33.564
You know, just to get
that report back.

01:33:33.564 --> 01:33:35.604
- Get it back and destroy it.
- Destroy it.

01:33:36.094 --> 01:33:37.898
Holy shit! Ransom.

01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:42.338
Thank you. I couldn't
do this without you.

01:33:46.153 --> 01:33:47.572
Oh my God!

01:33:48.769 --> 01:33:50.309
Get out!

01:33:51.552 --> 01:33:54.628
That was the dumbest
car chase of all time.

01:33:54.628 --> 01:33:55.805
Put your hands down.

01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:58.468
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,
Greatnana.

01:33:58.976 --> 01:34:02.557
The night of the party she saw someone
climbing the trellis to the third floor.

01:34:03.128 --> 01:34:05.340
Mr. Drysdale, come on.

01:34:06.048 --> 01:34:07.648
Pat him down, check him out.

01:34:07.648 --> 01:34:09.388
What's going on?

01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.395
"Ransom came back" she said.

01:34:12.335 --> 01:34:15.090
I don't know what he came back to do,
but we'll find out.

01:34:15.183 --> 01:34:16.382
You have anything sharp?

01:34:17.419 --> 01:34:20.086
- Watch your head. Thank you.
- You don't need to thank him.

01:34:20.086 --> 01:34:23.769
Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?

01:34:25.083 --> 01:34:26.629
Yes.

01:34:33.916 --> 01:34:35.327
Blanc, you're coming with us?

01:34:35.327 --> 01:34:36.795
I'll drive with Marta.

01:34:37.522 --> 01:34:39.362
Let's go to the police station.

01:34:39.362 --> 01:34:42.474
I wanna full run down
on everything he said to you.

01:34:42.662 --> 01:34:44.747
And I'll can catch you up
on where we're at.

01:34:51.612 --> 01:34:54.263
Strange case from the start.

01:34:55.501 --> 01:34:58.518
A case with a hole in the middle.

01:35:00.451 --> 01:35:01.982
A donut?

01:35:02.883 --> 01:35:06.849
I'm just talking through my process here,
let me know if this is boring.

01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.380
I feel the noose tightening,
the family is truly desperate.

01:35:13.090 --> 01:35:14.765
Desperate motives.

01:35:15.339 --> 01:35:21.698
Then mystery of who hired me,
the impossibility of the crime, and yet...

01:35:22.788 --> 01:35:30.391
A donut! One central piece, and if
it reveals itself the fog would lift,

01:35:30.862 --> 01:35:34.375
the arc would resolve,
the slinky become unkinked.

01:35:34.375 --> 01:35:36.468
Do you mind
if I stop for a second?

01:35:36.639 --> 01:35:39.725
I need to pick something up.
It will be very quick.

01:35:41.057 --> 01:35:42.421
Sure.

01:35:55.632 --> 01:35:56.905
It'll be just a few minutes.

01:35:56.905 --> 01:35:59.670
I'll watch the door.

01:36:22.697 --> 01:36:24.661
Hello?

01:36:47.374 --> 01:36:49.171
Listen, I don't know what you want.

01:36:52.190 --> 01:36:54.005
Whatever it is we can work it out.

01:36:54.005 --> 01:36:56.492
But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.

01:36:56.770 --> 01:36:58.508
And I'm leaving with that report.

01:37:03.057 --> 01:37:04.722
Hello?

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.446
Fran?

01:37:40.670 --> 01:37:42.778
No, no, no! Fran.

01:37:45.675 --> 01:37:49.155
Can you hear me?
Fran, give me a sign if you can hear me.

01:37:49.155 --> 01:37:50.114
You.

01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:51.801
Yes, it's me, it's Marta.

01:37:51.801 --> 01:37:54.409
You called me here, you sent
me an email, that's why I'm here.

01:37:54.409 --> 01:37:55.602
Did you take something?

01:37:55.602 --> 01:37:58.220
I'm gonna call an ambulance now
and you're going to be okay.

01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.168
You gonna be fine, okay?
Stay with me.

01:38:00.538 --> 01:38:01.491
What?

01:38:01.491 --> 01:38:02.812
Help me.

01:38:03.539 --> 01:38:04.793
- Stashed.
- What?

01:38:04.793 --> 01:38:06.633
What are you saying?

01:38:07.209 --> 01:38:09.401
You did this!

01:38:09.401 --> 01:38:11.492
You won't get away with this!

01:38:11.492 --> 01:38:13.588
Jesus! Stop!

01:38:35.151 --> 01:38:37.443

Oh lord.

All right my friend,
thank you for the update.

01:39:04.291 --> 01:39:08.767
No need for that, I'll bring her in once
we get word that the housekeeper is stable.

01:39:08.767 --> 01:39:11.833
It's still touch and go. All right.

01:39:13.377 --> 01:39:16.191
This is over.
People are getting hurt.

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.642
So, I'm gonna tell you
the truth.

01:39:19.642 --> 01:39:23.816
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

01:39:24.023 --> 01:39:27.166
Good. Wait, I hope
he didn't cover for me.

01:39:27.166 --> 01:39:29.793
Did he tell the real truth
about me switching the...

01:39:29.793 --> 01:39:30.625
Yeah.

01:39:30.625 --> 01:39:32.723
- And the disguise...
- Yes.

01:39:32.723 --> 01:39:34.433
And the whole blackmailing...

01:39:35.242 --> 01:39:37.399
But why did Fran take my morphine?

01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:39.826
Obviously, she had swiped
a bag from the house,

01:39:39.826 --> 01:39:43.970
but she didn't seem like a user to me, unless
that's why she needed the blackmail money...

01:39:44.249 --> 01:39:46.262
I don't know,
it doesn't matter anyway.

01:39:46.627 --> 01:39:49.601
I have to tell the Thrombeys myself,
I feel like I owe that to them.

01:39:49.601 --> 01:39:50.770
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:39:50.770 --> 01:39:52.945
No, I have to do it!
I need to do it!

01:39:55.212 --> 01:39:58.383
I gave the doctors my number, so they'll
call if anything changes with Fran.

01:39:58.383 --> 01:39:59.508
All right.

01:39:59.508 --> 01:40:02.778
We'll round up the Thrombeys
at the house, along with a police escort.

01:40:03.347 --> 01:40:05.542
For the arrest after.

01:40:05.736 --> 01:40:08.761
You can tell me your whole
story on the drive over.

01:40:09.293 --> 01:40:11.610
I don't want any more surprises.

01:40:27.026 --> 01:40:29.311
Fran said it was stashed, the copy,

01:40:29.477 --> 01:40:33.443
and then she said,
"you did this, you won't get away with it."

01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:37.961
I called the ambulance. That's it.

01:40:39.112 --> 01:40:40.483
All right.

01:40:42.239 --> 01:40:44.088
You ready?

01:40:50.751 --> 01:40:54.005
Okay, has she come
to her senses?

01:40:54.228 --> 01:40:56.463
She's standing right there Richard,
she can speak for herself.

01:40:56.463 --> 01:40:58.041
Is the rest of the family here?

01:40:58.041 --> 01:40:59.943
- In the living room.
- I think it would be better if we were

01:40:59.943 --> 01:41:02.549
to gather together
and get this over with.

01:41:08.056 --> 01:41:09.891
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:13.574
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I told them
about your mom.

01:41:13.574 --> 01:41:15.454
Meg, it's okay.

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:18.864
I'm sorry. No, I was scared, I just,
I didn't wanna tell them...

01:41:18.864 --> 01:41:21.595
I get it. Trust me.

01:41:22.689 --> 01:41:24.945
I understand. It's all right.

01:41:25.943 --> 01:41:27.645
I'm sorry.

01:41:30.049 --> 01:41:32.721
God, I'm so raiding Fran's
stash after this.

01:41:32.913 --> 01:41:38.184
I still think this is a bad idea,
but the family is assembled.

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:43.925
I know where the tox report is.

01:41:50.862 --> 01:41:52.751
She basically told me where it was.

01:41:55.249 --> 01:41:57.418
Anyway this will tie everything up.

01:41:59.293 --> 01:42:01.376
And I just handed it to you.

01:42:02.378 --> 01:42:05.130
God, you're not much
of a detective, are you?

01:42:05.912 --> 01:42:07.418
To be fair.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.889
You make a pretty lousy murderer.

01:42:13.302 --> 01:42:15.731
Perhaps we deserve each other.

01:42:27.168 --> 01:42:29.693
You've always been good to me.

01:42:31.164 --> 01:42:34.853
What I'm about to say isn't gonna be easy
and you're gonna be upset.

01:42:35.487 --> 01:42:38.898
But I thought after what
you've gone through the last few days,

01:42:39.644 --> 01:42:42.666
that you deserved
to hear it from me.

01:42:44.884 --> 01:42:45.344
I...

01:42:45.344 --> 01:42:46.782
Excuse me!

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.180
You have not been
good to her.

01:42:53.726 --> 01:42:57.717
You have all treated her like shit
to steal back a fortune

01:42:57.717 --> 01:42:59.931
that you lost and she deserves.

01:43:00.091 --> 01:43:03.116
You're a pack of vultures
at the feast.

01:43:03.116 --> 01:43:05.316
Nose all beak's bloody.

01:43:05.316 --> 01:43:09.862
Well, you're not getting
bailed out, not this time.

01:43:10.622 --> 01:43:15.243
Ms. Cabrera has decided definitively
not to renounce the inheritance.

01:43:15.243 --> 01:43:16.140
What?

01:43:16.496 --> 01:43:17.075
What?

01:43:17.075 --> 01:43:21.318
Furthermore, it will be my professional
recommendation to the local authorities

01:43:21.318 --> 01:43:23.923
that the manner of death
in the case of Harlan Thrombey

01:43:23.923 --> 01:43:27.952
is ruled as suicide,
and the case is closed.

01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:28.969
- Blanc.
- What?

01:43:28.969 --> 01:43:30.707
Thank you all for coming.
Goodbye.

01:43:30.707 --> 01:43:31.946
What's going on?

01:43:31.946 --> 01:43:33.297
Just tell me what's...

01:43:34.581 --> 01:43:37.265
That's certainly not
what I was expecting.

01:43:38.201 --> 01:43:39.320
Is anybody else confused?

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.654
Not what I was
expecting to hear at all.

01:43:44.494 --> 01:43:45.998
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:43:45.998 --> 01:43:46.881
Yes.

01:43:46.881 --> 01:43:49.037
I just wanna come clean, okay?

01:43:49.037 --> 01:43:50.307
- It's over.
- Almost.

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:51.641
Blanc, what are we doing?

01:43:51.641 --> 01:43:53.955
I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

01:43:54.412 --> 01:43:57.362
Keep the family out of this room,
get them out of the house if you can.

01:43:57.362 --> 01:43:59.619
But stand by
with your additional officer.

01:43:59.619 --> 01:44:01.843
- Get the family out?
- Yes, but not all of them.

01:44:03.433 --> 01:44:04.091
Blanc.

01:44:04.091 --> 01:44:05.224
- Yes, sir.
- Come on. Come on.

01:44:05.224 --> 01:44:06.273
What's with all this drama?

01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:07.333
Indulge me.

01:44:07.333 --> 01:44:11.111
Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom told
you, I'm telling you now -

01:44:11.730 --> 01:44:14.463
it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.

01:44:14.463 --> 01:44:17.728
Yes, you did. Yes, he did.
Yes, you are, but. But.

01:44:18.292 --> 01:44:22.147
I spoke in the car about the hole
at the center of this donut.

01:44:22.665 --> 01:44:26.509
And what you and Harlan did that fateful
night seems at first glance

01:44:26.509 --> 01:44:28.377
to fill that hole perfectly.

01:44:28.532 --> 01:44:31.098
A donut hole in a donut's hole.

01:44:31.942 --> 01:44:33.980
But we must look a little closer.

01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:39.736
And when we do, we see that
the donut hole has a hole in its center.

01:44:39.909 --> 01:44:44.921
It is not a donut hole, but a smaller
donut with its own hole,

01:44:45.074 --> 01:44:47.929
and our donut is not holed at all!

01:44:47.929 --> 01:44:50.220
Blanc, look, I understand that
this is amusing for you.

01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:54.843
Why was I hired?
Why would someone hire me?

01:44:54.843 --> 01:44:57.416
Someone fishing for a crime
to reverse the will, Blanc.

01:44:57.416 --> 01:44:59.887
I was hired before
the sealed will was read.

01:45:00.273 --> 01:45:04.217
So yes, the person must have
known the contents of the will.

01:45:04.832 --> 01:45:09.182
But one step further - that same person
must have known a crime was committed,

01:45:09.182 --> 01:45:10.449
and further,

01:45:10.987 --> 01:45:15.036
if the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

01:45:15.944 --> 01:45:18.557
they must've known
that Marta was responsible.

01:45:19.261 --> 01:45:23.277
An intriguing combination of factors.
Someone who knew what Marta did,

01:45:23.277 --> 01:45:26.724
wanted to expose it,
but could not reveal how they knew.

01:45:26.886 --> 01:45:30.943
Fran! She was blackmailing me,
she knew what I did.

01:45:31.093 --> 01:45:35.055
But Fran wanted money,
ergo she did not want the crime exposed.

01:45:35.055 --> 01:45:37.881
Did someone in the family observe Marta
doing something suspicious?

01:45:37.881 --> 01:45:41.031
But they would've had no reason
not to speak up.

01:45:43.108 --> 01:45:46.005
The answer is not so simple.

01:45:46.874 --> 01:45:51.136
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view.

01:45:51.136 --> 01:45:54.355
The arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

01:45:56.744 --> 01:45:59.167
And Marta, it will not be easy
for you to hear.

01:45:59.773 --> 01:46:05.494
But there is at least one
truly guilty party behind it all,

01:46:05.494 --> 01:46:08.577
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice,

01:46:09.084 --> 01:46:12.007
committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

01:46:14.979 --> 01:46:16.535
Trooper Wagner.

01:46:16.535 --> 01:46:18.124
Trooper Wagner?

01:46:19.335 --> 01:46:20.722
No.

01:46:22.248 --> 01:46:26.070
Marta, I'm so sorry. I told them
everything, I figured it was up. I'm sorry.

01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:28.360
It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:30.594
Not exactly everything though.

01:46:30.995 --> 01:46:32.992
Is this about what
Greatnana told you?

01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:36.415
She saw me that night,
she mistook me for Ransom.

01:46:36.415 --> 01:46:38.907
We'll get to that.
In the meanwhile,

01:46:39.386 --> 01:46:41.804
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

01:46:42.141 --> 01:46:46.207
you might tell us all
why you hired me?

01:46:49.422 --> 01:46:51.034
Why I hired you?

01:46:51.536 --> 01:46:55.149
You're right, let's back up.
To the night of the party.

01:46:55.259 --> 01:46:57.358
Your argument with Harlan.

01:46:57.808 --> 01:47:02.180
What were the overheard words by the
Nazi child, masturbating in the bathroom?

01:47:02.406 --> 01:47:05.529
"My will" and
"I'm warning you."

01:47:06.059 --> 01:47:11.727
You and Harlan were "drama mamas," you shared a
love of twisting the knife into one another.

01:47:11.749 --> 01:47:15.667
You see, I don't believe he would've
slipped it in halfway - no, no, no.

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:20.674
I submit Harlan told you everything.

01:47:20.796 --> 01:47:22.156
You can't be serious!

01:47:22.156 --> 01:47:28.199
Not a red dime or word of my work
to a single one of them, you included.

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:34.201
Marta, remind me what Ransom said
his conversation with Harlan ended with.

01:47:34.747 --> 01:47:37.233
Harlan told him that I could beat
him at GO.

01:47:37.233 --> 01:47:40.161
And I asked myself - Marta?

01:47:40.528 --> 01:47:44.582
How would the topic of the will
have steered around to Marta?

01:47:46.022 --> 01:47:49.248
There is one obvious explanation.

01:47:49.359 --> 01:47:52.247
You can't be that crazy, you're not
just gonna throw away your fortune.

01:47:52.247 --> 01:47:55.519
No. I'm giving it to Marta.
All of it.

01:47:56.816 --> 01:47:59.518
Your Brazilian nurse?
Are you goddamn insane?

01:47:59.518 --> 01:48:03.785
I am sane for the first time
in my life and I've done it.

01:48:04.494 --> 01:48:07.437
I've made the change
to my will, it's done.

01:48:07.735 --> 01:48:09.018
I'm warning you!

01:48:09.956 --> 01:48:12.193
That's some heavy duty conjecture.

01:48:12.243 --> 01:48:13.679
Granted.

01:48:13.881 --> 01:48:17.349
But it is the only way of
what comes next makes sense.

01:48:17.742 --> 01:48:21.303
So, you storm out,
you drive off into the night.

01:48:22.062 --> 01:48:26.370
You tell Marta later of, what was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

01:48:26.551 --> 01:48:31.056
Clarity. That he has to make do
for himself from here on out.

01:48:31.381 --> 01:48:32.940
Exactly!

01:48:35.579 --> 01:48:40.001
Marta. The will. Harlan.
Do for yourself.

01:48:40.001 --> 01:48:42.260
"You won't get away with this."

01:48:42.762 --> 01:48:44.793
And a plan forms.

01:48:53.251 --> 01:48:57.691
You return, careful to avoid the
gate's security camera range.

01:48:57.841 --> 01:49:00.106
Then on foot up towards the house.

01:49:00.245 --> 01:49:04.554
You sneak in, up the trellis so as
not to be seen by the rest of the family,

01:49:04.554 --> 01:49:07.231
who are still having their
party downstairs.

01:49:09.156 --> 01:49:12.523
What you need to do
will take moments.

01:49:13.098 --> 01:49:17.204
But it is essential that
you are alone and undetected.

01:49:17.512 --> 01:49:19.968
You knew what medications Harlan took.

01:49:19.968 --> 01:49:22.740
You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.

01:49:24.058 --> 01:49:31.403
And you knew if Marta was responsible
for his death, even unintentionally,

01:49:32.228 --> 01:49:37.824
the slayer rule would nullify the changed
will, and you would get your share back.

01:49:38.733 --> 01:49:43.101
You use the syringes in the kit to switch
the liquids in the two medication vials.

01:49:43.101 --> 01:49:46.072
And, as a final precaution,

01:49:47.994 --> 01:49:53.222
you took the Naloxone,
the life saving antidote.

01:49:53.621 --> 01:49:55.847
No, no. That's impossible.

01:49:56.073 --> 01:49:57.516
It is the truth.

01:49:57.687 --> 01:50:00.242
Hand me that vial of morphine,
I'll show you.

01:50:00.242 --> 01:50:05.229
If he did that, if the meds were switched,
then when I got them mixed up...

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:09.991
I accidentally switched them back.

01:50:10.887 --> 01:50:12.061
I gave Harlan...

01:50:12.061 --> 01:50:13.800
The correct doses.

01:50:14.119 --> 01:50:15.715
Yes.

01:50:17.785 --> 01:50:19.771
But not accidentally.

01:50:20.774 --> 01:50:24.369
I taped over the labels
of these two vials.

01:50:25.246 --> 01:50:28.283
The vials themselves are identical.

01:50:30.605 --> 01:50:32.838
How'd you know
that this was the morphine?

01:50:33.273 --> 01:50:34.723
I just knew.

01:50:34.723 --> 01:50:37.891
You knew because there is the slightest,
almost imperceptible difference

01:50:37.891 --> 01:50:40.481
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.

01:50:42.426 --> 01:50:45.963
You knew because you'd done it
a hundred times.

01:50:46.917 --> 01:50:52.560
You gave him the correct medication
because you are a good nurse.

01:50:53.485 --> 01:50:54.442
Then Harlan was...

01:50:54.442 --> 01:50:57.089
I'm sorry Marta, but yes.

01:50:58.169 --> 01:51:00.385
Harlan was perfectly fine.

01:51:01.204 --> 01:51:03.076
His blood was normal.

01:51:03.609 --> 01:51:09.536
The cause of death was truly, solely
suicide, and you are guilty of nothing

01:51:09.536 --> 01:51:12.554
but some damage to the trellis
and a few amateur theatrics.

01:51:13.437 --> 01:51:18.058
In fact, if Harlan had listened to you
and called the ambulance,

01:51:19.568 --> 01:51:22.071
he would be alive today.

01:51:24.489 --> 01:51:26.080
Hot damn.

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:27.887
A twisted web.

01:51:28.807 --> 01:51:32.293
And we are not finished
untangling it. Not yet.

01:51:32.966 --> 01:51:37.206
Marta, when Greatnana spotted you
climbing down the trellis she said,

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:42.173
Ransom? Are you back again already?

01:51:42.173 --> 01:51:46.573
"Are you back <i>again</i> already?"
'Cause earlier that night

01:51:49.626 --> 01:51:52.190
Ransom, you're back!

01:51:54.331 --> 01:51:55.718
Come on, Marta.

01:51:55.718 --> 01:51:59.316
This is stoopid with two o's.
You don't have a shred of evidence,

01:51:59.316 --> 01:52:00.618
You're just spinning a fairy tale.

01:52:00.618 --> 01:52:02.499
Not a shred, no.

01:52:02.674 --> 01:52:05.856
Just as we have no real proof
of Marta's mixing up the vials.

01:52:05.856 --> 01:52:08.490
- So it's your word against.
- You have her confession!

01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:14.596
All right, yeah.
Yeah, we do have that.

01:52:14.596 --> 01:52:17.241
With your permission,
I'd like to spin a little further.

01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:20.606
Much later that night you'd have
to come back to the house

01:52:20.606 --> 01:52:23.108
to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.

01:52:23.428 --> 01:52:26.853
However, this time
the dogs were outside.

01:52:29.196 --> 01:52:31.326
They barked waking Meg.

01:52:31.326 --> 01:52:34.151
No matter.
You'll get the vials tomorrow.

01:52:34.605 --> 01:52:38.947
But tomorrow brings news,
not of a medical error and guilty nurse,

01:52:38.947 --> 01:52:41.918
but of a slit throat and suicide.

01:52:46.051 --> 01:52:51.009
Now the circumstances are perfect
for the anonymous hiring of a me:

01:52:51.524 --> 01:52:53.674
you know a crime has been committed
by Ms. Cabrera,

01:52:53.674 --> 01:52:58.226
you need her to be caught for it,
you cannot reveal how you know.

01:52:59.993 --> 01:53:02.508
Enter Benoit Blanc.

01:53:02.970 --> 01:53:05.793
Benny, look I hear
what you are saying, it's just...

01:53:06.639 --> 01:53:08.679
The body is discovered
early the next morning.

01:53:08.679 --> 01:53:13.426
The police, the medical examiners,
the family, everyone swarms in,

01:53:13.426 --> 01:53:18.417
and there is no possible way you can get to
Marta's medical bag to retrieve the vials.

01:53:18.598 --> 01:53:21.760
You must wait for your moment
when the investigation is over

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:24.772
and you know
the house will be empty.

01:53:25.376 --> 01:53:29.039
That is why you missed the funeral.

01:53:30.205 --> 01:53:33.929
There is no one home to wonder
why you're going into Harlan's study.

01:53:35.165 --> 01:53:36.819
Or so you think.

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:45.403
Poor Fran. She witnessed you tampering with
Harlan's medication in the medical bag.

01:53:45.453 --> 01:53:48.857
She did not know
what you were doing.

01:53:49.187 --> 01:53:53.962
But she knew you were up to no good,
so her mind begins to turn.

01:53:53.962 --> 01:53:58.648
Oh God, that Hallmark movie
she told me about, with Danica McKellar.

01:53:58.822 --> 01:54:00.089
"Deadly By Surprise."

01:54:00.089 --> 01:54:01.598
That's what she
was talking about.

01:54:01.748 --> 01:54:04.867
She loved Harlan. She hates Ransom.

01:54:05.313 --> 01:54:09.349
So the poor girl decides to test her theory
and make this asshole pay.

01:54:09.349 --> 01:54:15.941
She gets a copy of the toxicology report,
I will be honest I have no idea how.

01:54:15.941 --> 01:54:17.780
'Cause she has a cousin.

01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:21.624
She told me, she has a cousin who works
as a receptionist at the examiners office.

01:54:21.624 --> 01:54:23.106
Well, Voilà!

01:54:23.106 --> 01:54:25.876
The numbers, they mean
nothing to her,

01:54:25.876 --> 01:54:29.556
but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat,

01:54:29.556 --> 01:54:33.113
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.

01:54:33.819 --> 01:54:35.363
So, why did she send it to me?

01:54:35.363 --> 01:54:38.703
She didn't. She sent it to Ransom.

01:54:43.796 --> 01:54:47.944
And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,
what is his reaction?

01:54:48.464 --> 01:54:53.345
Elation! He still thinks Marta has
given Harlan the tampered drugs!

01:54:53.345 --> 01:54:56.026
A blood tox report
will prove her guilt.

01:54:56.197 --> 01:55:01.197
He goes to the will reading in high spirits,
ready to see the family tear itself apart,

01:55:01.197 --> 01:55:06.676
secure in the knowledge it will all be
undone when the tox report comes to light.

01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:09.346
And then...

01:55:10.198 --> 01:55:12.186
Marta's confession.

01:55:12.581 --> 01:55:15.071
And everything turns on its head.

01:55:15.071 --> 01:55:19.423
Now he realizes that Marta
has committed no crime,

01:55:19.423 --> 01:55:23.202
and the tox report
will prove her innocence.

01:55:23.515 --> 01:55:27.784
The changed will is gonna stand.
He has lost.

01:55:29.572 --> 01:55:31.175
Unless...

01:55:31.736 --> 01:55:33.505
Unless you decide.

01:55:33.505 --> 01:55:34.783
You're not gonna
give up the money.

01:55:34.783 --> 01:55:36.812
You're not gonna
give up the money.

01:55:36.871 --> 01:55:39.509
- You've come this far!
- You've come this far!

01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:42.757
Just one step further.

01:55:42.946 --> 01:55:48.037
Just one last act,
in for a penny, in for a pound.

01:55:50.653 --> 01:55:52.849
You decide. You are in.

01:55:57.644 --> 01:56:02.969
Step one: destroy all evidence
of Marta's innocence.

01:56:09.447 --> 01:56:15.463
Step two: send her the anonymous email
with a late morning rendezvous time,

01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:22.153
and deliver her the blackmail note.

01:56:24.498 --> 01:56:29.020
Step three: keep your appointment
with Fran.

01:56:30.836 --> 01:56:35.166
I knew it! I knew you were
a no good son of a bitch!

01:56:35.504 --> 01:56:37.379
I knew Harlan wouldn't
just kill himself.

01:56:37.734 --> 01:56:39.386
Yes, Fran, you are right.

01:56:39.550 --> 01:56:43.994
I knew you were guilty as shit.
And now you're gonna pay for it!

01:56:44.334 --> 01:56:45.800
Don't you come near me!

01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:47.782
Don't come near me,
I'm warning you!

01:56:58.550 --> 01:57:02.147
Now the board is set.
Marta will get the blackmail note.

01:57:02.147 --> 01:57:04.116
You'll put the pieces together for her.

01:57:04.283 --> 01:57:06.292
You'll guide her to the rendezvous.

01:57:06.446 --> 01:57:08.404
You'll make an anonymous call
to the police.

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:11.496
They will catch her there
with the body and the burned evidence.

01:57:11.496 --> 01:57:15.487
Marta will get arrested
for killing Fran and Harlan.

01:57:17.023 --> 01:57:17.871
She said:

01:57:17.871 --> 01:57:19.578
You did this!

01:57:20.524 --> 01:57:26.447
She didn't say "<i>you</i> did this,"
she wasn't talking about me, she said,

01:57:26.447 --> 01:57:28.848
Hugh did this.

01:57:28.848 --> 01:57:33.099
Hugh did this, 'cause you made
the help call you Hugh.

01:57:34.489 --> 01:57:36.355
'Cause you're an asshole.

01:57:37.171 --> 01:57:39.128
It would have worked.

01:57:39.495 --> 01:57:44.099
If we hadn't have brought you in for questioning,
so you could not make your anonymous call.

01:57:44.099 --> 01:57:48.154
And if Fran had not stashed
a safety copy of the tox report.

01:57:48.664 --> 01:57:52.605
And if Marta had not outplayed you
once again,

01:57:53.671 --> 01:57:55.658
by having a kind heart.

01:57:57.584 --> 01:57:59.827
By saving Fran's life,

01:58:00.164 --> 01:58:03.425
though it meant her losing the inheritance
and going to jail.

01:58:03.425 --> 01:58:08.524
She didn't play your game,
she saved Fran's life.

01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:13.230
Fran's alive?

01:58:13.579 --> 01:58:14.988
Oh yes.

01:58:14.988 --> 01:58:21.934
Fran, who will confirm this
fairy story or something close to it.

01:58:22.855 --> 01:58:27.892
And send you, Hugh, to jail.

01:58:32.583 --> 01:58:34.209
Yes.

01:58:37.057 --> 01:58:41.785
Doctor, that's great news.
We'll be there soon. Thank you.

01:58:46.432 --> 01:58:49.329
She's okay. She's ready to talk.

01:58:49.782 --> 01:58:53.185
Trooper Wagner, if you could
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

01:58:53.185 --> 01:58:55.660
while Lieutenant Elliott,
Ms. Cabrera and myself

01:58:55.772 --> 01:58:57.924
we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.

01:58:57.924 --> 01:58:59.809
All right. Up. Come on.

01:59:05.634 --> 01:59:07.376
I'm gonna say this just to you.

01:59:07.733 --> 01:59:10.925
No cameras, no courtroom, just to you
because you know it's the truth.

01:59:11.754 --> 01:59:13.637
We allowed you into our home.

01:59:13.637 --> 01:59:16.949
We let you watch our granddad,
we welcomed you into our family.

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:19.177
And now you think
you can steal it from us?

01:59:19.177 --> 01:59:23.508
You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home, our birthright,

01:59:24.364 --> 01:59:27.058
our ancestral family home?

01:59:29.219 --> 01:59:30.408
That is hooey!

01:59:30.819 --> 01:59:34.526
Harlan, he bought this place in the 80s
from a Pakistani real estate billionaire.

01:59:34.526 --> 01:59:36.445
Oh, shut up Blanc! Shut up!

01:59:36.445 --> 01:59:41.296
Shut up with that Kentucky fried
fog horn rag-horn drawl.

01:59:41.661 --> 01:59:45.264
Yeah, I killed Fran, but I guess I didn't.
So what do you have on me?

01:59:45.428 --> 01:59:47.314
Nothing. What?
Attempted murder?

01:59:47.314 --> 01:59:50.754
I get arson for the building, and a few
other charges, with a good lawyer,

01:59:50.754 --> 01:59:53.597
which I have,
I'll be out in no time.

01:59:53.597 --> 01:59:59.733
And then you'll see just how much hell I can
wreak on your life, you vicious little bitch.

02:00:07.237 --> 02:00:08.742
What the shit!?

02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:12.818
- That means she's lying!
- Yeah, man, we know.

02:00:12.818 --> 02:00:16.280
That's right, Fran's dead.

02:00:20.263 --> 02:00:22.648
And you just confessed to her murder.

02:00:35.130 --> 02:00:36.507
Well...

02:00:37.362 --> 02:00:38.918
In for a penny...

02:01:23.044 --> 02:01:24.614
Shit!

02:02:51.809 --> 02:02:55.826
...He's cheating on you, I have proof I know you
don't need to see. Untether yourself - Dad.

02:02:57.275 --> 02:02:59.534
Linda?

02:02:59.861 --> 02:03:02.802
We gotta get the attorneys
on the phone. Right now!

02:03:10.401 --> 02:03:15.017
Can I ask? When did you know I had
something to do with Harlan's death?

02:03:15.994 --> 02:03:19.759
From the first moment you
set foot in front of me.

02:03:23.854 --> 02:03:24.995
Oh shit!

02:03:24.995 --> 02:03:28.962
I want you to remember
something that's very important:

02:03:29.568 --> 02:03:35.625
you won not by playing the game
Harlan's way, but yours.

02:03:37.829 --> 02:03:40.223
You're a good person.

02:03:41.508 --> 02:03:43.174
This family.

02:03:49.082 --> 02:03:51.487
I should help them, right?

02:03:52.741 --> 02:03:55.071
I have my own opinion.

02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:59.397
But I have a feeling
you'll follow your heart.

02:05:05.622 --> 02:05:09.752
