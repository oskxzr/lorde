WEBVTT

00:03.240 --> 00:07.200
When you fall to the bottom, you
realise who your true friends are.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.160
Return to Jesus and
you can return here.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.000
And you're going to throw my stuff?!

00:11.000 --> 00:15.120
Yeah, I don't need it.
I've got all I need.

00:15.120 --> 00:18.000
You've kicked me out of my house.
I don't like you any more.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.400
(CRIES)

00:19.400 --> 00:21.600
It's alright.
I'm just going across the square.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.360
I'll just pop back
if I need anything, innit.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.240
I love you.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.640
I love it here.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.720
Love you too.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.360
But 4am, though.
Yeah.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.880
# Life ain't so great, yeah,
they'll be dancing the moan

00:40.880 --> 00:45.160
# And life ain't Hollywood
for any one of us

00:45.160 --> 00:47.280
# If ever you're in doubt

00:47.280 --> 00:49.160
# Just get your wings out

00:49.160 --> 00:52.120
# It's alright, darling,
get your wriggle on

00:52.120 --> 00:55.800
# Somewhere else. #

00:59.720 --> 01:01.720
Friends ain't your friends

01:01.720 --> 01:03.240
'cause they think
you're a dealer of cocaine.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.840
Oh...pleasure doing business
with you.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.160
Or they want a three-way because
you're Lupita, Queen of the Darkies,

01:10.160 --> 01:12.200
getting loved up
by some white chocolate god.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.120
Not so pure now, am I?

01:14.120 --> 01:15.240
Nah.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.920
And he ain't a white chocolate god.

01:16.920 --> 01:20.280
He's more
a white chocolate unemployed child.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.040
Yeah, he is the Milky Bar Kid.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.560
Nah, my friends chose me
because I am amazing.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.720
Oh, your family don't choose ya.
Oh, no.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.040
My sister is
marrying my gay ex-boyfriend.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.200
I did say we were going to be
more than friends.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.400
Oh, talk to her? Oh, I tried.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.840
He's gay.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.720
He's gay. He's gay.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.120
Mummy, can you close the blinds
please?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.440
Mm-hm.
Thank you.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.840
Cynthia? He's gay.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.400
He's gay!

01:45.400 --> 01:47.720
Not even a hen night invitation.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.320
But who wants to go a kiddie
restaurant with Cynthia anyway?

01:54.320 --> 01:55.560
Me.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.720
Because I got a thing or two planned,
ya get me?

01:57.720 --> 02:01.640
So here I am - BO in this armpit,
bloody period in my knickers,

02:01.640 --> 02:04.720
and a best friend
who loves having me here.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.240
Yeah, Tracey,
when are you moving in with me?

02:07.240 --> 02:10.400
I told ya - I have to live
with mixed-race people first

02:10.400 --> 02:11.600
before I make the full transition.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.120
I've never lived
with white people before.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.480
Right...
I've never heard nothing like that.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.640
It's a black thing.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.960
Yo, are you the guy? For the job?

02:33.960 --> 02:36.440
Uh...mmm, what?

02:36.440 --> 02:38.320
I'm supposed to be talking
to someone.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.000
Oh, Connor Jones.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.200
Jethro, store manager.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.200
Um...yeah.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.320
I thought you'd be older.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.520
It says on your CV
you were previously a pilot?

02:51.520 --> 02:52.640
My mum done it.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.680
She going to throw me out
if I don't get a job.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.280
I reckon she made up some shit.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.560
Ah.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.240
TRACEY: Look, it's simple
and it's foolproof.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.240
I follow through this, I will prove
to Cynthia that Ronald is gay.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.080
So this is what?
Some private investigator shit?

03:07.960 --> 03:09.680
Cynthia finds out he's gay -

03:09.680 --> 03:11.200
some people can't handle
the truth, you know.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.880
I'm going shops, babe.
Do you want anything?

03:12.880 --> 03:14.360
Get tampons.
I use pads, actually.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.920
Tampons are for whores.
Thank you, Aaron.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.600
Cynthia needs to know Ronald's gay,

03:20.600 --> 03:23.120
so we get Ronald to say he's gay,

03:23.120 --> 03:25.760
and - this is crucial - we record it.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.360
The recording is sent to me
when I'm at the hen night...

03:28.360 --> 03:29.560
You're not invited.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.800
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I mean,
do you have a fuck I can borrow?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.880
'Cause I've ran out of fucks to give.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.800
I will speakerphone that shit
to her live and direct -

03:37.800 --> 03:39.040
Ronald saying something like,

03:39.040 --> 03:40.840
"Mmm, I love balls,"
or "Ugh, the vagina. "

03:40.840 --> 03:43.760
It'll be glorious.
She'll have no choice but to believe.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.280
Who's going to record it?
Yeah, uh...

03:47.280 --> 03:50.160
Someone who might be called Aaron.
What?

03:50.160 --> 03:52.120
Yeah, I need to
borrow your boyfriend.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.240
No!

03:53.240 --> 03:55.520
No, no, no. But he's my friend as
well. Ain't you my friend, Aaron?

03:55.520 --> 03:56.880
Aaron, please. Please, please.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.520
Look, all you've got to do is look
nice, go there, sweeten him up.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.640
He will take the bait -
classic honey trap.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.560
Tracey, how you going to pimp
out my man? Aaron, don't...

04:04.560 --> 04:06.200
Candice, just be quiet
and let me think, man.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.760
I'm honoured to help save a woman

04:11.760 --> 04:14.360
from 50 years of a marriage
of deceit and confusion.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.200
But what da rass?
Thank you, homie.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.080
I'm happy to help, yeah?
Eckhart Tolle, like...

04:18.080 --> 04:20.600
No, no, no - don't go quoting
dead people's abstract shit.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.040
Just do what I told you to do, yeah?

04:22.040 --> 04:25.160
Oh, and if you're going shop, floss
and red top milk, not green, OK?

04:25.160 --> 04:28.040
At least tidy.
Oh, yeah.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.160
Yeah, I will wear these, thank you.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.480
Alright, see ya.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.600
So what do you think

04:34.600 --> 04:36.840
is the most important thing
about customer service?

04:38.640 --> 04:39.800
It's being friendly, innit?

04:40.600 --> 04:42.400
Well, what is "friendly"?

04:42.400 --> 04:45.520
Someone's open and accepts you.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.640
Challenges you and that.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.400
Like my girl. She does those things.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.040
Yeah, but in terms of
customer serv...

04:53.040 --> 04:54.360
Hold on, bruvva, let me finish.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.440
You can't have too many friends.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.680
If you've got just one diamond...

04:58.680 --> 05:02.640
You fu... You treasure that thing,
yeah? For everything it's worth.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.200
You know some big words.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.920
I know 'em,
but I don't use really 'em.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.280
'Cause the brain might enjoy
breakin' 'em down and that,

05:10.280 --> 05:12.000
but...the heart...

05:13.280 --> 05:14.720
...heart ain't concerned.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.600
The heart
just wants to know it's safe.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.840
Its door is narrow, innit?

05:21.840 --> 05:25.840
So a tiny little word
don't need to fight its way in.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.480
One sec.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.480
So wh...

05:34.480 --> 05:37.040
(CLEARS THROAT)
So when can you start?

05:38.720 --> 05:40.360
Are you serious?

05:40.360 --> 05:41.560
Yeah.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.000
Fuck!

05:48.360 --> 05:52.080
# I can't, I can't, I can't,
I can't find my friends

05:52.080 --> 05:55.440
# But I don't need, don't need,
don't need, don't need them to dance

05:55.440 --> 05:57.800
# I go
# Whoo-whoo-hoo!

05:57.800 --> 05:59.240
# Let me hear you go
# Whoo-whoo-hoo! #

05:59.240 --> 06:02.320
MEN: (CHANT) Drink, drink, drink!
Drink, drink, drink!

06:02.320 --> 06:03.560
You've got this! Go on!

06:05.920 --> 06:07.280
Oh!

06:07.280 --> 06:09.040
I love my hen party!

06:09.040 --> 06:11.400
Yeah, Mum said commercial food chains
were satanic.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.680
Fast food
became Cynthia's forbidden fruit.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.640
And then so this, like,
chicken nugget hen night shit

06:15.640 --> 06:17.360
actually make some sense.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.120
(SQUEALS)

06:21.880 --> 06:23.560
Hi.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.280
You lot are mental! That was brutal.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.840
Brutal!

06:29.840 --> 06:31.840
Can I get another round of Tangos,
please? Thanks.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.960
I'll get these. Stag night, yeah?

06:33.960 --> 06:36.240
Congratulations on the
life sentence.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.160
Ha, thanks.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.760
She a...she a no-show?

06:41.680 --> 06:43.240
He, yeah.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.280
Why don't you go home instead
of drinking yourself to paralysis?

06:49.280 --> 06:51.960
Firstly, I'm teetotal,
but that's beside the point.

06:52.800 --> 06:57.680
I'm here 'cause life is a dancer,
and I'm the dance, I guess.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.000
Eckhart Tolle.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.480
You know about Tolle?

07:00.480 --> 07:04.600
Yeah.
Yeah, that's from the second one.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.920
Um...A New...

07:05.920 --> 07:07.480
Earth. Yeah.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.680
MAN: Come on, Ron!

07:09.800 --> 07:11.920
Uh, we're playing games later,
if you...

07:11.920 --> 07:13.320
I might, yeah.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.320
# I'll be what you want me to be

07:15.320 --> 07:19.040
# You can take me, take me,
take me anywhere. #

07:19.040 --> 07:20.440
Are you still with the Lord?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.360
I heard you backslid
and fell into pregnancy.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.880
And then into prostitution.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.400
Are you aware that you
have a demonic spirit?

07:25.400 --> 07:27.760
Are you aware that on Thursdays
your mum sucks my dick?

07:27.760 --> 07:30.080
Magdalene, who are you talking to?

07:30.080 --> 07:33.280
You know how you can, like. block out
negative people from Twitter?

07:33.280 --> 07:35.480
Cynthia can do exactly that
with her brain.

07:35.480 --> 07:39.000
It's like some self-hypnosis,
Derren Brown stuff.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.440
Nah, it's true.

07:40.440 --> 07:41.840
How about that?

07:44.360 --> 07:46.880
Yeah, well. If I throw this
in your face you're going to, what?

07:46.880 --> 07:49.040
Look right through me
with chips in your eye? Huh?

07:49.040 --> 07:51.760
It's such a shame Tracey
couldn't come.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.040
BOTH: Mmm.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.080
I can be there for her,

07:54.080 --> 07:57.000
but her trying to end my marriage
before it's even begun -

07:57.000 --> 07:59.480
that kind of jealousy
is best kept at a distance.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.880
Prostitutes are generally
best kept at a distance.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.680
Ronald is NOT gay.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.120
(BOTH GRUNT)

08:22.840 --> 08:24.520
Oh, man.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.840
Oi, don't be a sore loser -
control that pain-body.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.800
You're right. But...

08:29.800 --> 08:31.480
One more round!

08:31.480 --> 08:34.440
I think you better save all that
energy for the honeymoon, Ron.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.520
(LAUGHS) Good one, Peter.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.760
Come on, lads.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.400
How about you and me grab another
somewhere else?

08:44.560 --> 08:46.880
Nah, you're alright.
Hope you find some mates.

08:48.640 --> 08:52.040
Oh, Peter, I think I've
left my mobile in your car again.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.920
Seriously? That prat?

09:16.920 --> 09:18.960
Cynthia, he's gay.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.120
Cynthia!

09:24.040 --> 09:26.560
Yes! I've done it.

09:31.360 --> 09:34.160
Can we have
some more ice-cream at some point?

09:34.160 --> 09:36.120
Oh, someone's phone.
Someone's phone.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.760
What is it going to take
for you to hear me?!

09:39.240 --> 09:40.640
(LAUGHS)

09:40.640 --> 09:41.920
Oh, is it?

09:41.920 --> 09:43.120
(LAUGHS)

09:43.120 --> 09:44.880
Eat your fucking nuggets!

09:48.120 --> 09:50.480
I'm sorry. I'm on my period.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.960
AARON: I bought him drinks.
I let him beat me in blackjack.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.640
I made him laugh.
Right.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.520
But you know
when you actually get on...?

09:58.520 --> 10:01.720
I was charming, so charming!
Why did it not work?

10:01.720 --> 10:03.880
It did work. You got the Vine!

10:03.880 --> 10:05.800
No, but how could
he go for the other guy?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.040
I don't get it.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.760
I need to think.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.200
(SNORES)

10:23.960 --> 10:25.240
Jesus!

10:27.400 --> 10:31.120
What did you guys get up
to last night, Candice?!

10:33.520 --> 10:35.480
I told you I wanted pads.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.640
(EXHALES)

10:42.480 --> 10:45.680
Uh....it's not going in.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.440
Lie on your back and pretend
it's your man's dick, Trace.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.600
Just spit on it
and shove it in like a dick.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.560
No! No! It's not going in!

11:00.440 --> 11:02.320
Like it's your man, Trace.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.800
Mmm...Jay Z, stop it!

11:05.800 --> 11:07.360
(MOANS)

11:07.360 --> 11:09.400
Oh, Jay Z, oh!

11:09.400 --> 11:11.560
(MOANS)

11:11.560 --> 11:14.760
That's it, Jay Z! Ah!

11:17.520 --> 11:20.400
(LAUGHS) It's in!

11:20.400 --> 11:21.720
(LAUGHS)

11:24.040 --> 11:25.040
Thanks for that.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.360
You can change the sheets now.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.840
Candice,
doesn't...um...the help do that?

11:29.840 --> 11:31.400
Who's the help?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.280
(WHISPERS) Esther.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.120
Babe, promise me you won't still be
upset at the ceremony.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.720
I'm not upset. I'm just confused.
I look my best and I get blown off.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.120
It's affecting, man.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.240
Or maybe there's something
you're not telling me.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.480
I'm not gay.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.360
Rejection doesn't have a gender.
It's just rejection, innit?

11:50.360 --> 11:53.000
Look, all I want to know is the
truth. I don't care what it is.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.320
If you're gay, I'm willing
to make space for that, you get me?

11:55.320 --> 11:58.320
It's just a bit loud. Can you...?

11:59.360 --> 12:00.760
You know...

12:01.880 --> 12:04.520
Esther!
The battery is dead on this again.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.360
Have you hand washed my knickers yet?

12:08.360 --> 12:09.400
Oh, no.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.760
She can't put them in the washing
machine because they get bobbles.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.440
Cand?

12:17.440 --> 12:19.200
Tracey, I love you. We love you.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.880
But you're driving everyone crazy,
man! You can't stay here.

12:21.880 --> 12:25.160
Can you at least borrow me a pair of
knickers that are not from Primark?

12:30.680 --> 12:34.120
Ron, you're not going to make Cynthia
happy, because you know...

12:34.120 --> 12:35.960
I know relationships are bumpy.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.480
Like the rolls
on Oompa-Loompa here's stomach.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.640
Oh, my God.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.480
He doesn't understand a word -
Greek.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.280
You know what...?

12:46.280 --> 12:49.960
How about I tell you what I know,
point by point?

12:49.960 --> 12:51.320
Point A -

12:51.320 --> 12:52.960
you told me to stay away from you.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.400
I stayed away.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.880
So you inviting yourself
into my house on my wedding day

12:56.880 --> 12:58.720
is intriguing.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.600
Get over yourself, yeah?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.120
Point B...

13:02.120 --> 13:04.120
..you have lips the size of a boat.

13:04.120 --> 13:09.120
Two boats that crashed into each
other, killing everyone.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.480
Uh... OK. Well, you know what?
I tried.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.920
Point C -

13:13.920 --> 13:15.440
you're obsessed with MY love-life

13:15.440 --> 13:18.200
because you can't face
the mess of your own!

13:19.080 --> 13:20.240
That...

13:20.880 --> 13:22.320
That is...is...

13:22.320 --> 13:23.640
You don't know anything about...

13:26.680 --> 13:29.480
Ooh... That one pinch?

13:29.480 --> 13:32.680
You picked the first imbecile
that blinked at you,

13:32.680 --> 13:35.720
because you're desperate,
pitiful and lost.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.040
He's the very
definition of a waste man.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.680
You'll be the first waste woman!

13:39.680 --> 13:41.400
See you at the wedding!

13:46.560 --> 13:48.320
Sorry I didn't call back.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.800
That's alright.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.840
I know you would if you could.
Yeah.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.520
I'm...I'm really proud.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.040
Mandy must be well happy.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.200
She cried.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.720
Then bought half IKEA.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.520
Can...can we talk?

14:02.920 --> 14:04.360
Fuck, I love this girl.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.000
Before you say anything,
I've seen the bags.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.360
I've already cutted you a key.

14:15.360 --> 14:18.120
And I got you these - panty liners.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.360
For your...uh...

14:23.760 --> 14:25.680
Keys are in there.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.320
Come here!

14:28.320 --> 14:29.800
This is just the start!

14:34.720 --> 14:36.360
I...I don't think I love you.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.800
Did...did you hear me?

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
Yes!

14:44.760 --> 14:47.600
I just need a couple of minutes to,
uh...

14:51.040 --> 14:52.520
I...I don't understand.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.800
Are you going to go or am I?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.960
Well, yeah, it's, uh...

14:55.960 --> 14:57.320
..it's your house, so...

14:57.840 --> 14:59.280
..I'll go.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.000
Sorry.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.320
I've had problems with this
in the past, though.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.200
Can I just confirm...?
I get it.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.960
You're leaving me. I know.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.000
OK. That's great.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.240
I've got nothing to say. Sorry.

15:52.520 --> 15:56.160
Connor?
This isn't exactly store policy.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.520
I think maybe you should go home.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.320
(CYNTHIA SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

16:09.320 --> 16:11.000
A gazelle! I said a gazelle!

16:11.000 --> 16:13.760
Got to be delicate
like a graceful swan.

16:13.760 --> 16:17.200
I don't want hard hands,
or hefty hands.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.520
(SCREAMS)

16:18.520 --> 16:19.640
Oh, baby...

16:21.080 --> 16:23.160
No!
He's gay! He's gay!

16:23.160 --> 16:25.280
He's gay. He's gay! He's gay!

16:25.280 --> 16:28.520
SHUT UP! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

16:30.120 --> 16:32.080
Be very careful what you say.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.880
Our cycles are synchronised.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.560
I know that you are on your period.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.200
I am too.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.480
But that is no excuse
to permanently break family ties

16:40.480 --> 16:42.880
because once the blood runs dry...

16:43.760 --> 16:47.000
..those ties... cannot be unbroken.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.960
Yeah? You're on your period too?
Hm.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.160
The honeymoon...
Mm.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.840
Well, I guess it gives him
the perfect cover-up

16:53.840 --> 16:55.120
to stick it in your bum tonight,
then.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.600
OK, yeah...
GET OUT OF MY LIMOUSINE!

16:57.600 --> 17:00.600
Get out of my limousine!
It is not a limousine!

17:00.600 --> 17:02.960
It's a white car.
They're different things.

17:02.960 --> 17:07.280
It is a tiny white car!
This is my white car! My car!

17:07.280 --> 17:09.000
What? Say something?
Ignore her.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.600
Don't let her energy...
Say something!

17:10.600 --> 17:11.840
Just ignore her.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.720
It's my special limousine ride
on my special day,

17:14.720 --> 17:16.120
and nobody can spoil it.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.240
Yay, we're having fun...

17:17.240 --> 17:20.000
Driver, stop! I said stop.
We're here!

17:24.040 --> 17:26.360
What are you playing at?
It's almost 12:00.

17:26.360 --> 17:28.520
Now you're earning, do you want
to go halvsies on a cabinet?

17:28.520 --> 17:31.400
Connor, if you're going to be
late for work, you should call 'em.

17:31.400 --> 17:36.400
The only company I'm currently
employed by is loneliness.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.000
Right. Sacked.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.800
You're a prison sentence!
You're a thorn in my side!

17:44.800 --> 17:47.720
In my back! Everywhere!

17:47.720 --> 17:50.360
You're fucking acupuncture!

I just don't get it.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.680
Oh, my days, babe. It's calm.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.080
You're the only one who cares.

18:14.680 --> 18:18.880
I give up. I'm just going to let this
be the worst day of my life so far.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.320
Get out of my way
and let me be seen for once.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.040
(WHISPERS) Get out of my way!
Get out of my way.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.360
She said there'd be free food, man.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.080
That's the only reason I came.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.320
Eh, eh, eh! Shut up, Candice!

18:52.320 --> 18:53.760
Who's she telling to shut up?

18:53.760 --> 18:55.760
She needs a kick in the gut.
Can you imagine...

18:55.760 --> 18:58.040
Uh, vows.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.560
Glory to God in the highest, peace
to his people on earth, hallelujah!

19:03.600 --> 19:05.440
Say a few words
for your apparent wife.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.200
Oh, um...

19:12.560 --> 19:16.480
I fell in love...
the moment you saw me...

19:18.240 --> 19:19.960
..for who I was...

19:22.080 --> 19:25.040
And when you fall in love, you...

19:25.040 --> 19:27.160
..lose control of who you
want to be...

19:28.400 --> 19:30.400
..and what you want to be seen as.

19:30.400 --> 19:34.280
But you reminded me that
whenever you interact with people...

19:34.280 --> 19:35.440
Hold up a minute.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.520
..don't be there primarily
as a function or a role...

19:38.520 --> 19:40.040
He's talking like Tolle.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.640
It is the field
of conscious presence.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.200
Let's wire down. Get the fuck out.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.680
You can only lose something
that you have...

19:48.400 --> 19:50.200
..but you cannot lose
something that you are.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.040

..this is me.
