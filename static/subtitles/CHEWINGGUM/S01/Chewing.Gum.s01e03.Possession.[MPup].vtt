00:01.000 --> 00:02.640
(UPBEAT MUSIC)

00:10.360 --> 00:13.000
Now, sis, do it. Do it now!
No!

00:13.000 --> 00:15.600
Do it!
(YELLS)

00:15.600 --> 00:17.920
You alright? Oi!

00:17.920 --> 00:18.920
What are you doing?

00:21.560 --> 00:24.040
If I had Â£1,000 I would buy...

00:24.040 --> 00:26.480
..Brazilian Yaki hair, like Beyonce,

00:26.480 --> 00:29.080
a lip reduction, red velvet cupcakes,

00:29.080 --> 00:30.920
probably a dustpan and brush
for this place.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.360
I mean, look at it. It's boring.
There's not even crime 'ere.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.560
It's like some fake-arse estate.
S'like Diet Cola. It's diluted.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.960
Y'know, forget the dustpan, I'd buy
a train ticket and I'd just get out

00:39.960 --> 00:43.000
'cause I am trying to be something
worthwhile while I'm alive,

00:43.000 --> 00:44.320
you know what I mean?

00:44.320 --> 00:47.080
And these brick walls,
they're dragging me back, man.

00:47.080 --> 00:51.040
Yeah, I'm like a rose,
tryna grow out of mud.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.800
I was born a big thinker,
I'm very wise,

00:53.800 --> 00:56.280
you know, my mind is bare agile.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.320
I'm fast, you know what I mean?

00:58.320 --> 01:01.360
Got my ear to da ground
so I'm alert at all times.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.040
Tracey...

01:03.040 --> 01:05.280
I ain't even being vain...
Off we go.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.720
..I just am...special.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.360
Tracey! (SCOFFS)

01:09.360 --> 01:10.800
Just keep breathing now.
Keep brea...

01:10.800 --> 01:13.240
Oh.
What?

01:14.720 --> 01:16.800
Let's go, have a look.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.720
They've fucking done it!
Bastards!

01:19.800 --> 01:23.160
Uhbuggarshshinewarreday.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.880
I'm a bit busy right now, you know?

01:24.880 --> 01:28.120
Ooh, eew!
(LAUGHS LEWDLY)

01:29.600 --> 01:33.720
# Life ain't so great
Yeah, there'll be dots in the mud

01:33.720 --> 01:37.960
# And life ain't Hollywood
for any one of us

01:37.960 --> 01:41.920
# If ever you're in doubt,
just get your wings out

01:41.920 --> 01:45.400
# It's alright, darling,
get your wriggle on

01:45.400 --> 01:48.000
# Somewhere else. #

01:49.760 --> 01:52.160
Anything else?
Uh, no, just the salad, thanks.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.240
Is that Brazilian?

01:58.240 --> 02:00.680
Oh, do you know, I'm not even sure,
I've lost count.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.600
They've practically
got their own wardrobe.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.200
Looks real.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.240
Thank you. Wait, Tracey?

02:07.240 --> 02:09.920
We went to the same school,
I was a couple years below you.

02:09.920 --> 02:10.960
Meisha?

02:10.960 --> 02:12.480
Oh, yeah. You right?

02:12.480 --> 02:15.280
Oh, the big boss has me running out
buying coffees and salads

02:15.280 --> 02:16.560
every five minutes.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.840
What d'you..?
Oh, what don't I?

02:18.840 --> 02:21.880
Personal assistant to the boss,
marketing manager, sales exec,

02:21.880 --> 02:25.440
no sleep,
but there are a shitload of perks.

02:25.440 --> 02:29.720
I don't like sleazy Stacey,
I like chocolate Tracey,

02:29.720 --> 02:32.360
I wanna...I wanna lock her
in the boot of my car,

02:32.360 --> 02:35.880
I wanna drive her beyond
the most distant star.

02:38.520 --> 02:42.320
Look at that. Huh.
This is my boyfriend, Connor.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.560
Safe.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.240
You two look very...cute together.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.520
(WHISPERS) It's quite a new
relationship.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.920
Connor, what are ya doing?

02:54.920 --> 02:56.720
My mum wants it.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.920
Ah, so Connor, what is it
that you do?

03:00.920 --> 03:02.440
We were just talking jobs and stuff.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.840
I'm a poet.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.480
Ah, wasteman? I've been there.
(CHUCKLES)

03:09.040 --> 03:11.200
Listen, my boss is holding
a recruitment drive

03:11.200 --> 03:12.680
for the sales team.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.480
You should get down there,

03:17.200 --> 03:18.600

03:30.840 --> 03:32.800
CANDICE: Oh.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.200
Why?

03:34.200 --> 03:37.040
Police raided George the Giant's
flat, left the door open, innit,

03:37.040 --> 03:38.200
so we cleaned up.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.960
Why were these in his flat?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.040
So this why ya couldn't
cover my shift.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.360
Yeah. I'm gonna glue them together
and make a big one.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.560
(BOTH LAUGH)

03:48.560 --> 03:50.760
I had to get my sister in.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.120
Cynthia?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.040
Next, please.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.240
Yeah, she'll be alright.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.440
BOTH: Yeah.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.880
'Cause I don't know if I can go back
you know, now I know could go places

04:08.880 --> 04:10.840
like, if I... Well, if I get it.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.240
'Course will, babe.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.440
That's why Meisha wants you
at the perfume recruitment today.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.720
Yeah, but she's not the big boss,

04:17.720 --> 04:19.240

04:19.240 --> 04:20.960

This is what I'm wearing.

04:36.280 --> 04:40.120

Oh, my God, you ain't even sayin'

05:31.920 --> 05:33.640
Ennemis hairont eau de parfum.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.640
Look, no-one in this country is gonna
buy this, it don't say perfume.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.480
How they gonna know it's perfume?
That...

05:40.320 --> 05:43.400
Good point.
I'll, um, I'll make a note of that.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.720
Cool.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.720
Oh, ay, oh, to Big Boss?
Tell him Tracey said it.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.680
We'll be in touch.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.880
Smashed it.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.320
# Waited so long
just to be here

05:59.320 --> 06:01.600
# And now we're bringing
this back to life

06:01.600 --> 06:03.760
# Yeah, we're bringing
this back to life

06:05.440 --> 06:08.520
# Want you to know how I miss ya

06:08.520 --> 06:10.600
# And now I got you
right by my side. #

06:16.720 --> 06:22.520
Fucking Jesus...smack him in the ass,
stuck his cock in my fucking ear!

06:23.440 --> 06:26.360
Devil talks to me.

06:26.360 --> 06:30.120
Grogg in my Jesus cock ear,

06:30.120 --> 06:32.760
rinkeedink goo.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.160
I worship Satan.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.320
Saboo.
I will fear no evil...

06:38.320 --> 06:41.280
Mary is whore of Joseph...
..when you're with me.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.800
..and your stars will comfort me.
God is a whore...

06:43.800 --> 06:46.400
..Satan burned Him...
Jesus Christ hallelujah!

06:46.400 --> 06:48.240
..in the darkness of the fire legion.
Blood of Jesus

06:48.240 --> 06:50.360
washes over this shop. Get away!
And I am many.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.920
Get away from me!
I am many!

07:07.360 --> 07:09.080
Why would anyone have
this many dildos?

07:09.080 --> 07:12.760
This is a business opportunity.
Everything is worth a profit, yeah?

07:12.760 --> 07:14.520
I'm an employed by Winsley Cosmetics,

07:14.520 --> 07:16.200
we are selling the smell of cow dung
in a box

07:16.200 --> 07:18.440
and people with fully
working nostrils are buying 'em.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.960
So?
So sell 'em.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.560
To who?
These lot. Here.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.600
Have a girl's night,
invite every woman on the estate,

07:24.600 --> 07:25.760
do all the pink stuff.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.400
Some of them...ain't fresh.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.040
They're used. They're second-hand.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.440
What? They ain't that bad, are they?

07:36.800 --> 07:38.280
(GAGS) Wow.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.400
Yeah. AA batteries
and STIs included.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.080
OK, well, as a business woman
I can give you a business model.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.880
OK, follow.

07:45.880 --> 07:49.320
You, the seller, have a problem -
150 dildos with BO.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.120
Seller, buyer, problem, OK?

07:51.120 --> 07:53.280
Now what I could do
is go round the houses,

07:53.280 --> 07:55.880
with FTSE analysing and diagrams
but...

07:55.880 --> 07:58.520
..what I propose to you is this -

07:58.520 --> 08:01.280
let's give the people
what they want, OK?

08:01.280 --> 08:03.000
It's an alternative penis

08:03.000 --> 08:04.760
and the most effective way

08:04.760 --> 08:08.520
to solve getting rid of the smell
of the penis...

08:10.400 --> 08:12.400
..is to wash them.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.000
(EXHALES)

08:16.000 --> 08:18.680
I feel like I just wasted
two minutes of my whole life

08:18.680 --> 08:19.960
and I can't get 'em back.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.680
Meisha!

08:27.680 --> 08:30.360
Wow. Tracey? Um. Why are you here?

08:30.360 --> 08:32.480
I was in the area.
Oh. OK.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.640
We normally wait 5-7 working days
before we get back to people...

08:35.640 --> 08:38.400
I just wanted to know, should I start
buying clothes like what you wear

08:38.400 --> 08:40.520
'cause this is beginning to
feel like a bit of a lucky charm,

08:40.520 --> 08:41.600
you know what I mean?

08:41.600 --> 08:45.800
OK, um, would you say that working
in sales is unnatural for you?

08:45.800 --> 08:48.360
Meisha, you know I used to work
in a corner shop.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.760
Look, I can't do Wednesday, OK?
I'm project managing a dildo.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.520
OK, unfortunately you haven't been
selected for the next phase.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.360
Thank you so much for your offer,
really,

09:00.360 --> 09:01.760
but I'm gonna have to decline.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.280
I'm sorry, I'm just looking
for something a bit more...

09:04.280 --> 09:06.520
Good luck though, and thank you.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.920
You can go.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.720
Um, but I work here.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.600
I don't care.
No, but I'm an employee.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.560
Go over there, then.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.800
There.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.000
I thought you definitely stood out.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.720
Which is, you know... (SNIFFS)
..important.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.720
They're going to hire
the daughter of the boss's friend,

09:34.720 --> 09:37.240
they always were, I don't know why
they even bother with recruitments,

09:37.240 --> 09:40.360
it's all about who you know.
Yeah, well, I don't know anyone.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.720
Stepping stones, and all that.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.880
So listen you up for coming
to a work thing tonight?

09:44.880 --> 09:48.000
Posh do, swarming with execs,
worth your time?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.440
No, I didn't get the job.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.960
Ahh, I'll sneak you in,
stepping stones, and all that.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.000
Will...will Big Boss be there?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.200
I dunno if he'll be down
with this kinda shit

09:57.200 --> 09:59.880
but he'll be there, for defs,
so whaddo we say, is that enough?

10:01.080 --> 10:03.680
Well, what's that...what's that for?

10:03.680 --> 10:04.760
Mainly cocaine.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.120
I think Ned and Harry
are partial to a bit of MDMA,

10:07.120 --> 10:09.560
a bit of the old 'mud-muh', so
maybe chuck that in for good measure

10:09.560 --> 10:12.120
but mainly the cocaine, you know?
What's your number?

10:12.120 --> 10:14.680
M-my phone?
Yeah, yeah.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.040
My old dealer got arrested
or murdered or something.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.680
It's really quite sad,
and quite inconvenient but hey.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.680
Old...dealer?

10:21.680 --> 10:24.200
Oh, fuck a dog, my suit's ready.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.680
Look, gotta dash.
Great work today.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.800
Here's my card...

10:30.800 --> 10:32.720
..see ya at krunck o'clock.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.320
Yeah, OK.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.280
# Oh, we'll have our cake and eat it

10:39.280 --> 10:40.400
# Oh, we'll have our cake...#

10:40.400 --> 10:43.040
He give me the cash
and now I think I got a drug seller.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.840
So you'll be their new friend
with the cocaine?

10:44.840 --> 10:45.880
Yeah.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.200
Now, can I just carry it in my bag

10:48.200 --> 10:51.320
or should I eat the cocaine and then
poo it out when I get to the hotel,

10:51.320 --> 10:52.520
I've seen that on TV.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.200
I don't know,
I don't do cocaine, I'm black.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.640
Oh, you don't know Noah?
