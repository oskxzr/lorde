00:01.000 --> 00:03.040
I used to think you might not
actually find the one -

00:03.040 --> 00:06.960
say if you've got, I don't know,
an ugly side or psoriasis,

00:06.960 --> 00:09.280
and that is why I settled for my ex,
Ronald.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.880
To think I was actually going to
take you as a wife.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.720
Yeah, I settled for a guy
who 100% might be gay.

00:22.960 --> 00:28.520
But luckily, I escaped,
and I found the love of my...

00:28.520 --> 00:30.560
My mum's coming. Get away from me.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.160
Hey, Mummy.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.120
Yeah, definitely lucky with this one.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.920
I mean, Ronald was always
concerned about my hygiene,

00:38.920 --> 00:41.000
wanting to go
to these posh functions,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.920
but my boy Connor -
he's an amazing poet.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.960
Yeah, I mean, he doesn't care
about my hygiene,

00:52.960 --> 00:55.440
he doesn't want to go
to all these posh functions -

00:55.440 --> 00:57.480
I mean,
he doesn't care about anything.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.680
Yeah. I mean, I got a man who don't
even want to leave the house.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.120
He's just happy licking me out
and playing on his, um...his thing.

01:04.120 --> 01:08.120
So, yeah, it is great.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.880
Fucking... Argh!

01:10.880 --> 01:12.600

Yeah, there'll be dots in the mud

What's funny?
Tracy!

01:40.400 --> 01:42.040
Sorry, it's just my cousin.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.240
Who's your cousin?

01:43.240 --> 01:44.320
Um, Tracy.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.040
Tracey? That's your name.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.640
No, he's Boy Tracy.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.520
Let me see.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.840
Here you are. Last Christmas.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.400
I'm playing Warcraft tonight.
Can't come mine till tomorrow.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.160
Yeah, I can't tomorrow anyway -

02:01.160 --> 02:02.920
my mum's been bugging me
about some family dinner.

02:02.920 --> 02:07.880
Don't forget dinner.
Oh, my gosh, yes, OK!

02:13.280 --> 02:17.280
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
I'm in. Relax.

02:17.280 --> 02:19.200
Hi.
Get down.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.600
Help yourself to some...BULLETS!
(LAUGHS)

02:23.600 --> 02:25.280
Thank you.
Don't walk over there.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.920
Don't walk over there!
Sorry.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.680
Arggh!

02:29.720 --> 02:32.880
There is a bad smell
coming from the back of the shop.

02:32.880 --> 02:37.120
Welcome to Deathsville -
population, you!

02:37.120 --> 02:38.920
Shoot you in the head!
(GUNFIRE)

02:38.920 --> 02:40.240
Connor?
Hello.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.560
Did you flush the toilet?

02:42.560 --> 02:43.760
Yeah, I promise.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.720
Connor, you're not supposed
to flush the toilet

02:46.720 --> 02:48.040
'cause there's a sewage block.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.480
How am I supposed to know?

02:50.480 --> 02:54.520
Because the sign is there
on the door. It's overflowing now.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.440
You know you've got
shit on your shoes?

02:59.640 --> 03:01.240
Yeah, yeah.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.960
Guess I'll go buy a mop.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.360
Oh, can you buy me a kebab?

03:17.120 --> 03:19.880
It's tingling. Is it in date?

03:19.880 --> 03:22.000
Course it is.
It better fucking be in date!

03:22.000 --> 03:25.880
Course it is.
Urgh, bruv, you stink.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.480
What the fuck is that, man?

03:27.480 --> 03:30.320
Connor done one of his horrendous
number twos down the shop toilet

03:30.320 --> 03:31.480
and burst the sewage thing.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.680
How can one man make so much mess?

03:33.680 --> 03:36.760
I, practically covered in
his doo-doo, have got to go

03:36.760 --> 03:38.680
and buy a new mop
to clean up his mess.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.600
It's every day. There's
something like that every day.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.920
You're there.
What, where?

03:43.920 --> 03:46.800
The rut. Get stuck in,
sit yourself down.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.960
You're definitely going to
get in a rut with him, babe.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.840
He's a bit...you know.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.160
No, what?

03:53.160 --> 03:55.360
Just a bit...mmm, you know.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.080
Yeah... I hear you, doll.
Trace, he is a bit...

04:01.000 --> 04:03.520
Can someone finish
their sentence with words?

04:03.520 --> 04:05.400
He's a bit dopey.
Bit boring.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.520
Lifeless.
No soul.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.880
I just meant he was a bum,
but all of that too.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.440
No wonder you're keeping him
secret from your mum. (LAUGHS)

04:12.440 --> 04:13.880
He's a poet.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.240
Um, nah.
Well...

04:16.240 --> 04:17.720
I'll believe it when I see it.

04:19.040 --> 04:24.120
It's the metamorphosis.
Butterfly clips.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.600
Equals resourcefulness.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.840
Hair follicles.
Grit with forcefulness.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.240
If my boyfriend wants to be all
'mmm', I ain't going to sit around

04:33.240 --> 04:35.640
like a dumbass and let him act like
a fool - I'm going to fix him.

04:35.640 --> 04:39.520
You can call me Morpheus.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.240
What's that on his head?
I don't know.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.120
Who are all these people?

04:51.120 --> 04:54.840
They are definitely people that
are not boring, dumb or lifeless.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.880
(LAUGHS)

04:58.880 --> 05:06.240
Oh, my God, that is Ronald,
my ex-boyfriend, with a man.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.600
I do hereby confirm the fact
that he might possibly be gay.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.360
OK, so the next poet that's going to
grace this stage is...

05:13.360 --> 05:15.840
..Connor Jones from Tower Hamlets!

05:15.840 --> 05:17.960
(APPLAUSE)

05:17.960 --> 05:21.600
Connor Jones? Tower Hamlets?

05:22.600 --> 05:25.560
Surprise! He's here, he's here!

05:25.560 --> 05:27.440
Uh, what the fuck?

05:27.440 --> 05:30.360
Hey, go on, smash it.
I believe in you. Come on, come on!

05:46.120 --> 05:47.400
This is one of my poems.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.360
I don't like sleazy Stacey,

05:52.360 --> 05:57.160
'cause sleazy Stacey's facey's
not as nice as chocolate Tracey.

05:57.160 --> 06:02.880
Chocolate Tracey. I could spot
those goggly eyes from anywhere.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.520
His first time?

06:05.520 --> 06:08.080
I don't know how you knew
I was coming here, but...

06:08.080 --> 06:10.960
It doesn't matter. OK, it probably
does matter...

06:10.960 --> 06:13.480
I don't like you no more.
Whatever.

06:13.480 --> 06:18.440
Sheep can't fly, 'cause they...
they ain't got wings.

06:18.440 --> 06:22.160
I'm going to be more than
a friend to you. So...

06:22.160 --> 06:27.000
Sheep can't fly
'cause they ain't got wings.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.680
He is as bad as your body odour.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.040
Just piss off.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.840
Have they stopped running hot water
through the council estates?

06:32.840 --> 06:34.200
You're a dick.
You smell like poo poo.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.560
Yes, I know!

06:38.320 --> 06:39.960
I have to go.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.960
I've left my...juice at the bar.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.440
It's the universe that's alarmed

06:49.440 --> 06:53.560
Like a superstar lost a credit card.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.160
I just got parred.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.600
Fuck you lot, yeah?

07:20.120 --> 07:22.840
Oh, hmm! So now he's texting.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.320
You know when you just can't be arsed
to read some lame-arse apology?

07:30.520 --> 07:32.920
Are you going to help me,
or are you going to just stand there?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.480
I'm gluten, wheat and meat free.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.920
She ain't any of them things.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.520
You must learn to cook a meal

07:41.520 --> 07:43.320

will sweep you under the carpet!

07:43.320 --> 07:46.360
Off your feet, Mum.
It's "sweep you off your feet".

You told me to drop by sometime
so I dropped by, innit?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.920
Boy Tracy!

08:23.880 --> 08:27.880
He ran off the stage. If I knew he'd
hate it, I wouldn't have done it.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.680
Wouldn't an actual poet be happy?
Yeah, but I feel bad.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.560
You can't read the mind.
Yes, and I can't know the heart.

08:33.560 --> 08:36.440
Boy Tracy,
here is like Downton Abbey.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.760
Let the women do the kitchen work.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.720
OK, Aunty. Really I was just giving
Tracey advice about her boyf...

08:40.720 --> 08:44.920
HEY! Why don't we go shop?
Ha! Yeah, let's go shop.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.440
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) OK.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.320
How has she not found out
about him?

08:50.320 --> 08:52.640
Connor lives in your block.
I know, but who's she gonna ask?

08:52.640 --> 08:54.880
She don't talk to Muslims,
she don't talk to Catholics,

08:54.880 --> 08:57.440
she don't talk to atheists -
basically the whole block, so...

08:57.440 --> 08:59.120
What about you, man?
I don't ask you nothing.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.120
No girlfriend. But I've had sex now.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.440
Yeah. I stopped going church.

and he threw me out the house. Go.

Ronald? What, is he gay?
Maybe. Go.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.200
I've smoked weed. Go.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.080
I had MDMA and speed
at the same time. Go.

That's a lot. Did you recover?
I dunno.

What's that?
Nothing.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.480
It's Boy Tracy, remember, I told you,
my cousin?

12:17.480 --> 12:20.120
Yeah, she told me all about you.
Great.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.440
Auntie, shall we say grace?

12:21.440 --> 12:22.760
Uh-huh.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.120
I'm so sorry. It's never like this.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.920
You should go, I'll save you food.

12:27.920 --> 12:32.240
Thank you, Lord, for your son,
who died for our sins.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.800
All we need
is the love of a saviour,

12:34.800 --> 12:37.880
in addition to financial prosperity.

12:37.880 --> 12:43.000
We hold down Lloyds TSB,
Santander and demand them

12:43.000 --> 12:46.640
to share out the cash monies...

12:46.640 --> 12:51.120
Send Northern Rock to the south,
Natwest to the east!

12:51.120 --> 12:53.120
Lift up the borrower and...

12:53.120 --> 12:54.280
(GASPS AND BREATHES HEAVILY)

12:54.280 --> 12:55.600
My dear.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.360
I think the lack of familiarity
of people around the table

12:58.360 --> 13:00.440
is triggering negative emotions.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.600
Cynthia, don't frighten others.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.280
How many times have I told you?

13:04.280 --> 13:07.280
It's alright, I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.440
You are fine. That's good for you.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.920
Listen.

13:11.920 --> 13:15.120
The world is welcome at my table,

13:15.120 --> 13:18.160
as Christ himself
welcomes the world.

13:18.160 --> 13:23.040
But who are you? And what on earth
are you doing in my house?

13:25.960 --> 13:29.880
I'm Tracey's boyfriend...
Ah, ah, ah! Mummy.

13:31.120 --> 13:35.120
Mummy, I was at Candice's, you know,
that sinner girl from the big block?

13:35.120 --> 13:39.120
And, uh, I saw Connor in-in the dark.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.320
Connor, would you say
it was quite dark?

13:41.320 --> 13:42.520
It was a house party, so...

13:42.520 --> 13:45.400
He needed the light.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.520
John one, verse five.
Seriously...

13:48.520 --> 13:50.240
I have since then...

13:51.200 --> 13:53.240
..been showing him...

13:53.240 --> 13:57.200
..what the greatest love of all is.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.680
Tracey, man, Jesus!

13:58.680 --> 14:02.000
Jesus, Jesus. Jesus.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.680
The greatest love of all, Mummy.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.680
Welcome.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.240
This is going to be fun.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.600
JOY: I've encountered
all sorts of darkness -

14:19.600 --> 14:23.560
single mothers, football fans,
contemporary dancers,

14:23.560 --> 14:26.000
the mentally disturbed.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.360
I used to be in a mental home,
actually.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.600
I was on weed from young.
I got very bad paranoia.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.920
Are you serious?

14:32.920 --> 14:36.560
No, no, no judgment.
Paranoia, you say?

14:36.560 --> 14:38.200
Yeah, I got better and that.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.200
I started counselling people
in there.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.920
Unofficial, like.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.160
Thank God
for freedom from addiction.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.760
I'm still addicted,
just not paranoid.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.520
I am gluten free. Mmm.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.560
Easy with those.
They're a bit boozy.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.000
Don't talk to me
like I'm some autistic toddler.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.680
Or...or I'll get my boyfriend
to curse you.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.240
That's right, Tracey,
I have a boyfriend.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.920
She absolutely
does not have a boyfriend.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.440
That is amazing, I'm really happy.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.840
"I'm, I, me."
Everything's about Tracey.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.680
Everything's about Tracey.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.840
Leaving! Stranger danger!

15:20.760 --> 15:22.720
They don't believe me.

15:25.040 --> 15:30.000
Yes, I have great respect
and admiration for you too.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.440
Goodbye. Bye. Dropped the phone.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.080
Dropped the phone.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.880
A poet. And what do you like
to write about?

15:41.960 --> 15:44.000
Everything, really.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.480
Two-dimensional shapes,
cows, obviously,

15:47.480 --> 15:50.520
patterns, three-dimensional shapes,

15:50.520 --> 15:52.520
love, I'm not going to lie.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.960
Connor, what's your sexual history?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.560
That's a really inappropriate
thing to ask...

15:56.560 --> 15:58.000
No, no, no, no shame.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.400
Often the more sinful your past,
the more special you will be.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.200
Unless you're not serious
about your relationship with Tr...

16:04.200 --> 16:06.000
Ahhhh!

16:06.000 --> 16:08.920
What time is it?

16:08.920 --> 16:11.360
Time for a poem, I think.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.720
Connor, heard you gave your
strongest performance last night.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.120
Heard you had
a great crowd reaction.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.920
You're talking in riddles now, bruv.
You got something to say, say it.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.520
I ain't your brother,
and I dare you.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.120
I remembered. I remembered.
I remembered.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.080
His face was underneath your vagina,
so I couldn't see it,

16:27.080 --> 16:30.040
but he's wearing the same shoes.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.680
Solved that one. I beg your pardon.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.720
Why is Connor here?

16:40.720 --> 16:43.080
To get to know you.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.000
Ah, OK, you are?

16:46.000 --> 16:49.200
I'm Connor, we met earlier.
You didn't tell me she was ill.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.920
I'm Connor. Tracey's man.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.640
Her waste man.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.360
I swear,
if you didn't look so much like her,

16:57.360 --> 16:59.680
I'd smash your face in,
you fucking prick!

16:59.680 --> 17:02.560
There's dignity in the milk of this
cow. You are pumping me dry, Trace.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.320
Is that supposed to be poetic?
It doesn't even rhyme.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.760
Hurry up and dump this idiot.
What?

17:07.760 --> 17:11.040
He's even intoxicated your sister
with alcoholic chocolate.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
Get rid of him
before he does any more damage.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.440
What's he talking about?
What does he mean, "dump him"?

17:15.440 --> 17:18.800
Cynthia, are you OK?
"Are you OK, oh, are you OK?"

17:18.800 --> 17:21.400
"Oh, I'm Tracey. Oh, look at me,

17:21.400 --> 17:24.760
"my crisis of faith amidst the dark
and confusing world.

17:24.760 --> 17:29.560
"I've got a penis in my mouth. I put
it in my mouth. I take it back out.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.640
"Learned my lesson, overcame,
now I'm stronger."

17:31.640 --> 17:33.440
Well, guess what, guess what?!

17:33.440 --> 17:35.200
I'm engaged.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.520
Cynthia, you're going to be fine, OK,
I promise you, you just need water.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.640
I said "I'm engaged"!

17:40.640 --> 17:43.440
Uh. I'm going to be sick. I'm going
to be sick. I'm going to be sick.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.920
Use little Boy Tracy's jacket.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.200
Ah...

17:47.200 --> 17:48.920
Ah, that's better.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.080
Ah, yeah.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.560
That's my jacket.
Oh, sorry.

17:53.560 --> 17:57.960
Don't rescue me.
I'll show you how to be a poet.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.240
Want my fiance. Fee-yon-say.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.720
Who you going to marry?

18:02.720 --> 18:04.840
Who? Beyonce.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.720
Yeah, that's how you rhyme.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.240
(DOORBELL RINGS)

18:14.080 --> 18:16.440
Tracey.
Nah.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.560
CONNOR: What are you talking about?
(TRACY AND CONNOR ARGUE)

18:28.880 --> 18:30.800
And root out all evil
in this house.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.040
Mum. Mum?!

18:34.960 --> 18:36.960
...talk to me properly!

18:38.560 --> 18:41.720
You live on a deprived estate.
You should consider auto-lock.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.320
Ooh, leftovers. May I?

18:46.320 --> 18:48.080
(ARGUING CONTINUES)

18:49.240 --> 18:50.880
(GAGS)

18:50.880 --> 18:52.160
You've gotta listen to me!

18:53.680 --> 18:55.480
(THUD!)

18:55.480 --> 18:56.880
OK. Go on! Talk!

18:56.880 --> 18:58.080
I thought that'd be louder.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.800
Bang! Crash!

19:02.800 --> 19:05.800
What is this? Congo-fried chicken?

19:05.800 --> 19:09.840
What is wrong with all of you?!

19:09.840 --> 19:12.560
What is this stupid, stupid shit?!

19:12.560 --> 19:15.280
"Oh, look at how confidently
I use profanities."

19:15.280 --> 19:19.200
You! You don't own me, I am mine!

19:19.200 --> 19:20.760
I don't want to break up with you,

19:20.760 --> 19:23.360
I'm just deeply unhappy
in the relationship.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.960
What is so hard to understand about
that? Fucking hell, Connor!

19:27.720 --> 19:30.800
And you! Oh, hi, yeah.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.600
You abused me.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.200
It wasn't severe,
it was very mild abuse,

19:35.200 --> 19:36.960
but nonetheless you abused me.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.960
You put hair growth cream
in my nostrils and all over my face

19:39.960 --> 19:43.200
because you were always trying to
change me. Well guess, what?!

19:43.200 --> 19:44.680
You cannot change a vagina!

19:44.680 --> 19:48.320
Yeah, yeah, a vagina and breasts.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.080
Little, droopy, saggy breasts.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.320
And they frown when they sag,

19:52.320 --> 19:54.680
when they think about all the abuse
that you put me through,

19:54.680 --> 19:57.680
and I have lost my train of thought.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.560
Just embrace yourself, yeah?

19:59.560 --> 20:02.800
Because I would rather kiss my cousin
than ever hold your hand again!

20:02.800 --> 20:04.360
Ha! Yeah.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.280
Boy Tracy...

20:06.280 --> 20:10.160
..you cannot fuck your cousins.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.400
Yeah?

20:11.400 --> 20:15.360
We will never go back into a time
when that is OK,

20:15.360 --> 20:19.840
and we will never go into a time
when that is trendy or quirky-cool!

20:19.840 --> 20:22.080
It's legal in the UK.
Oh!

20:22.080 --> 20:25.680
Well, I...didn't know that.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.320
Now, I've got a sick sister
to take care of.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.640
So all of you lot can get out,
or you can help me!

20:30.640 --> 20:33.040
No, not you.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.520
Cynthia, you're going to be fine, OK?
You just need water.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.880
I promise you. Look, 'cause...

20:39.880 --> 20:43.040
I want my fiance to rub my back.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.560
You don't have a fiance,
you just need water.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.640
Can someone
please get her some water?!

20:48.480 --> 20:50.560
Thanks, babe.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.280
Yeah... we're engaged.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.680
I did say we were going to be
more than friends.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.200
Sorry, Tra...

21:04.000 --> 21:05.680
I spat all over Tracey.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.400
JOY: No more tears, my dear.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.800
Let your yes be yes,
and your no be no.

21:15.800 --> 21:20.000
Be clear about what you want
then nobody can walk all over you.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.880
Yes, Mum?
Yes, Mum.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.040
Thank you.
There you go.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.440
I've left your things
in the downstairs.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.560
Oh, thank you. Why?

21:33.840 --> 21:37.000
Well, you cannot live here
after your recent "galavantics".

21:37.000 --> 21:39.640
You want to forget the Lord?

21:39.640 --> 21:40.880
OK.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.280
When you come crawling back
to His gates,

21:43.280 --> 21:46.240
better mind out he hasn't
forgotten to cut you a key.

21:47.760 --> 21:51.920
Anyway, goodnight, my dear.
Cynthia!

21:51.920 --> 21:53.720
No, no. Mummy!

21:53.720 --> 21:55.600
Did you see that?

21:55.600 --> 21:57.920
My mum just kicked me out!
