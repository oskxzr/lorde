I always thought white people were
bad kissers and it's not their fault,

00:03.400 --> 00:05.960
it's just that they've got really
small lips and they can't embrace

00:05.960 --> 00:08.000
the challenge of lips like mine.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.400
And then they try and compensate

00:09.400 --> 00:11.520
for their lack of lips with the
tongue and then the tongue ends up

00:11.520 --> 00:13.240
everywhere, just flapping about,
you get my drift?

00:13.240 --> 00:14.720
But Connor, he was good.

What's his name?

01:05.320 --> 01:07.000
Connor.
Full name.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.840
Connor grabbed my left boob.
Does he have a job?

01:08.840 --> 01:10.640
Without dropping the left boob,
he went for the right.

01:10.640 --> 01:13.320
Why does it matter if he's got a job?
Does Connor have a girlfriend?

01:13.320 --> 01:15.360
Yeah, me.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.640
You ain't even met his dick yet.
Well, yeah, I have, so...

01:18.640 --> 01:21.400
What's it like?
It's big.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.440
How big?

01:22.440 --> 01:26.320
If he put it up me, yeah,
it could've come through,

01:26.320 --> 01:28.120
up, like, out my mouth, yeah,

01:28.120 --> 01:30.880

around itself and strangled itself

01:30.880 --> 01:32.160

01:32.160 --> 01:34.800
That's how big...it was.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.560
A'ight, tell me this, yeah?
Is he circumcised?

What's his door number?
Er, it's...number 20...

Fair enough, then.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.400
Are Somalians black?

02:41.400 --> 02:43.200
I've never been too sure.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.680
I suppose there's various
different types of black.

02:45.680 --> 02:50.200
Somalis look a bit mixed race,
but, like...something went wrong.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.320

it hurts, 'cause he will dump you.

the trash into somethin', ain't he?

Big Leish is the queen of voodoo.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.400
She made one guy wake up
without a testicle.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.480
They call her Turkish trader
of Tower Hamlets.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.720
It's hardcore.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.320
Codeword.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.920
Hello?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.760
Say the codeword, fam.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.760
I don't know. I just need some
drugs to stop me getting' pregnant.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.040
Correct.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.840
We...we was just talkin'
on the phone?

12:18.840 --> 12:21.080
About the mornin'-after pill?
Shh.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.080
Take the seat.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.920
Yeah...looking at the circumstances,
you could definitely be pregnant.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.680
They can indeed swim from the leg

12:38.680 --> 12:40.800
into the vagina,

12:40.800 --> 12:43.560
upwards, like salmon really.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.480
And the father, he is... I mean,
he's never had a girlfriend.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.520
I'd be a single mum.
Shh-shh-shh!

12:48.520 --> 12:51.920
Western medicine is too expensive,
too many side effects.

12:51.920 --> 12:55.480
I can get you original medicine
from my home country

12:55.480 --> 12:57.440
at a great discount.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.000
OK, OK, what is it?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.120
Calm down. What did I tell you?

13:01.120 --> 13:04.000
I don't know. None of it
makes any sense yet...

13:04.000 --> 13:05.880
I told you, "Shush."

13:05.880 --> 13:07.920
There is a plant, Tracey,

13:07.920 --> 13:11.040
found growing on the highest
mountain in Turkey.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.640
Takes about three weeks to ship.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.880
But...
I've only got three days...

13:13.880 --> 13:17.880
BUT...it exists in decent amounts

13:17.880 --> 13:21.680
in a cream I source
at a very reasonable price.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.400
OK, well, how much does it cost?

13:23.400 --> 13:25.360
£1,000.
What?!

13:25.360 --> 13:27.840
OK, get out, enjoy your baby.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.320
Look, I've only got £15 to my name.
Deal!

13:37.680 --> 13:40.880
That's Anusol.
"Effective relief from piles."

13:40.880 --> 13:44.520
Can I have my money back, please?
I'm not even finished, Tracey.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.480
This is for your bum,
and this is Diet Coke.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.080
What's your point, fam?

13:58.080 --> 14:00.880
How is this going to stop me
getting pregnant?

14:00.880 --> 14:02.600
Rub on your belly nine layers, this.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.520
Drink 12 sips, this.

14:05.520 --> 14:09.040
Two hours before or after,
please make sure you don't swim

14:09.040 --> 14:10.560
or touch a hairless animal.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.200
This is Anusol.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.600
Han-u-sol!
Different thing in my country.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.360
It's the same tube...
Same tube, different thing!

14:26.880 --> 14:28.760
Where are you?

14:28.760 --> 14:31.920
Trace.
I'm busy, sorry.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.120
Trace?

14:34.640 --> 14:36.800
I wrote you somethin',
a poem, obviously.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.680
Don't big-deal it.
Just put it on the page, basically,

14:39.680 --> 14:42.520
'cause it's cathartic an' that,
basically.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.760
(READS) "Look, there's a lonely cow
Hey, cow!

14:50.760 --> 14:53.560
"If I was a cow, that would be me

14:53.560 --> 14:55.200
"Until I met you

14:55.200 --> 14:57.760
"So it therefore ain't me no more."

14:57.760 --> 14:59.280
I love cows.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.080
What d'you think?

15:02.400 --> 15:05.360
I think...it's a lyin' cow.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.000
What...what do you mean?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Well, I mean, it's on a farm, right?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.080
There's probably bare cows.
It's not lonely.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.040
This cow is weird,
but it's really good-lookin'

15:14.040 --> 15:17.120
and it's got so much milk, the milk's
just swimmin' up the leg of any cow

15:17.120 --> 15:20.680
that would just dare to...to moo.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.960
No, no. I'M the cow.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.840
Yeah, I think you're a lying cow.

15:26.040 --> 15:29.560
Your mum told me about the brothel
of girls in your bedroom

15:29.560 --> 15:33.400
and how I'm just another one, so
it's better that I know now, innit?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.840
Mum...Mum!

15:36.840 --> 15:39.400
Tracey!
Don't chase me!

15:39.400 --> 15:41.240
This is not a film. Look...

15:51.320 --> 15:53.280
Nine layers.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.200
12 sips.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.280
Dear Our Blessed Saviour,

15:58.280 --> 16:02.760
I need the courage you had
to tell them you were the Son of God.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.200
And I need the strength that you had

16:09.200 --> 16:12.600
to make the switch from R&B
to hip-hop when they doubted you.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.280
Amen.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.840
One...two...

16:23.840 --> 16:25.760
..three...four...

16:37.960 --> 16:39.520
I've got to piss already.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.360
It's my period! It's my period!

16:52.920 --> 16:55.520
You got to have faith, yo.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.000
He lives!

16:59.200 --> 17:01.880
(LAUGHS)

17:01.880 --> 17:06.880
You fuckin' dickhead. This is the
dumbest thing you've ever done.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.040
12 sips?
I'm dead. I'm dead, I'm dead!

17:10.040 --> 17:14.800
You got your period 'cause your
fucking period was due, bruv!

17:14.800 --> 17:16.960
All of this could've been
avoided had you told me

17:16.960 --> 17:18.280
that Connor was a monster.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.680
He's not.
Yes, he is.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.760
His mum said he's got girls
passing through his bedroom

17:21.760 --> 17:22.840
like water through a tap.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.240
He's a grown single man.
What's the shame?

17:25.240 --> 17:27.320
(PHONE CHIMES)

17:27.320 --> 17:29.880
What?
It's just Ronald.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.480
What's he still messaging you for?
You ain't his business no more.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.160
Well, I'm still his girlfriend.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.800
(LAUGHS)

17:37.800 --> 17:39.920
No, no, he's not my boyfriend.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.000
What?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.560
She ain't even broken up
with Ronald!

17:53.280 --> 17:55.120
Thanks, they're lovely.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.440
Just leave them in the bin.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.520
It takes more than flowers, Tracey.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.800
OK.
I shouldn't have to hire a carer.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.960
That's why I have you
as my girlfriend.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.640
Yeah, can we talk about that?

18:11.640 --> 18:14.280
Thankfully, I've already forgiven
you for leaving me for dead.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.080
It's the kind of Christian I am.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.200
So, let's just try and regain
a sense of normalcy.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.680
OK, well, Ronald,
I want to break up with you.

18:22.680 --> 18:26.400
Why?
"Why?" You hate me.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.120
So?

18:28.120 --> 18:31.000
I think it's important to not hate
the person you're with, OK?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.840
I think you should just go
and find a girl that you like.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.960
I like you more
than I like all the others.

18:35.960 --> 18:39.040
Oh, sorry.
Andy, no, no, come in, please.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.280
Look, Ron... Ron, I've met
someone else. OK?

18:45.280 --> 18:46.960
Ron?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.800
Ron, it's over.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.240
OK. Yeah, whatever.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.640
I'm sorry, Mummy, it was just
never going to work out, OK?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.760
And I know you wanted us
to get married and stuff like that,

19:28.760 --> 19:30.760
but the thing is, Mum,
he'll never love me.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.920
He'll never love any girl
because he's...

19:32.920 --> 19:34.920
My dear, can I speak now?

19:34.920 --> 19:36.280
Yes, Mummy, I'm sorry.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.760
You used wisdom and made a decision.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.480
I'm proud of you,
and happy you're OK.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.600
Dinner is here
whenever you're hungry.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.760
Cynthia, come and sweep this thing!

19:46.760 --> 19:49.120
CONNOR: How come you didn't
buzz me, then?

19:49.120 --> 19:51.120
I put myself on the line for you.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.680
Where are you?

19:52.680 --> 19:54.480
You can come to me this time.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.560
I'm in solitude.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.600
Is that that poem in there?

20:23.600 --> 20:25.560
No.
OK, what's that?

20:27.160 --> 20:30.520
The Bible.
Been tryin' to understand you.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.640
I can see why you like this shit.
I've never read it.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.200
I went to church since I was born,
so I don't really need it.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.560
See, your past confuses me
the same way mine does yours.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.160
You're not like other girls.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.560
It's not linear with you,
you get me?

20:45.760 --> 20:50.600
Can we sit in, like,
your house or something?

20:50.600 --> 20:54.920
Yeah. Come on, then. My mum's
havin' a mate over. Rashad or...

20:54.920 --> 20:58.120
Oh, nah, nah, nah,
let's just stay in the bin.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.600
Do you want these?
They weren't even open.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.640
Alright, go on, then.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.560
Read some.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.480
"Give the king thy judgements.

21:14.480 --> 21:18.080
"Jesus and the disciples
gave bread to the crowd

21:18.080 --> 21:21.680
"and the entire multitude of 5,000
was fed with that small meal."

21:21.680 --> 21:23.160
You didn't say on your profile

21:23.160 --> 21:25.560
that this is what you were into,
you know what I mean?

21:25.560 --> 21:26.760
Dummy, pwease!

21:31.280 --> 21:33.160
Don't go all shy. Just get into it.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.240
I want milk!
Eh?

21:37.360 --> 21:38.880
Can I suck your tits?

21:40.120 --> 21:43.360
I can't do this!
Oh, fuck off!
