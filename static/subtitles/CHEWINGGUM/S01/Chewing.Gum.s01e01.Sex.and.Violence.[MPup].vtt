00:01.000 --> 00:04.520
# Life ain't so great
Yeah, there'll be dots in the mud

00:04.520 --> 00:08.800
# And life ain't Hollywood
for any one of us

00:08.800 --> 00:12.640
# If ever you're in doubt,
just get your wings out

00:12.640 --> 00:16.240
# It's alright, darling,
get your wriggle on

00:16.240 --> 00:19.880
# Somewhere else. #

00:19.880 --> 00:21.920
Heavenly Father,
thank you for saving us

00:21.920 --> 00:24.720
by the blood of the Lamb,
your Son, Jesus Christ.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.840
Without you,
we are nothing but sinners.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.920
Thank you for unity.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.560
Yes, Lord.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.160
Thank you, Jesus.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.320
My mum was gonna name me Alyssa,

00:38.320 --> 00:40.400
which means 'sweet angel' in Indian,

00:40.400 --> 00:42.200
but when I come out, she looked at me

00:42.200 --> 00:44.200
and she called me Tracey.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.920
Tracey.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.480
I mean, it sounds like
I eat bacon sarnies

00:47.480 --> 00:49.080
or have sex at the back of the bus.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.520
I don't eat pork, man,

00:50.520 --> 00:53.120
and I don't even want to have sex
with my boyfriend in a bedroom.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.560
Excuse me, I'm...

00:54.560 --> 00:56.840
..I am trying to pray
with my life partner, so...

00:56.840 --> 01:00.760
..for keeping Tracey and I united
in six years of courtship.

01:00.760 --> 01:04.200
For preserving our virginity
thus far...

01:04.200 --> 01:05.680
Mm. Yes, Lord.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.120
(MOANS)
Yes, Lord.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.520
(PANTS) Oh, Ron!

01:10.680 --> 01:11.720
Oh, no...

01:15.200 --> 01:16.960
Yeah.
Oh, wow!

01:16.960 --> 01:18.480
(BOTH SPEAK INDISTINCTLY)

01:18.480 --> 01:19.640
(MOANS)
God!

01:19.640 --> 01:22.080
..for preserving our virginity
thus far.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.920
Your Word says
a whore is a deep ditch

01:25.920 --> 01:29.400
and a strange woman
is a narrow pit...

01:29.400 --> 01:32.600
(MOANS)
..to stay virginal till marriage.

01:32.600 --> 01:36.200
And we will wait until we die

01:36.200 --> 01:38.520
if it brings you glory.

01:38.520 --> 01:39.760
Amen.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.360
Amen!

01:42.360 --> 01:44.080
Tracey?
(BOTH MOAN)

01:44.080 --> 01:45.560
Amen.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.800
(CHUCKLES)

01:49.440 --> 01:52.040
(YAWNS LOUDLY)

01:53.040 --> 01:56.160
Tired already.
No, it's only gone 12:00.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.480
Probably gonna...have a nap now.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.200
You always nap when I'm here.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.120
Yeah. I told you, it's 'cause
of my, um...my, uh...

02:03.120 --> 02:05.040
Your anaemia, yeah.
Mm.

02:05.040 --> 02:08.520
I just really like, um,
spending time with you.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.240
Hey. Chin up.
(CHUCKLES)

02:10.240 --> 02:11.480
Where's the chin?
Here's the chin.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.560
There's the chin.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.800
There it is.
Good.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.280
Don't be desperate.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.920
No, don't be desperate. Sorry.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.560
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

02:30.640 --> 02:34.400
Sometimes, he just lets me stay
and watch him sleep.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.600
I could never let him do that,
'cause when I sleep I get wet dreams.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.600
I'll just be having
a normal KIND OF sexy dream.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.600
(MUMBLES) Oh, Jay Z, don't you dare!

02:42.600 --> 02:45.560
It gets too intense, and then...

02:45.560 --> 02:49.120
..I squirt blood, out my nostrils.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.680
Fuck you! Fuck your mums!

03:10.720 --> 03:14.280
Man's soul is void,
like the universe got...

03:14.280 --> 03:15.600
Oh!

03:15.600 --> 03:17.360
What is he doing?

03:17.360 --> 03:19.280
The universe got...
I'm sorry - who are you talking to?

03:20.960 --> 03:22.080
Wow.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.840
Nah, I'm, uh...

03:23.840 --> 03:25.480
(PHONE RINGS)

03:26.760 --> 03:29.000
I'm writing my poetry!

03:29.000 --> 03:30.160
What the fuck, man?

03:30.160 --> 03:32.560
Listen. Delete me
from your contacts.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.440
Delete me from your conta...!

03:34.440 --> 03:36.000
Mum!

03:42.440 --> 03:44.960
You've got a shift
in the shop, yeah?

03:44.960 --> 03:46.920
Yeah. Uh, yeah, yeah. Later.
Yeah.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.360
Yeah, I've seen you - with the hat.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.480
You sort of look like a maid.

03:52.480 --> 03:57.520
Like a...a modern,
liberated slave sort of thing.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.800
Nah. That doesn't...

03:58.800 --> 04:00.840
Oh. Um...

04:00.840 --> 04:02.440
When you wear the hat...

04:02.440 --> 04:05.840
I like... You're not my maid.
You're not a maid.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.840
I like you.
(LAUGHS)

04:07.840 --> 04:09.960
I like the shop hat.

04:09.960 --> 04:10.960
Ugh.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.480
Uh, wh-wh-what are you doing?

04:18.760 --> 04:20.240
Letting you in.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.400
Oh.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.400
Coo...cool. Excuse me.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.040
I'll get that.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.840
(RUNS AWAY)

04:44.640 --> 04:46.320
Are you hearing me?

04:46.320 --> 04:47.400
Listen, mate.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.520
You're definitely missing my party
to break your hymen.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.480
It's just dinner with Ronald.
You have a party every week.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.520
I ain't even upset. I'm proud.

04:54.520 --> 04:55.760
It's time!

04:55.760 --> 04:58.440
Candice, I'm 24, I'm a virgin, yes.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.840
That doesn't mean I have to want
to have sex with my boyfriend, yeah?

05:00.840 --> 05:02.240
You don't have to.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.920
You can bang someone
on Tinder - it's free!

05:03.920 --> 05:07.240
Set the thing to find someone
in your borough, and walk.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.480
A Tinder bang
ain't even a bus fare, bruv!

05:10.480 --> 05:12.400
Candice is, like, the buffest girl

05:12.400 --> 05:14.480
I've ever seen
on the whole of my estate.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.000
But she's got learning difficulties,
so it sort of balances it out.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.400
So, like, I can be best friends with
her, and I ain't jealous or anything.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.200
You know, if you leave it too long,
you'll tear when he enters you -

05:24.200 --> 05:25.320
you'll need stitches.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.600
Yeah, well, thank God
for the NHS, then, innit?

05:27.600 --> 05:29.480
Babe, let me give you a makeover.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.440
You won't get the D
looking like that.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.400
Candice, I don't want the D!

05:33.400 --> 05:34.920
Or one of your makeovers.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.200
Alright, as long as
you ain't lying to yourself.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.800
Sex is overrated anyway.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.080
Yeah, it's good when it's good,

05:40.080 --> 05:41.720
but it's never...exciting.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.000
Like, it's never a thrill.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.480
Is it, um...Aaron?

05:45.480 --> 05:48.200
He's very... You know,
he's...he's very...

05:48.200 --> 05:50.160
(MOANS)

05:50.160 --> 05:51.880
I love you.
I love you too.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.120
You are an emblem of the sun.
Emblem of the sun. Yeah, I know.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.480
You're my feeling
of conscious presence.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.680
I want him to have a firmer hand.
'Course, man.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.280
I want him to hold me down.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.680
He's gotta be there for you, man.
With his hands. Like, tighter.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.480
Strangle me, like, bear tight,
until I almost die,

06:07.480 --> 06:10.200
but I don't - I just...
I just do a big come.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.280
You know?

06:11.280 --> 06:13.360
Fuck Fifty Shades Of Grey -
that's some vanilla shit!

06:13.360 --> 06:16.480
I'm talking raw BDSM -
bondage, discipline,

06:16.480 --> 06:19.600
wanking, spanking...
Oh, yeah. I feel uncomfortable, so...

06:19.600 --> 06:20.720
Trace.
No.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.960
(SNORTS)

06:26.000 --> 06:28.280
What are you doing?
This is my room, sis.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.400
Thought you might want a shot
at taking the title.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.640
Oh.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.720
Where's Mum?

06:34.720 --> 06:37.400
Evangelising at the community hall.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.600
My dear, your vagina is holy.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.920
I will command Satan
to leave your nether regions today.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.080
Fire! Hallelujah! Begone!

06:45.080 --> 06:47.440
Apparently, there's
a hedonism-inspired plot

06:47.440 --> 06:48.880
for a party tonight.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.720
Here, on the estate.
No, I think it's just Candice.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.760
The devil will be
prowling round her flat

06:53.760 --> 06:55.480
like a lion on a low-carb diet,

06:55.480 --> 06:58.320
so probably better that
we stay here till tomorrow.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.400
Yeah.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.320
Cynthia?
Mm?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.120
What do you want, uh, from life?

07:03.120 --> 07:04.400
Nothing.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.480
I mean, nothing else - just this.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.000
No, come on.
I mean, like, 20 years' time.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.720
You know, you married? You got kids?
Like, something? Something else?

07:12.720 --> 07:15.640
I see...the three of us at the table

07:15.640 --> 07:17.080
like every other day,

07:17.080 --> 07:18.960
except we're really old.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.800
Oh, and Mum is, like...

07:21.800 --> 07:23.680
..really, REALLY old.

07:23.680 --> 07:24.800
Oh, is she?

07:24.800 --> 07:27.840
There's a bunch of bloody tissues
near your bed.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.560
(WHISPERS)
Do you want my period pad?

07:29.560 --> 07:30.880
I don't mind sharing.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.280
Oh!
Oh, Jay Z.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.120
I'm definitely gonna bang Ronald.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.160
Tonight.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.960
CANDICE: Ronald is gonna bang you
before starters.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.360
Just remember all the shit
I told you, and you'll be fine.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.600
I don't know why I lie to myself.
I want it. I want it.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.280
Alright.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.840
I think I'm done.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.240
I thought she was your friend.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.560
She is. Nan!

07:55.560 --> 07:57.720
OK, just let me see, let me see,
let me see, let me see!

08:06.840 --> 08:07.960
I love it.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.760
It's like Beyonce.
Is it?

08:10.760 --> 08:12.640
Oh, my God.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.800
I'm nervous.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.480
Start with the right levels
of eye contact...

08:15.480 --> 08:16.800
Mm-hm.
..and the rest'll be easy.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.560
Yeah.
It's the difference between this...

08:19.600 --> 08:20.880
..and this.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.520
Wow.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.680
It's the 'come to bed' face.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.720
Right.

08:25.720 --> 08:26.920
Neutral face.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.840
'Come to bed' face.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.400
Uh... OK. A little bit less.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.200
I feel sick.
OK. OK.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.200
Um, you remember how to go in
for the kiss, yeah?

08:41.200 --> 08:42.640
Mm-hm.
No! No, Tracey.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.480
Keep it light! Keep it light, man!

08:44.480 --> 08:46.600
You've gotta make him think
that he's in control.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.600
Yeah.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.360
And when he gives in to you,
just sit on his face.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.520
Uh...what?
Just sit on his face.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.280
Just perch on it, love.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.760
Sit your bare pussy on his face.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.480
If he don't open his mouth,
just hold his nose.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.440
Like in the first aid.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.160
Thank you. Thank you.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.160
Oh, Tracey!

09:04.160 --> 09:06.320
Come on, be confident.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.400
You're like fine wine.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.760
What's between your legs has been
fermenting there for 24 years!

09:12.760 --> 09:15.040
You're an asset.
Oh, thank you, Esther.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.680
(CHUCKLES)
That means a lot, you know.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.560
Oh! I feel a bit like...

09:18.560 --> 09:20.080
..like Oprah.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.200
(SIGHS)

09:21.200 --> 09:25.160
Candice, if you want Aaron to hurt
you, you just need to make him angry.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.560
Oh, I don't know about...
Have you tried laughing at him?

09:27.560 --> 09:29.480
Ronald always gets angry
when I laugh at him.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.400
Alright, I'll think about it.
Yeah.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.280
Thanks, babe. I love you!

09:33.280 --> 09:35.400
Look, I throb so hard
it's like my vagina's got epilepsy,

09:35.400 --> 09:36.600
so I really appreciate this.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.120
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.840
And remember, if all else fails

09:39.840 --> 09:41.440
get your tits out!

09:47.320 --> 09:48.600
(SIGHS)

10:14.280 --> 10:16.520
You good?
Yeah. Yep.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.360
Where's your hat?

10:24.360 --> 10:27.240
It's... It's, um...in my house.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.440
OK.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.600
OK.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.120
Oh, fuck. Are...are you alright?

10:38.120 --> 10:40.120
Your nose is bleeding.

held you, I haven't sat on your face.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.240
(MOANS)
Agh! Agh!

21:17.240 --> 21:19.960
I'm sorry. I just...
I always wanted to do that.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.600
Yeah? Ugh!

21:21.600 --> 21:23.080
(LAUGHS) Oh, sh...

21:23.080 --> 21:24.160
Ow. Ooh.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.400
Yeah! Huh!
OK. Almost there.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.560
Huh!
Done.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.480
I don't remember if I was supposed
to wear clothes for this bit or not.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.480
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

21:31.480 --> 21:33.800
"Sit your bare pussy on..."
Yeah. It's...it's too late.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.560
(MUFFLED) What are you doing?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.160
I don't know. (CHUCKLES)

21:37.160 --> 21:39.160
I...I don't know. (LAUGHS)

21:39.160 --> 21:40.280
(SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

21:40.280 --> 21:42.600
# Where would I be without you?

21:42.600 --> 21:45.240
# I only think about you

21:45.240 --> 21:47.800
# I know you're tired
of being lonely

21:47.800 --> 21:50.280
# So, baby girl, put it on me

21:50.280 --> 21:53.480
# Where would I be without you... #
(GIGGLES)

21:53.480 --> 21:55.440
Did...did you hear that?

21:55.440 --> 21:56.920
(MUFFLED) No.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.160
Ugh!

21:59.160 --> 22:00.480
Did you like that?

22:00.480 --> 22:02.720
Er, nah. Not really.
Yeah...

22:02.720 --> 22:04.520
Yeah, me neither.
Come here.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.920
My face is not to be sat on.
