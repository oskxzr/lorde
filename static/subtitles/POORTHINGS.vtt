04:31.773 --> 04:32.774
Ba.

04:33.733 --> 04:35.401
Ba! Ba!

04:37.904 --> 04:39.989
Ba, ba, ba.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.784
- Bye.
- Ba, ba.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.455
A pile of organs

04:47.538 --> 04:49.791
without the spark of self
from a brain

04:49.874 --> 04:52.043
or the pump of blood
from a heart.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.962
Just a butcher's tray
for a Sunday lunch.

04:55.463 --> 04:59.967
Now, who would like
to reconstruct the organs?

05:00.051 --> 05:02.887
And who can tell human
from animal,

05:02.970 --> 05:05.056
if there is a difference?

05:08.059 --> 05:09.060
Come, come.

05:09.811 --> 05:13.231
You did puzzles as children,
did you not?

05:13.314 --> 05:16.025
Is it just me, or is it
devilishly hard to concentrate

05:16.108 --> 05:17.610
when the monster's talking?

05:18.945 --> 05:20.905
He is
an extraordinary surgeon.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.615
His research
is groundbreaking.

05:22.698 --> 05:23.898
His father founded this place.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.844
Have you
mistaken yourself as included

05:25.868 --> 05:27.787
in this conversation,
Max McCandles?

05:28.246 --> 05:30.456
Your physical proximity to us
does not make it so.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.959
Fuck off, old pal.
Get yourself a suit.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.965
You really think that's
where the liver goes, sir?

05:39.590 --> 05:43.886
Can I ask what is the purpose
of putting them back in, sir?

05:43.970 --> 05:45.596
My amusement.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.558
Mr. Max McCandles!

05:48.641 --> 05:50.977
Walk with me
at the end of the lesson.

05:56.691 --> 05:57.692
Your paper.

05:58.693 --> 05:59.861
You liked it, sir?

05:59.944 --> 06:02.154
It showed signs
of a conventional mind

06:02.238 --> 06:04.907
straining hard
to almost touch mediocrity.

06:04.991 --> 06:06.343
- Thank you.
- I need someone.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.786
- An assistant on a project.
- I would love to.

06:09.829 --> 06:11.831
- Are you a religious man?
- I believe in God.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.541
Me or the deity?

06:13.624 --> 06:15.143
Humorous, as you're
often known as the...

06:15.167 --> 06:16.669
It is a joke
of my own making.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.963
I do not need it
explicated for me.

06:19.672 --> 06:21.173
The very devil's work.

06:21.257 --> 06:23.057
Have you thought
of growing a beard, sir?

06:23.134 --> 06:25.386
I look like
a big dog in a cravat.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.679
Kids like dogs.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.431
Uh, this job.

06:28.514 --> 06:29.932
Yes. Come.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.543
God! God.

06:57.627 --> 06:59.795
God.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.132
- Hello.
- Hello.

07:03.215 --> 07:06.802
Bella, this is Mr. McCandles.

07:06.886 --> 07:08.429
Hello, Bella.

07:10.765 --> 07:12.475
Oh. Uh...

07:13.225 --> 07:14.685
- Bud.
- Blood.

07:14.769 --> 07:16.062
- Bud.
- Blood.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.730
- Blood.
- Marvelous.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.065
I'm fine. I'm fine.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.030
What a very pretty retard.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.450
She suffered
a brain injury.

07:29.533 --> 07:30.826
I repaired it.

07:30.910 --> 07:34.372
Her mental age and her body
are not quite synchronized.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.706
Language is coming.

07:35.790 --> 07:38.668
She is progressing
at an accelerated pace.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.128
She is stunning.

07:42.088 --> 07:44.090
I need
to meticulously note

07:44.173 --> 07:45.341
her progression.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.635
You will do this for me?

07:47.718 --> 07:48.719
It would be my honor.

07:48.803 --> 07:49.804
Wee!

07:50.846 --> 07:51.847
Wee!

07:51.931 --> 07:54.934
Yes.
It is exciting, Bella.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.603
"Wee."
I believe she's doing...

07:57.687 --> 07:59.188
Mrs. Prim!

08:01.315 --> 08:02.316
Wee.

08:59.290 --> 09:01.333
Do you not like kippers?

09:07.298 --> 09:10.009
Uh, I am quite partial
to them, actually.

09:10.092 --> 09:13.512
I find them to be, uh,
nice in the morning...

09:36.035 --> 09:37.495
Bella cut, too?

09:37.578 --> 09:39.455
Just dead ones for Bella.

09:39.538 --> 09:40.539
Just dead.

09:40.915 --> 09:41.999
Just dead.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.375
Just dead.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.898
Squish! Squish, squish.

10:08.484 --> 10:10.528
Chog!

10:10.611 --> 10:11.695
Chog!

10:13.697 --> 10:15.991
Run!

10:17.660 --> 10:18.661
Chog.

10:36.137 --> 10:38.139
<i>She... She gathers
15 words a day.</i>

10:38.222 --> 10:39.515
<i>Hmm.</i>

10:39.598 --> 10:42.309
<i>Her coordination
is unstable at best.</i>

10:42.393 --> 10:43.936
<i>In the evenings,
there's progress.</i>

10:44.186 --> 10:45.354
<i>Mm.</i>

10:45.437 --> 10:47.857
<i>Her hair grows one inch
every two days.</i>

10:47.940 --> 10:49.942
<i>- I have a hair diagram here.
- Excellent.</i>

10:50.317 --> 10:52.903
You may go. See you tomorrow.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.865
Sir, where did she come from?

10:57.199 --> 10:59.743
I believe your job
is collecting data.

10:59.827 --> 11:03.205
When I add inane questions
to it, I'll let you know.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.796
"And so, when they returned
from the wood,

11:10.880 --> 11:14.592
"she was reunited
with her Mummy and Daddy.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.636
"That night, for dinner,

11:17.720 --> 11:20.097
"they ate cake
until they were sick.

11:20.806 --> 11:24.310
"They were so happy
to be back together."

11:27.188 --> 11:29.106
You me Daddy, God?

11:30.191 --> 11:32.276
- I...
- Prim say you not be.

11:33.152 --> 11:34.737
Bella nowhere girl.

11:36.030 --> 11:38.574
Where that be? Nowhere?

11:39.408 --> 11:40.910
You are an orphan.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.078
Your parents died.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.249
Then you cut parents up, God?

11:47.333 --> 11:48.334
No.

11:48.918 --> 11:50.753
They were my friends.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.298
They were brave explorers,

11:55.466 --> 11:57.593
and they were killed
in a landslide

11:57.676 --> 11:59.345
in South America.

12:00.221 --> 12:03.766
They pushed the boundaries
of what was known,

12:03.849 --> 12:05.601
and they paid the price.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.479
But that is the only way
to live, Bella.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.650
They sent you to me
to care for you.

12:15.069 --> 12:16.070
Dead?

12:17.488 --> 12:19.490
I'm afraid so, my darling.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.785
Poor Bella.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.330
But love God.

12:32.086 --> 12:33.462
Sleep here.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.423
No.

12:47.309 --> 12:50.187
Good night, dear Bella.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.235
This, parents.

12:56.986 --> 12:58.404
Peru, yes.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.950
Why you pen book every nut?

13:03.033 --> 13:05.244
I must note down
your nutritional intake.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.501
How many?

13:13.377 --> 13:14.420
Um...

13:18.424 --> 13:20.592
Tell Bella other places.

13:21.385 --> 13:24.138
That's Lisbon, Portugal.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.016
The south of France. The Alps.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.688
Australia.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.858
Far away and dangerous,
in both people and animal.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.068
Bella want look at world.

13:40.904 --> 13:41.947
Just...

13:43.615 --> 13:44.742
- Bella.
- Hmm?

13:48.787 --> 13:51.999
Bella, I don't think
we're allowed up here.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.083
Let's just...

14:08.265 --> 14:09.266
Bella.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.354
Bella.

14:14.855 --> 14:15.856
No.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.651
Bella, this is dangerous.

14:36.627 --> 14:37.628
Bella.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.589
No, Bella.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.443
God.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.114
Outside must go.

15:06.115 --> 15:09.076
Outside? No, we work.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.619
Cut fingers?

15:11.412 --> 15:12.871
Candles take me.
Candles.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.331
Of...
Of course I can. If...

15:14.415 --> 15:15.666
No.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.917
Yes. Out!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.961
Has she ever been outside?

15:19.044 --> 15:20.045
No.

15:20.129 --> 15:22.673
I have created
a perfectly entertaining

15:22.756 --> 15:24.299
and safe world for Bella.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.384
Now.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.137
- Bella.
- Now!

15:31.306 --> 15:33.267
- Now!
- Bella.

16:00.461 --> 16:04.715
You know, so many things
outside can kill you, Bella.

16:04.798 --> 16:05.799
Kill dead?

16:05.883 --> 16:08.177
Snakes, carriages,
sharp-faced birds,

16:08.260 --> 16:11.513
earthquakes, inhalation
of toxic grass seeds.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.416
Bella.

16:40.209 --> 16:41.960
Bella.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.275
Bella. Look.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.412
- Kill it.
- What?

17:30.842 --> 17:32.678
Why you funny thumbs, God?

17:37.641 --> 17:39.643
Once when I was very small,

17:40.310 --> 17:43.689
my father pinned my thumbs
into a small iron case

17:43.772 --> 17:46.942
to see whether he could retard
the growth cycle of bones.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.821
Now, the pain was so great,

17:50.904 --> 17:53.156
to stop myself from weeping,

17:53.240 --> 17:56.285
I would stare deeply
into my other fingers,

17:57.286 --> 17:59.121
and simply by observation,

17:59.830 --> 18:03.417
begin to parse out
the epidemiological elements.

18:04.418 --> 18:05.794
When he came back,

18:05.877 --> 18:09.089
to his surprise,
I was smiling.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.050
Good God.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.387
He was a man
of unconventional mind.

18:23.604 --> 18:24.688
Time to go.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.567
Uh, a storm approaches.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.990
Why must you scare her so?

18:35.073 --> 18:36.366
She's an experiment,

18:36.450 --> 18:38.285
and I must control
the conditions

18:38.368 --> 18:41.580
or our results
will not be pure. Mm!

18:53.175 --> 18:55.302
Stop!
God, we go!

18:55.385 --> 18:56.428
No, Bella.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.138
Bella want walk in ice cream.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.222
No.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.557
Bella wants!

19:00.641 --> 19:02.934
My face. People scared of God.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.019
Laugh at God.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.562
God lovely.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.022
Like dog face.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.149
Woof. Woof, woof!

19:09.232 --> 19:10.567
Quite.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.861
- Stop! Me walk.
- No!

19:15.906 --> 19:18.116
No now? No never?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.035
Just no.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.456
Ahhh!

19:27.584 --> 19:29.961
- Bella!
- No!

19:30.045 --> 19:32.756
- No! No! No!
- Hey! Bella!

19:34.341 --> 19:35.342
No!

19:39.888 --> 19:41.973
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No!

19:42.057 --> 19:43.558
No! No!

19:57.364 --> 19:59.282
I'm sorry, my darling.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.911
Mother of God.

21:33.502 --> 21:34.795
What did you do to her?

21:35.420 --> 21:36.671
Why are you hiding her?

21:37.255 --> 21:39.375
Tell me what all this means,
or I'll go to the police.

21:42.385 --> 21:45.472
I shall.
For it is a happy tale.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.116
<i>It is rare to get a body,</i>

22:05.200 --> 22:07.160
<i>albeit dead,
but so close to life.</i>

22:07.661 --> 22:09.913
Rigor had not set in.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.499
The body had hardly cooled.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.543
<i>No pulse.</i>

22:15.168 --> 22:16.586
<i>But some electric currents,</i>

22:16.670 --> 22:18.171
so I could have
kept her alive.

22:18.255 --> 22:19.589
But you didn't.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.552
<i>I knew nothing of the life
she had abandoned,</i>

22:23.635 --> 22:27.556
<i>except she hated it so much
that she had chosen not to be,</i>

22:27.639 --> 22:28.723
and forever.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.433
What would she feel

22:31.226 --> 22:32.477
<i>on being dragged</i>

22:32.561 --> 22:35.856
<i>from her carefully chosen
blank eternity</i>

22:35.939 --> 22:38.859
and forced to be put
in one of our understaffed,

22:38.942 --> 22:42.821
poorly-equipped madhouses,
reformatories or jails?

22:43.947 --> 22:45.574
<i>For in this Christian nation,</i>

22:45.657 --> 22:48.827
<i>suicide is treated
as lunacy or crime.</i>

22:48.910 --> 22:51.288
<i>Who was I to decide her fate?</i>

22:51.955 --> 22:55.500
But then there was also,
on my part, a recognition.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.712
All my research
had come to this moment.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.423
Fate had brought me
a dead body,

23:01.506 --> 23:02.674
<i>and a live infant.</i>

23:02.757 --> 23:03.967
It was obvious.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.051
It was?

23:05.135 --> 23:06.803
Take the infant's brain out

23:06.887 --> 23:08.680
and put it
in the full-grown woman,

23:08.763 --> 23:10.140
reanimate her, and watch.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.017
Jesus!

24:04.611 --> 24:05.946
She knows?

24:06.029 --> 24:07.322
No.

24:07.405 --> 24:08.406
Who was she?

24:08.990 --> 24:10.075
No idea.

24:11.368 --> 24:14.412
But would you rather
the world did not have Bella?

26:54.239 --> 26:55.448
- Mrs. Prim?
- Hmm?

26:56.199 --> 26:58.118
Bella discover happy
when she want.

26:58.201 --> 26:59.202
Uh-huh.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.413
You are a sour face,
but I fix you.

27:03.915 --> 27:05.041
Close eyes.

27:07.210 --> 27:08.253
Oh! No!

27:08.753 --> 27:10.547
Just wait. It takes a moment.

27:12.132 --> 27:14.008
She grabbed my hairy business.

27:14.509 --> 27:15.510
She's sick!

27:15.593 --> 27:16.594
Bella.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.596
Bella have discover
something I must share.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.681
Watch.

27:20.223 --> 27:22.725
- What if put cucumber in me?
- No.

27:24.269 --> 27:26.020
Bella! Bella!

27:26.855 --> 27:29.149
Cease working yourself
immediately.

27:29.232 --> 27:30.233
What?

27:30.316 --> 27:33.153
In polite society,
that is not done.

27:33.736 --> 27:34.737
Oh.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.365
Oh.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.659
Just do not.

27:49.169 --> 27:51.296
What... is that?

27:52.046 --> 27:55.216
My father took out
my oxyntic and pyloric glands,

27:55.300 --> 27:57.886
so I must make
my own gastric juices.

27:58.469 --> 27:59.846
Why in God's name
would he do that?

27:59.929 --> 28:02.348
To discover what no one knew.

28:02.432 --> 28:05.185
Turns out we need them.
Ideally.

28:06.936 --> 28:07.979
Bella,

28:09.022 --> 28:10.398
you have not eaten.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.359
Do not.

28:21.784 --> 28:22.952
Good night.

28:24.412 --> 28:25.413
'Night.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.724
You know,

28:44.807 --> 28:47.810
I'm actually something
of a romantic, Max.

28:48.436 --> 28:49.479
What?

28:49.562 --> 28:52.232
I believe I see love
between you and Bella.

28:53.650 --> 28:55.193
Uh, I... She is...

28:55.276 --> 28:57.779
Perhaps you should marry her.

28:58.112 --> 28:59.113
What?

28:59.197 --> 29:00.448
I think she loves you.

29:01.324 --> 29:02.492
Oh.

29:02.867 --> 29:06.204
<i>I've seen people
look at each other with love,</i>

29:06.287 --> 29:07.372
<i>as an observer.</i>

29:07.455 --> 29:09.582
<i>Not the subject, of course.
I see it.</i>

29:11.084 --> 29:12.085
<i>You do?</i>

29:13.586 --> 29:14.587
<i>I, um...</i>

29:15.171 --> 29:18.049
I do have feelings for her.

29:18.132 --> 29:19.634
So, you would?

29:20.468 --> 29:22.679
Take Bella out.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.722
Bella...

29:25.139 --> 29:26.140
Um...

29:26.724 --> 29:27.725
I...

29:30.478 --> 29:31.479
Feel funny?

29:37.902 --> 29:38.903
- Um...
- Do Bella.

29:45.243 --> 29:47.078
<i>I was wondering</i>

29:47.161 --> 29:48.663
if perhaps
you were raising her

29:48.746 --> 29:49.747
to be your mistress.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.208
A dark thought unworthy of me,
I know.

29:53.459 --> 29:56.587
So, you are not laying
with her?

29:57.964 --> 30:02.051
Spermatic ejaculation can only
induce homeostasis in me

30:02.135 --> 30:04.846
if accompanied
by prolonged stimulation

30:04.929 --> 30:06.264
of higher nerve centers

30:06.347 --> 30:08.516
whose pressure
on the ductless glands

30:08.599 --> 30:10.310
changes the chemistry
of my blood

30:10.393 --> 30:12.562
not for a few
spasmodic minutes,

30:12.645 --> 30:14.022
but for many days.

30:15.398 --> 30:16.399
What?

30:16.482 --> 30:18.818
I am a eunuch
and can't fuck her.

30:19.235 --> 30:22.155
To get a sexual response
from my body

30:22.238 --> 30:24.741
would take the same amount
of electricity

30:24.824 --> 30:25.867
as runs North London.

30:26.242 --> 30:29.370
- Mm-hmm.
- Besides, my paternal feelings

30:29.454 --> 30:31.831
seem to outweigh
my sexual thoughts.

30:33.583 --> 30:36.210
<i>I apologize
for my own dark thoughts.</i>

30:36.294 --> 30:37.503
<i>Not dark at all.</i>

30:37.587 --> 30:41.758
<i>Men's, indeed all sexuality,
is basically immoral.</i>

30:41.841 --> 30:43.760
<i>Not all, sir.</i>

30:43.843 --> 30:45.678
<i>Do you wish
to marry her or not?</i>

30:47.221 --> 30:49.891
I wish to marry you.
Be my wife.

30:58.107 --> 31:00.276
Let us touch
each other's genital pieces.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.944
Uh... No. No.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.155
I do not wish
to take advantage of you.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.406
You are special.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.283
When we are wed.

31:14.207 --> 31:15.291
One condition.

31:15.375 --> 31:18.127
She must desire it also,
I understand.

31:18.211 --> 31:19.796
Two conditions, then.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.172
That one you said,

31:21.255 --> 31:25.093
and you must live here
with me, always.

31:26.469 --> 31:29.138
<i>I will have
a legal agreement drawn up.</i>

31:37.688 --> 31:38.731
Hmm.

31:55.540 --> 31:56.666
Curious contract.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.793
There are several
spelling errors.

31:58.876 --> 32:01.796
Oh. Immaterial to
the legal bindingness of it,

32:01.879 --> 32:03.005
I assure you.

32:04.757 --> 32:08.928
Must be quite a woman
to warrant such binding.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.893
If you'll excuse me,
I need to use the facilities.

32:17.728 --> 32:20.356
Are you five years old that
you can't hold your water?

32:20.815 --> 32:21.899
Weak bladder, sir.

32:21.983 --> 32:25.069
Like my father before me
and his before him.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.613
You may have prostate cancer.
Look into it.

32:28.448 --> 32:29.449
Will do.

33:35.264 --> 33:38.518
Ms. Bella Baxter, as per
your contract, no doubt.

33:39.310 --> 33:41.270
Good afternoon, visiting man.

33:42.230 --> 33:43.314
Want my hat?

33:44.148 --> 33:45.441
Would it suit me?

33:46.108 --> 33:47.777
Yes.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.112
It is foolish good.

33:50.196 --> 33:52.281
I had to meet this woman
who would inspire

33:52.365 --> 33:55.201
such a contract of marriage
that imprisons her.

33:56.118 --> 33:57.370
What you mean?

33:57.453 --> 33:58.496
You shall live here,

33:58.579 --> 34:01.958
travel with Mr. Max McCandles
and Baxter abroad,

34:02.041 --> 34:03.918
but not go forth in the city.

34:04.502 --> 34:05.753
I see.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.172
They love me tight.

34:08.256 --> 34:09.757
I understand why.

34:10.258 --> 34:12.093
I have to pinch you,
to see if you are real.

34:12.176 --> 34:13.761
You will not... Ah.

34:16.847 --> 34:18.057
Who is you?

34:20.810 --> 34:22.812
Mr. Duncan Wedderburn.

34:53.509 --> 34:54.510
Open.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.480
How you get up here?

35:06.897 --> 35:08.482
Shh.

35:08.566 --> 35:09.567
I climbed.

35:28.544 --> 35:29.962
You were watch me long?

35:30.046 --> 35:31.422
Not long.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.341
You did not see me
working on myself

35:33.424 --> 35:34.925
to get happiness, did you?

35:36.052 --> 35:38.054
It is not polites, I know.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.561
Do not care
for polite society.

35:45.645 --> 35:46.771
It's fucking boring.

35:47.563 --> 35:48.856
Destroys one's soul.

35:50.024 --> 35:51.525
God not believe in soul.

35:52.985 --> 35:56.155
I think God's the actual
author of the soul idea.

35:56.697 --> 35:58.199
Godwin Baxter?

35:58.574 --> 36:00.242
That burnt dog.

36:00.326 --> 36:01.869
What is that story?

36:02.745 --> 36:05.289
You are a prisoner
and I aim to free you.

36:07.708 --> 36:10.336
Something in you,
some hungry being,

36:10.419 --> 36:13.255
hungry for experience,
freedom, touch.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.383
To see the unknown
and know it.

36:16.217 --> 36:18.552
So, why am I here, you ask?

36:19.720 --> 36:22.723
I'm going to Lisbon on Friday.
I'd like you to come.

36:22.807 --> 36:24.600
Lisbon of Portugal?

36:24.684 --> 36:26.769
That is the Lisbon I speak of.

36:28.437 --> 36:29.647
God never allow it.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.901
That's why I'm not asking him.

36:35.569 --> 36:36.737
I'm asking you.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.242
Bella not safe with you,
I think.

36:41.325 --> 36:44.495
You are absolutely... not.

36:59.552 --> 37:03.013
May I have a moment
of value time, dear God?

37:03.097 --> 37:04.473
Of course, Bella.

37:04.557 --> 37:07.226
I wanted to tell you big news.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.353
Bella is dizzy with excite.

37:09.812 --> 37:10.813
What is it?

37:10.896 --> 37:12.606
Tonight, at midnight,

37:13.399 --> 37:17.027
I secretly run away
with one Duncan Wedderburn.

37:17.111 --> 37:18.154
What?

37:18.237 --> 37:19.613
You will wish to stop me.

37:19.697 --> 37:20.740
I shall stop you.

37:20.823 --> 37:22.700
You hold Bella too tight.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.202
I must set forth into waters.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.328
We can travel.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.331
You, me, and Max whom,
I will remind you,

37:29.415 --> 37:30.750
you are betrothed to.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.626
I will marry Max,

37:32.710 --> 37:35.212
as he seems right for that,

37:35.296 --> 37:39.091
but first, I shall adventure
on Duncan Wedderburn

37:39.175 --> 37:42.928
who, I think,
cares little of damage to me,

37:43.012 --> 37:46.557
but will be interesting
as well.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.225
I can't let you go.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.067
Kiss me and set me forth.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.028
If you do not,

37:59.779 --> 38:03.407
Bella's insides
shall turn rotten with hate.

38:03.783 --> 38:05.785
- Hate?
- Hate.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.295
Unpack those bags, Prim.

38:16.378 --> 38:18.339
Godwin has told me your plan.

38:18.422 --> 38:19.632
I do not blame you, Bella.

38:19.715 --> 38:21.550
That man is a cad and a rake.

38:21.634 --> 38:22.676
He has insidious ways

38:22.760 --> 38:24.595
of getting under
a naive woman's skin.

38:24.678 --> 38:27.097
It is mostly his eyes on mine.

38:27.181 --> 38:29.892
And his hands
when between Bella's legs

38:30.434 --> 38:32.603
and whisper words I can't hear

38:32.686 --> 38:34.688
but heat in my body.

38:34.772 --> 38:36.232
Jesus, Bella.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.692
We are engaged.
I love you.

38:38.776 --> 38:40.945
And when I return,
we marriage,

38:41.028 --> 38:43.197
and be happy
as two doves on a branch.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.032
- You think I need travel hat?
- No!

38:45.574 --> 38:46.575
This will not do.

38:47.201 --> 38:48.619
It cannot!

38:48.702 --> 38:49.954
I'll see to this man myself.

38:50.704 --> 38:52.248
I will beat his handsome face

38:52.331 --> 38:54.625
into a porridge
of blood and bones!

38:54.708 --> 38:56.502
Max, you are flushed,

38:56.585 --> 38:58.921
and I am too
at sight of different Max.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.048
I apologize,
but I will not let a man

39:01.131 --> 39:03.425
that I know has nothing
but ill intent in his mind

39:03.509 --> 39:06.136
and nothing for you
in his heart trick you.

39:06.220 --> 39:08.973
I will smash
his fucking head in.

39:15.938 --> 39:16.939
Mm.

39:24.446 --> 39:25.823
Bella? It...

39:30.119 --> 39:31.120
Bella.

39:39.336 --> 39:41.714
Goodbye, later dove.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.425
I will see you
after grand adventure.

39:46.594 --> 39:47.595
God?

40:28.260 --> 40:29.261
She's gone.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.723
I am having port
for breakfast.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.850
It is strangely delicious.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.685
Why did you not stop her?

40:37.728 --> 40:39.897
She is a being of free will.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.403
She's now out there. Alone.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.447
She will be fine.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.449
I'm a fool.
I should have stopped her.

40:50.824 --> 40:52.618
We are men of science.

40:53.661 --> 40:57.206
This emotionality is unseemly.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.252
I just hope she's all right.

41:24.692 --> 41:26.002
You are
the most beautiful woman

41:26.026 --> 41:27.027
I've ever seen.

41:27.820 --> 41:29.613
I will not lie,
I have been with many.

41:30.197 --> 41:31.657
Mrs. Prim said you were wolf

41:31.740 --> 41:33.534
with scent
of hundred women on you.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.035
She undersells it.

41:35.661 --> 41:38.247
Okay. Oysters.

41:38.330 --> 41:39.873
Have you had them before?

41:40.165 --> 41:41.208
I have not.

41:45.629 --> 41:47.548
Shuck, chuck and bubble.

41:50.092 --> 41:51.093
Mm.

41:53.053 --> 41:54.054
Mm.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.476
Rollicking.

42:02.146 --> 42:04.231
Rollicking.

42:07.985 --> 42:09.153
Wait. Bella.

42:18.537 --> 42:19.580
So, nuns and monks

42:19.663 --> 42:21.582
would starch their clothes
with egg whites

42:21.665 --> 42:23.792
and, with the yolks,
make these tarts.

42:24.460 --> 42:25.627
Now, how to eat them?

42:25.711 --> 42:27.421
I will guess
through the mouth.

42:27.504 --> 42:30.549
They must not be eaten
dainty flake by dainty flake,

42:30.632 --> 42:33.469
but inhaled with gusto,
like life itself.

42:40.017 --> 42:41.393
Incredible.

42:42.352 --> 42:44.313
Who made these?
We need more.

42:44.396 --> 42:46.940
No more. One's enough.
Any more is too much.

42:47.941 --> 42:49.234
It's siesta time.

42:49.568 --> 42:50.986
What is siesta?

43:17.930 --> 43:20.474
Why do people not just do this

43:20.557 --> 43:21.850
all the time?

43:23.102 --> 43:25.729
Well, at the risk
of being immodest,

43:25.813 --> 43:28.774
you've just been thrice fucked
by the very best.

43:28.857 --> 43:29.983
It's probable no other man

43:30.067 --> 43:31.787
would ever bring you
to the raptures I have.

43:33.403 --> 43:34.530
I feel bad for you.

43:36.156 --> 43:39.618
Well, then it will just be you
I do furious jumping with.

43:39.701 --> 43:42.037
Furious jumping?

43:42.704 --> 43:43.747
I love that.

43:44.206 --> 43:45.624
I'm rested.

43:46.416 --> 43:47.543
Let us go again.

43:47.626 --> 43:48.752
Again?

43:49.461 --> 43:51.088
Unfortunately,

43:51.171 --> 43:52.798
even I have my limits.

43:52.881 --> 43:55.175
Men cannot keep coming back
for more.

43:55.259 --> 43:57.553
It is a physiological problem?

43:58.303 --> 43:59.763
A weakness in men?

43:59.847 --> 44:02.141
Mm... Well...

44:04.476 --> 44:05.894
Perhaps so.

44:07.479 --> 44:09.523
You'd be advised,
if it's not too late,

44:09.606 --> 44:11.358
not to fall in love with me.

44:12.151 --> 44:13.569
I have very little to offer

44:13.652 --> 44:15.487
in the way of constancy.

44:15.571 --> 44:16.780
Just adventure.

44:16.864 --> 44:17.990
I see.

44:19.575 --> 44:20.659
Let us sleep.

44:49.479 --> 44:50.480
Taxi, madam?

48:31.368 --> 48:32.369
Good evening...

48:34.079 --> 48:35.080
Duncan Wedderburn.

48:35.622 --> 48:37.666
Bella, where were you?
You disappeared.

48:38.375 --> 48:39.584
I did not.

48:40.335 --> 48:42.254
Nobody can just disappear.

48:42.838 --> 48:43.839
What?

48:43.922 --> 48:45.632
Can they? Disappear?

48:45.715 --> 48:46.842
No, of course not.

48:46.925 --> 48:48.677
What the fuck
are you talking...

48:48.760 --> 48:49.761
Where were you?

48:50.137 --> 48:53.723
I wanted a tart and then
an adventure befell me.

48:53.807 --> 48:56.726
I did not know how to return
and then I heard it.

48:56.810 --> 48:57.811
The tram.

48:57.894 --> 49:00.605
I will walk to the noise,
and I found it.

49:00.981 --> 49:02.399
Amazement to Bella.

49:02.482 --> 49:03.942
Explorer bloods in me.

49:04.526 --> 49:06.087
Bella, it's dangerous
to go out without me.

49:06.111 --> 49:07.112
I have adventured it

49:07.195 --> 49:09.489
and found nothing
but sugar and violence.

49:09.573 --> 49:11.158
It is most charming.

49:11.241 --> 49:12.325
I am fine.

49:12.993 --> 49:15.579
Now, I must lie down and
you must lie down on top of me

49:15.662 --> 49:16.955
and do more furious jumping.

49:21.126 --> 49:22.127
Kitty.

49:23.128 --> 49:25.589
Did you see the new show
in London by Wilde?

49:25.672 --> 49:26.965
Marvelously witty.

49:27.048 --> 49:28.341
I loved it.

49:28.425 --> 49:29.926
"A handbag."

49:34.556 --> 49:35.557
Bella.

49:36.933 --> 49:37.934
What?

49:39.269 --> 49:41.605
Why I keep it in my mouth
if it is revolting?

49:42.772 --> 49:44.816
I have said that before
to Gerald.

49:46.568 --> 49:49.237
- If you catch my drift.
- Uh...

49:49.946 --> 49:51.323
You are wicked.

49:51.406 --> 49:53.408
Oh. Because
you mean his penis.

49:55.827 --> 49:57.662
Duncan's can sometimes
be salty.

50:01.625 --> 50:02.667
Good God, Bella.

50:04.711 --> 50:06.213
I must go punch that baby.

50:10.967 --> 50:12.093
Bella.

50:16.723 --> 50:19.100
Your behavior
is unconscionable.

50:19.184 --> 50:20.393
Will you behave?

50:20.477 --> 50:22.729
The food
was cacking my throat,

50:22.812 --> 50:24.397
the baby annoying,

50:24.481 --> 50:26.691
and the woman
boring with words.

50:27.025 --> 50:28.151
You will rejoin the table

50:28.235 --> 50:30.987
and will confine yourself to
the following three phrases,

50:31.404 --> 50:33.448
"How marvelous!", "Delighted"

50:33.532 --> 50:37.118
and "How did they make
the pastry so crisp?" Yes?

50:37.827 --> 50:39.371
You are hurting Bella.

50:39.454 --> 50:40.789
Sorry.

50:40.872 --> 50:42.666
Reason does not penetrate.

50:42.749 --> 50:43.750
Let us go.

50:48.255 --> 50:49.256
Ow.

51:01.393 --> 51:03.853
Are you enjoying Lisbon,
Bella?

51:05.939 --> 51:06.940
Delighted.

51:09.109 --> 51:11.945
Kitty, how is
your dear father?

51:12.028 --> 51:13.029
He's very unwell.

51:13.780 --> 51:15.532
I fear he will not see
the year out.

51:15.615 --> 51:16.992
- Oh.
- How marvelous.

51:17.659 --> 51:19.619
How did they get
the pastry so crisp?

51:38.680 --> 51:39.848
Good God.

51:40.682 --> 51:41.766
What is it?

51:42.892 --> 51:43.935
From her.

51:47.314 --> 51:49.691
"Me good. Lisbon.

51:50.233 --> 51:53.194
"Sugar tart lick me all day."

51:54.738 --> 51:56.698
At least I hope that's
all one sentence, anyway.

51:56.781 --> 51:58.092
- Do you think they're...
- Fucking?

51:58.116 --> 51:59.117
Yes.

52:00.744 --> 52:01.953
Also,

52:02.037 --> 52:03.413
fellating a tram.

53:16.236 --> 53:19.572
Does your head ache too,
Duncan Wedderburn?

53:19.656 --> 53:22.200
And I also am starving
for dinner.

53:22.283 --> 53:23.868
Where the fuck were you?

53:27.205 --> 53:28.998
Victoria Blessington?

53:30.500 --> 53:32.377
I haven't seen you for years.

53:32.460 --> 53:34.295
And you still have not,

53:34.379 --> 53:36.923
as I am Bella Baxter,

53:37.006 --> 53:38.717
strange feathered lady.

53:38.800 --> 53:41.636
I apologize.
I could've sworn you were she.

53:42.971 --> 53:43.972
Hmm.

53:46.641 --> 53:47.726
Right.

53:47.809 --> 53:49.018
Shall we?

53:50.228 --> 53:52.522
The steak, the fish,

53:52.605 --> 53:54.816
little caramel things in pots

53:54.899 --> 53:57.402
that old spotted people
over there have.

53:57.485 --> 53:59.112
I don't want caramel in pots.

53:59.529 --> 54:01.740
Of course not.
That was all for Bella.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.324
Order at your whim.

54:04.743 --> 54:07.954
You are cross at Bella's
outings and adventures.

54:08.037 --> 54:10.290
And yet
we must discover by whim,

54:10.373 --> 54:13.376
as spoken by Duncan Wedderburn
to Bella Baxter,

54:13.460 --> 54:14.919
day one of Lisbon love affair.

54:15.503 --> 54:16.504
Touché.

54:16.838 --> 54:18.965
Understand me never lived
outside God's house.

54:19.048 --> 54:20.049
What?

54:20.133 --> 54:22.510
So, Bella so much to discover,

54:22.594 --> 54:24.721
and your sad face

54:25.221 --> 54:28.224
makes me discover
angry feelings for you.

54:29.976 --> 54:30.977
Right.

54:33.021 --> 54:34.373
I have become
the very thing I hate,

54:34.397 --> 54:36.733
a grasping succubus
of a lover.

54:38.485 --> 54:40.779
I've pried many of them off me
and now I'm it.

54:41.362 --> 54:42.363
Fuck!

55:49.764 --> 55:52.767
You, like me, are a creature
of freedom in the moments.

55:55.812 --> 55:57.052
What do you keep
doing that for?

55:58.147 --> 56:00.400
A man over there
repeated blinks at me.

56:01.234 --> 56:02.610
I blink back.

56:02.694 --> 56:04.195
For polites, I think.

56:16.374 --> 56:19.043
We are going to dance in town.
Please join us.

56:19.419 --> 56:21.296
I have never danced in town.

56:34.017 --> 56:35.602
- Duncan!
- Can't!

56:49.741 --> 56:50.742
You're quite mad.

56:50.825 --> 56:53.828
Stop talking as your sounds
make Bella angry!

56:53.912 --> 56:55.204
I will not stop talking.

56:55.288 --> 56:56.473
If I have something
to say, I'll...

56:56.497 --> 56:58.416
Ouch.

57:05.340 --> 57:06.341
All right.

57:10.011 --> 57:11.012
What's this?

57:12.513 --> 57:13.514
Oh.

57:14.432 --> 57:16.809
A man was teaching me chess,

57:16.893 --> 57:18.978
and he said he thought
I would probably have

57:19.062 --> 57:21.606
the softest skin
he had ever touched.

57:21.689 --> 57:23.441
And I said, if I did,

57:23.524 --> 57:26.194
it would be
the inner thighs to test,

57:26.277 --> 57:29.530
as that is where the epidermis
is at its most fine.

57:29.614 --> 57:30.657
So we tested,

57:31.115 --> 57:32.909
and it was the softest ever.

57:33.743 --> 57:36.996
I wondered if perhaps they're
not equal in softitude.

57:37.372 --> 57:38.748
Indeed they were not.

57:38.831 --> 57:42.335
So I made sure to note it,
remembering which was which.

57:48.216 --> 57:51.427
What of the tongue play
you were about to perform?

57:55.431 --> 57:57.016
Is that not happening?

58:15.201 --> 58:16.244
You...

58:18.788 --> 58:20.039
You are troubled.

58:21.582 --> 58:22.792
Did he lie with you?

58:23.626 --> 58:25.253
No, we were against a wall.

58:26.295 --> 58:27.755
Did you furious jump him?

58:27.839 --> 58:28.965
No...

58:29.048 --> 58:31.342
...he just fast-licked
my clitoris.

58:31.426 --> 58:33.302
I had the heat
that needed release,

58:33.386 --> 58:35.179
so at my request, it was.

58:38.516 --> 58:40.768
You, too, may tongue play me,

58:40.852 --> 58:45.690
so I'm not understanding
this complicated feeling.

58:48.943 --> 58:50.486
Are you now crying?

58:58.995 --> 59:02.832
What a confusing person
you are, Duncan Wedderburn.

59:03.166 --> 59:04.417
A liver.

59:12.884 --> 59:16.637
Mm. A small incision

59:17.263 --> 59:20.433
is all that is needed.

59:34.363 --> 59:36.324
I was chloroforming goats
all morning.

59:36.407 --> 59:38.993
I may have ingested too much.

59:39.077 --> 59:41.079
I am going to venture
to suggest

59:41.162 --> 59:43.998
you are upset
by Bella's absence.

59:44.082 --> 59:45.792
The liters of port,

59:45.875 --> 59:47.460
the sobbing I hear at night.

59:47.543 --> 59:50.588
Good God, man!
You prattle like an imbecile.

59:50.671 --> 59:52.006
She is gone!

59:53.382 --> 59:55.301
I am a man of science.

59:55.384 --> 59:58.596
I just need to engage in,
and continue, the project.

59:58.679 --> 01:00:01.766
That is all. I must go on
to the next thing.

01:00:01.849 --> 01:00:04.227
Our feelings
must be put aside.

01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:07.939
Do you think my father
could have branded me

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:10.775
with hot irons on the genitals
the way he did

01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:13.861
if he could not put
science and progress first?

01:00:13.945 --> 01:00:14.946
Branded you?

01:00:17.532 --> 01:00:19.659
Let us find a body.

01:00:21.035 --> 01:00:22.245
A... A what?

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:46.602
Hello. Good morning.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:50.773
Good morning, darling.

01:00:55.194 --> 01:00:58.406
I haven't been very supportive
of your adventurous spirit.

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:00.199
So I have a surprise for you.

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:09.750
Get in.

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:27.018
- We changed hotels?
- Look out the window, Bella.

01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:40.698
- We're on boat?
- Indeed.

01:01:41.908 --> 01:01:43.367
You aim to trap Bella at sea.

01:01:43.451 --> 01:01:46.162
I aim to give you
a new adventure.

01:01:46.245 --> 01:01:48.915
I suppose it's true
you'll be easier to find.

01:01:48.998 --> 01:01:51.542
Come, disrobe me.

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:52.668
Ride me.

01:01:53.586 --> 01:01:56.047
And we'll then have
cocktails on foredeck.

01:02:14.982 --> 01:02:16.025
Bella.

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:21.530
Bella.

01:02:24.784 --> 01:02:26.619
Bella.

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:28.621
Bella!

01:02:29.622 --> 01:02:32.124
Blue. Blue. Blue.

01:04:11.432 --> 01:04:13.192
Shit on me?

01:04:13.267 --> 01:04:14.685
Fucker!

01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:19.565
Madam.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.860
When do we stop?

01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:26.238
Athens. Three days.

01:04:54.517 --> 01:04:56.519
That woman's on fire, look.

01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:01.023
I know you're upset with me.

01:05:01.107 --> 01:05:04.026
Forgive my kidnapping of you,
but it was for love.

01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:06.404
A romantic jape.
Don't be such a cunt about it.

01:05:07.446 --> 01:05:09.949
- I want a drink.
- Of course, my darling.

01:05:10.032 --> 01:05:13.285
The ship is fun,
a whole world to explore.

01:05:14.203 --> 01:05:15.996
Do you love me? I love you.

01:05:17.206 --> 01:05:19.375
Describe the elements
I should be looking for

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:21.293
within myself to be sure.

01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:23.879
You just feel it or not.

01:05:23.963 --> 01:05:27.591
So it is no evidence base,
as God would say.

01:05:28.342 --> 01:05:29.885
So how judge it empirically?

01:05:29.969 --> 01:05:32.138
What the fuck are you
talking about? Who are you?

01:05:32.221 --> 01:05:33.764
You don't know
what bananas are,

01:05:33.848 --> 01:05:34.974
You've never heard of chess,

01:05:35.057 --> 01:05:36.767
and Yet you know
what "empiricallY" means.

01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:39.520
Bella wants a drink.
I said twice now.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.148
I've never felt
anything like this.

01:05:42.231 --> 01:05:43.607
Is this true for you?

01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:47.361
I suppose, empirically it is.

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:52.867
I'm out of ink.

01:05:53.242 --> 01:05:54.243
Oh.

01:05:57.830 --> 01:05:59.290
Then ink you shall have,
my love.

01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:15.097
Hello,
interesting older lady.

01:06:15.181 --> 01:06:16.807
I must touch Your hair.

01:06:19.268 --> 01:06:21.020
I also noticed your hair.

01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:25.107
Just like silk on
a translucent, glowing egg.

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:28.152
That is fancy words
that excite me somehow.

01:06:28.486 --> 01:06:31.155
I saw you're with
handsome over there.

01:06:31.238 --> 01:06:33.449
White teeth and a hard cock.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.118
Duncan Wedderburn.

01:06:36.202 --> 01:06:39.622
His teeth are also hard.
His penis is also white.

01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:41.624
- Good lay, I hope.
- He is mY only.

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:44.877
But I find him to elicit
exceptional sensations

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.589
throughout my whole bodY
that leave me yelping happily.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:52.593
I also wish to dash his body,
form, cadaver, into the sea.

01:06:53.219 --> 01:06:54.512
Is this man
jumping on your bodY?

01:06:54.595 --> 01:06:56.430
No, he is not.

01:06:56.514 --> 01:06:58.599
I haven't been bedded
in 20 years.

01:06:58.682 --> 01:06:59.767
What?

01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:01.560
That is terrible.

01:07:01.644 --> 01:07:03.562
It doesn't concern me greatly.

01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:05.856
As years have passed,

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:08.526
what's in between my ears
is my big concern.

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:11.111
What's in between my legs...

01:07:12.613 --> 01:07:13.656
much less so.

01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:16.075
A desperate rationalization,
Martha.

01:07:16.492 --> 01:07:18.452
Oh, this is Harry Astley.

01:07:18.536 --> 01:07:21.664
Don't take what he says
too much to heart.

01:07:22.164 --> 01:07:23.249
He's a cYnic.

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:24.917
Madam.

01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:27.044
I am Bella Baxter.

01:07:28.003 --> 01:07:30.506
I do not know
what this "cynic" is.

01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:31.924
Bella.

01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:33.008
Ink.

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:37.179
Duncan Wedderburn, I have made
friends, colleagues, comrades.

01:07:37.263 --> 01:07:38.806
Harry Astley.

01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:40.474
This is Martha.

01:07:40.558 --> 01:07:43.769
She is my new friend who has
not been fucked in 20 years.

01:07:43.852 --> 01:07:45.521
Is that not astonishment?

01:07:45.604 --> 01:07:47.731
I hope you use your hand
between your legs

01:07:47.815 --> 01:07:49.417
to keep Yourself happy.

01:07:49.441 --> 01:07:52.903
Good God, Bella,
you cannot speak like this.

01:07:52.987 --> 01:07:55.072
Polites of societY. I forgot.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:56.657
Polite society

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:59.159
- will destroY you.
- It will?

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:00.679
Yeah, there...
there's some truth to that.

01:08:00.703 --> 01:08:02.538
We all agreed on that.

01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:04.999
As to your enquiry on mY hand.

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:07.001
OccasionallY, yes.

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:09.461
That is much reassuring news.

01:08:10.296 --> 01:08:12.798
- We shall all dine together.
- Well, actually...

01:08:13.299 --> 01:08:15.593
We are all on a ship
and cannot escape,

01:08:15.676 --> 01:08:18.721
and there is a world to enjoy,
traverse, circumnavigate.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.765
Or can she not have friends,
Mr. Wedderburn?

01:08:22.433 --> 01:08:24.018
Delighted.

01:08:27.187 --> 01:08:28.480
Marry me.

01:08:28.564 --> 01:08:29.565
What?

01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:31.025
I meant to throw you aside.

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:33.777
A few months and send you
packing, but I cannot.

01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:34.862
SaY you'll marry me.

01:08:34.945 --> 01:08:36.822
No one's ever captured
my heart. You have.

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:39.241
It is tricky,

01:08:39.325 --> 01:08:41.785
as I am engaged
to Mr. Max McCandles.

01:08:43.078 --> 01:08:44.079
What?

01:08:44.622 --> 01:08:47.124
MY hand has taken by another.

01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:50.753
It is a saying I heard,
but did not understand.

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:54.173
You do not take just the hand,
but all, do you not?

01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:56.925
You ran away with me from him.

01:08:57.009 --> 01:08:58.135
A recounting of events,

01:08:58.218 --> 01:09:00.304
the point of which
is elusive to me.

01:09:00.387 --> 01:09:01.680
You chose me over him.

01:09:02.014 --> 01:09:03.474
For now.

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:04.683
For fun.

01:09:04.767 --> 01:09:07.519
I'll fucking throw you
overboard!

01:09:07.603 --> 01:09:10.564
So you wish to marry me
or kill me?

01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:13.400
- Is that the proposal?
- No.

01:09:29.458 --> 01:09:30.876
Going to the casino.

01:09:41.762 --> 01:09:43.347
Uh, that's fine.

01:09:44.098 --> 01:09:45.265
She is coming along.

01:09:45.683 --> 01:09:47.059
Let's try again.

01:09:47.559 --> 01:09:51.063
Gross motor skills
will develop slowly,

01:09:51.563 --> 01:09:53.982
but you will progress fast.

01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:56.985
FelicitY.

01:10:01.156 --> 01:10:02.157
Not that fast.

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:16.004
I am reading Emerson.

01:10:16.088 --> 01:10:18.465
He speaks about
the improvement of men.

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:21.760
I do not know why he does
not give advice to women.

01:10:21.844 --> 01:10:23.512
Perhaps he does not know anY.

01:10:24.555 --> 01:10:27.349
TrY and read Goethe.

01:10:27.433 --> 01:10:30.060
Philosophy is a waste of time,
Bella.

01:10:30.144 --> 01:10:32.438
Really? Say more.

01:10:32.521 --> 01:10:34.440
No, no, Harry, you wretch.

01:10:34.523 --> 01:10:35.524
It is integral.

01:10:36.608 --> 01:10:39.653
People and society
can be improved.

01:10:40.696 --> 01:10:42.698
It is the goal of all
to improve,

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:44.491
advance, progress, grow.

01:10:45.451 --> 01:10:46.452
I know this in me,

01:10:46.535 --> 01:10:48.203
and I am sure
I am indicative of all.

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:52.332
Trust me, you are definitely
unique, Bella, in all ways.

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:56.086
But this improvement
through philosophy

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.504
is people trying to run away

01:10:57.588 --> 01:11:00.257
from the fact
that we are all cruel beasts.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.676
Born that way, die that waY.

01:11:03.761 --> 01:11:05.512
It is a dark view of things,
Harry.

01:11:05.888 --> 01:11:06.889
Bella...

01:11:08.182 --> 01:11:09.600
let us take the air...

01:11:11.018 --> 01:11:12.770
in our cabin.

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:14.605
But these two are fighting,

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:17.566
and ideas are banging around
in Bella's head and heart

01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:19.318
like lights in a storm.

01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:20.611
Oh.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:24.323
You're always
reading now, Bella.

01:11:24.907 --> 01:11:28.494
You're losing some of
your adorable way of speaking.

01:11:28.577 --> 01:11:30.245
I am
a changingable feast,

01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:31.705
as are all of we.

01:11:31.789 --> 01:11:33.540
Apparently
according to Emerson,

01:11:33.624 --> 01:11:34.708
disagreed with by Harry.

01:11:34.792 --> 01:11:36.126
Come, come. Just come.

01:11:37.795 --> 01:11:39.421
You are in my sun.

01:11:39.797 --> 01:11:41.048
What?

01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:20.879
Come.

01:12:22.089 --> 01:12:24.383
Mm-mm. Busy drinking heavily.

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.222
Busy losing heavily.

01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:11.054
I must go meet Martha.

01:13:12.848 --> 01:13:14.099
Martha.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:16.602
She is the problem.

01:13:17.144 --> 01:13:20.814
I'll throw that perfumed bag
of flesh overboard.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.025
I dare you.

01:13:33.493 --> 01:13:34.912
Martha!

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:37.497
Where is she?

01:13:37.581 --> 01:13:39.166
Where are you, fuck.

01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:40.709
Where is she?

01:13:41.668 --> 01:13:44.630
- Where are you going?
- She's going over the side.

01:13:44.713 --> 01:13:45.923
Oh, marvelous!

01:13:46.006 --> 01:13:48.133
I never imagined
being murdered.

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:49.217
How dramatic.

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:51.136
Well, she seems happy to die.

01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:52.638
I'm sorry
for getting in your way.

01:13:53.931 --> 01:13:55.241
Oh!

01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:56.892
Oh!

01:13:57.684 --> 01:13:59.895
Exciting.

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:03.732
Oh... Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:05.984
Oh! Ooh, ooh.

01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:09.988
Oh. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:11.990
Hyah.

01:14:17.746 --> 01:14:19.206
I'll be in the bar.

01:14:53.073 --> 01:14:55.659
You have
made me think, cogitate,

01:14:56.576 --> 01:14:59.454
perambulate on ideas
that are wrong,

01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:02.708
erroneous
and nonsensically annoying

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:04.710
that lead me not to sleep.

01:15:04.793 --> 01:15:05.877
So...

01:15:07.796 --> 01:15:10.007
You say all are cruel.

01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:12.718
And I disagree, disavow,

01:15:12.801 --> 01:15:13.885
and say no not.

01:15:15.137 --> 01:15:17.222
But when with Duncan,

01:15:17.305 --> 01:15:19.808
the cruel
just bubbles up in me.

01:15:20.267 --> 01:15:21.768
That shows good judgment.

01:15:22.769 --> 01:15:24.229
He is a pretty moron.

01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:25.397
No.

01:15:26.064 --> 01:15:27.691
I do not wish to be cruel.

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:31.486
I must improve
this aspect of myself.

01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.238
You don't know the world.

01:15:33.822 --> 01:15:34.865
And you fear it.

01:15:37.325 --> 01:15:38.869
I do not fear it.

01:15:39.327 --> 01:15:41.496
Do you want to see
what the world is really like?

01:15:41.913 --> 01:15:42.914
I'll show you.

01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:44.666
Yes.

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:46.334
Of course.

01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:34.257
Do you hear that?

01:16:37.886 --> 01:16:38.887
What is it?

01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:02.244
- Lot of dead babies.
- Oh.

01:17:02.828 --> 01:17:04.037
Must be hot.

01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:07.207
We must go help them.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.626
How will we do that?

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.797
We go down there,

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.509
they'll quite rightfullY
rope us, rob us, and rape us.

01:17:17.592 --> 01:17:19.803
And if they were here
and we were there,

01:17:20.428 --> 01:17:21.805
we'd do the same to them.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:27.310
Bella.

01:17:28.186 --> 01:17:29.187
Bella.

01:17:30.147 --> 01:17:32.274
Bella.

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.043
We are casting off, ma'am.

01:19:15.543 --> 01:19:17.045
But I have to go back.

01:19:18.129 --> 01:19:21.925
I... I must give this money
to the poor near the hotel,

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:23.635
in what they call a slum.

01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:26.304
We're staying ashore, ma'am.

01:19:27.264 --> 01:19:28.723
We could take care
of that for you.

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:31.226
- You can?
- Of course.

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:33.436
It is generous of you.

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.105
They need moneY.

01:19:35.605 --> 01:19:36.815
Everyone does.

01:19:42.487 --> 01:19:43.530
Thank you.

01:20:00.714 --> 01:20:02.424
You! Get me the captain.

01:20:02.507 --> 01:20:04.134
Now we'll find
this fucking thief.

01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:05.218
Bella!

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:07.971
We've been robbed!

01:20:08.888 --> 01:20:10.223
I... I won.

01:20:10.307 --> 01:20:11.850
I won everything

01:20:11.933 --> 01:20:13.476
like never before.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.812
And now it's gone.

01:20:15.895 --> 01:20:17.689
You've not been robbed.

01:20:17.772 --> 01:20:19.607
- I took it.
- For what?

01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:21.234
I took it.

01:20:23.153 --> 01:20:24.446
I'm so tired.

01:20:26.448 --> 01:20:28.742
Or maybe just my spirit is.

01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:32.245
My soul has been buckled,
crumpled,

01:20:32.746 --> 01:20:35.290
flattened, Duncan Wedderburn,

01:20:36.082 --> 01:20:37.667
by the sights I have seen.

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.189
So, no need
for the captain then, sir?

01:20:42.213 --> 01:20:43.691
Fuck off before
I break all your teeth.

01:20:45.759 --> 01:20:46.885
Indeed, sir.

01:20:50.597 --> 01:20:51.639
Where is it?

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:53.975
You hid it for safetY.

01:20:54.059 --> 01:20:56.353
I was drunk and foolishly
left it everywhere.

01:20:56.436 --> 01:20:57.437
What a relief.

01:20:58.146 --> 01:20:59.898
I did not hide it.

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:04.069
I gave it to those poor people
out there.

01:21:04.652 --> 01:21:07.781
Money is its own form
of sickness,

01:21:08.323 --> 01:21:09.949
and all the scarcity of it.

01:21:11.409 --> 01:21:12.911
And who am I,

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:15.580
lying in a feather bed,

01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:18.333
while dead babies

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:20.293
lie in a ditch?

01:21:22.253 --> 01:21:23.296
Duncan.

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:26.841
You what?

01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:31.513
I am expecting
a hug of solace.

01:21:32.389 --> 01:21:33.390
You...

01:21:33.473 --> 01:21:36.059
I need to offer something
to the world.

01:21:37.018 --> 01:21:38.478
And yet I have nothing.

01:21:39.813 --> 01:21:41.022
Except some money.

01:21:42.982 --> 01:21:45.735
It is a bad day
for Bella Baxter.

01:21:46.861 --> 01:21:50.115
Where is my fucking money?

01:21:50.198 --> 01:21:51.491
I just told you.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:54.327
I gave it away to the poor.

01:21:56.079 --> 01:21:58.081
I thought
I told you to fuck off!

01:21:58.164 --> 01:22:00.542
The steward informs me

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.293
that you may not have
sufficient funds

01:22:02.377 --> 01:22:03.670
to make good
Your account, sir.

01:22:04.379 --> 01:22:06.099
- Well, I...
- That is probably true.

01:22:07.006 --> 01:22:08.925
I gave it all to some nice men

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:11.302
to pass on

01:22:11.845 --> 01:22:13.847
to the slum poor.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:16.141
You'll be put ashore
at the next port

01:22:16.224 --> 01:22:18.685
and confined to crew's rations
until then, sir.

01:22:18.768 --> 01:22:20.520
- Good evening.
- How dare you?

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:35.076
"Dead, blind babies

01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:37.871
"bit Harry.

01:22:39.706 --> 01:22:41.458
"My mouth

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:44.919
"was full of blood."

01:22:46.296 --> 01:22:47.422
Poor Bella.

01:22:49.257 --> 01:22:50.550
She is a ruin.

01:22:55.722 --> 01:22:57.474
- How's your hand?
- It's fine.

01:22:58.016 --> 01:22:59.142
I'm sorry.

01:22:59.225 --> 01:23:01.019
You were trying
to help me understand.

01:23:01.102 --> 01:23:03.646
No. I actually
wanted to hurt you.

01:23:04.856 --> 01:23:05.857
Couldn't bear to see

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:08.860
such dumb, beautiful happiness
in someone.

01:23:09.402 --> 01:23:10.612
It was cruel of me.

01:23:11.321 --> 01:23:12.489
I am not sorry.

01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:15.283
If I know the world,
I can improve it.

01:23:15.366 --> 01:23:16.493
You can't.

01:23:16.993 --> 01:23:18.411
That is the real point.

01:23:19.037 --> 01:23:20.622
Don't accept the lie
of religion,

01:23:20.705 --> 01:23:21.706
socialism,

01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:23.374
capitalism.

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.502
We are a fucked species.

01:23:25.585 --> 01:23:27.962
Know it. Hope is smashable.

01:23:28.046 --> 01:23:29.255
Realism is not.

01:23:29.756 --> 01:23:31.466
Protect yourself
with the truth.

01:23:33.259 --> 01:23:35.386
I realize
what you are now, Harry.

01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:36.638
Just a broken little boy

01:23:36.721 --> 01:23:38.598
who cannot bear
the pain of the world.

01:23:40.558 --> 01:23:41.684
I suppose so.

01:23:50.902 --> 01:23:52.028
Goodbye, Harry.

01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:53.947
We get thrown off
in Marseille.

01:23:54.781 --> 01:23:56.241
WhY do you stay with him?

01:23:56.866 --> 01:23:58.368
I always think
it will be better.

01:24:00.286 --> 01:24:01.412
'Course you do.

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:20.515
I have heard great things
of the beauty of Paris.

01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:26.479
I'll fucking kick
Your dog to death.

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:30.900
Fucking...

01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:33.027
Paris with no money.

01:24:33.528 --> 01:24:35.196
What do you suggest
we do, Bella?

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.531
I will get us a hotel.

01:24:36.614 --> 01:24:37.657
Do not worry.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.867
Uh-huh. With what?
We have no money.

01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:44.289
Is it not
an interesting experiment?

01:24:44.372 --> 01:24:45.373
We have nothing.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.001
- How will we live now?
- I don't know!

01:24:48.084 --> 01:24:50.003
Exactly,
that is the experiment.

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:51.629
We are now the poor.

01:24:52.839 --> 01:24:55.216
Also, many adventurers
have faced these odds.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.135
Robinson Crusoe, for example.

01:24:57.719 --> 01:25:00.263
Selfish, thoughtless,
careless bitch.

01:25:00.346 --> 01:25:02.724
I'm not thoughtless, Duncan.

01:25:03.349 --> 01:25:04.767
And while it is true
my ability

01:25:04.851 --> 01:25:08.021
to think things through to
the logical conclusions is not

01:25:08.646 --> 01:25:09.772
strong,

01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:12.233
I did help
those suffering people.

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:13.651
I have ruined us,

01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:15.361
as you pointed out,

01:25:15.903 --> 01:25:18.156
but I do believe my actions
come from a good place.

01:25:18.239 --> 01:25:20.408
Shut the fuck up.

01:25:21.326 --> 01:25:22.660
I will get us a hotel.

01:25:28.041 --> 01:25:29.542
Good afternoon, madam.

01:25:29.626 --> 01:25:32.754
Good day, my fresh,
darling English Rose.

01:25:33.755 --> 01:25:34.756
Is this a hotel?

01:25:34.839 --> 01:25:36.090
We have rooms.

01:25:36.591 --> 01:25:37.759
Are You looking for work?

01:25:37.842 --> 01:25:39.093
How much is a room?

01:25:39.177 --> 01:25:41.346
I'll charge you
10 francs an hour.

01:25:41.429 --> 01:25:43.556
You charge them 30.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.766
Everyone's happy.

01:25:45.391 --> 01:25:46.392
I see.

01:25:46.893 --> 01:25:48.311
<i>Monsieur</i> Chapelle.

01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:49.479
Fresh from London.

01:25:50.647 --> 01:25:52.023
<i>Enchanté.</i> Hello.

01:25:55.902 --> 01:25:57.028
<i>Merci.</i>

01:25:58.237 --> 01:25:59.405
So, off you go.

01:25:59.906 --> 01:26:01.407
At this point, I am confused.

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:03.326
You're not here to work?

01:26:03.409 --> 01:26:04.661
Oh, come on.

01:26:04.744 --> 01:26:07.288
Lie with him,
let him cock you a bit

01:26:07.372 --> 01:26:08.790
and make some nice francs.

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:10.166
I see.

01:26:10.792 --> 01:26:12.043
He would paY me for this?

01:26:12.585 --> 01:26:13.586
Yes.

01:26:14.128 --> 01:26:15.672
If you need money,

01:26:15.755 --> 01:26:17.840
it is the shortest route
to it.

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:21.719
I have never been cocked
by another man,

01:26:22.387 --> 01:26:23.846
and yet have wondered on that.

01:26:24.764 --> 01:26:26.140
And am in need of funds.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.104
It is, I believe,
a confluence of circumstances

01:26:31.187 --> 01:26:33.189
I regard as almost fate-like.

01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:34.982
Let us do this.

01:26:37.694 --> 01:26:38.945
Room 16.

01:27:16.691 --> 01:27:17.775
What is your name?

01:27:25.867 --> 01:27:27.034
Mysterious.

01:27:54.812 --> 01:27:57.356
Should we warm me up
a bit...

01:27:57.982 --> 01:27:59.108
Oh.

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:22.465
<i>Merci.</i>

01:28:29.347 --> 01:28:30.348
Good day, sir.

01:28:30.848 --> 01:28:32.308
<i>Éclair au chocolat?</i>

01:28:33.684 --> 01:28:36.187
I've come into some moneY
and some enlightenment.

01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:38.105
You stole it?

01:28:38.564 --> 01:28:41.317
You've always said you're
the best bedman in the world,

01:28:41.734 --> 01:28:43.110
and I have never
known another,

01:28:43.194 --> 01:28:45.321
so I knew not
whether this was true.

01:28:45.905 --> 01:28:47.114
But now I do.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:48.991
And he was terrible

01:28:49.450 --> 01:28:52.578
and made ungodly noises
as he thrust himself into me.

01:28:52.662 --> 01:28:55.039
And a mere three thrusts,
Duncan Wedderburn,

01:28:55.122 --> 01:28:56.290
was all he could manage.

01:28:56.624 --> 01:28:58.000
I stifled a laugh,

01:28:58.084 --> 01:29:00.002
out of polites, of course.

01:29:00.086 --> 01:29:02.213
I took his moneY.
I thanked him.

01:29:02.296 --> 01:29:04.799
I laughed all the way
to buy us these éclairs,

01:29:04.882 --> 01:29:05.967
and I thought so fondly,

01:29:06.884 --> 01:29:09.554
remembering the fierce
sweaty nights of ours.

01:29:11.097 --> 01:29:12.682
You fucked for money?

01:29:13.057 --> 01:29:14.475
And as an experiment.

01:29:15.268 --> 01:29:17.103
And it is good
for our relationship

01:29:17.186 --> 01:29:19.355
as it gladdens my heart
toward you.

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:20.815
My heart has been a bit dim

01:29:20.898 --> 01:29:23.234
on your weepy,
sweary person lately.

01:29:25.069 --> 01:29:27.613
You are a monster.
A whore and a monster.

01:29:27.697 --> 01:29:29.198
A demon sent from hell

01:29:29.282 --> 01:29:30.992
to rip my spirit to shreds.

01:29:31.075 --> 01:29:33.995
To punish my tiny sins

01:29:34.078 --> 01:29:35.830
with a tsunami of destruction.

01:29:35.913 --> 01:29:37.707
To take my heart
and pull it like taffy

01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:38.791
to ruin me.

01:29:38.875 --> 01:29:40.751
I look at you, and I see
nothing but ugliness.

01:29:42.295 --> 01:29:45.339
That last bit was uncalled for
and makes no sense,

01:29:45.423 --> 01:29:48.134
as your odes to my beautY
have been boring

01:29:48.217 --> 01:29:49.260
but constant.

01:29:49.844 --> 01:29:52.096
And the simple act

01:29:52.179 --> 01:29:54.807
of letting a strange man
ride on me

01:29:54.891 --> 01:29:55.892
has erased all that?

01:29:58.269 --> 01:29:59.353
Fuck!

01:29:59.437 --> 01:30:01.480
You whored yourself.

01:30:02.023 --> 01:30:04.233
Which you are now going
to explain to me is bad.

01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:05.860
Can I never win with you?

01:30:05.943 --> 01:30:08.738
It is the worst thing
women can do.

01:30:10.156 --> 01:30:11.949
We should definitely
never marry.

01:30:12.825 --> 01:30:15.077
I am a flawed,
experimenting person

01:30:15.161 --> 01:30:18.039
and I will need a husband with
a more forgiving disposition.

01:30:18.664 --> 01:30:20.082
Cunt!

01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:21.751
I can now see
you are not that.

01:30:22.585 --> 01:30:23.961
Our adventure is clearly over.

01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:26.631
I shall book you
a passage back to London.

01:30:27.089 --> 01:30:28.507
You had moneY

01:30:29.216 --> 01:30:30.217
this whole time?

01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:31.677
It is God's money.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.846
For emergencies.

01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:36.349
It has been a fucking
emergency for weeks now!

01:30:36.432 --> 01:30:38.225
I believed in you
the whole time,

01:30:38.726 --> 01:30:40.353
that you would rise
to the occasion.

01:30:40.811 --> 01:30:42.355
But now I see
that was a mistake,

01:30:42.438 --> 01:30:44.190
and there's clearly
something broken in you.

01:30:44.273 --> 01:30:46.442
You broke
that something in me!

01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:48.945
I feel this conversation
has become circular.

01:30:49.028 --> 01:30:51.405
Cunt!

01:30:57.662 --> 01:31:00.081
Madam Swiney,
I have examined my situation.

01:31:00.164 --> 01:31:01.749
I need sex and money.

01:31:02.249 --> 01:31:03.542
I could take a lover,

01:31:03.626 --> 01:31:05.461
another Wedderburn
who would keep me

01:31:05.544 --> 01:31:07.713
but may require
an awful lot of attention.

01:31:07.797 --> 01:31:09.590
Or else
it's 20 minutes at a time,

01:31:09.674 --> 01:31:11.884
and the rest of my day
is free to study on the world

01:31:11.968 --> 01:31:13.135
and the improvement of it.

01:31:13.678 --> 01:31:16.097
Hence, I seek employment

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.890
at your musty-smelling
establishment

01:31:17.974 --> 01:31:19.100
of good-time fornication.

01:31:19.183 --> 01:31:22.228
A woman plotting
her course to freedom.

01:31:22.979 --> 01:31:24.438
How delightful.

01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:26.232
Come.

01:31:29.777 --> 01:31:31.988
Ah, <i>Monsieur</i> Saveur.

01:31:33.739 --> 01:31:34.782
A filet mignon.

01:31:35.366 --> 01:31:37.284
A prime cut.

01:31:37.618 --> 01:31:38.661
<i>Merci.</i>

01:31:50.339 --> 01:31:51.590
Bella.

01:31:53.426 --> 01:31:55.011
Say <i>"formidable"</i> at the end.

01:31:55.094 --> 01:31:56.137
House rules.

01:32:25.124 --> 01:32:26.667
Is that smell you?

01:33:01.494 --> 01:33:02.578
<i>Formidable.</i>

01:33:03.412 --> 01:33:04.413
<i>Merci.</i>

01:33:15.549 --> 01:33:16.717
For the smell.

01:33:17.676 --> 01:33:19.678
And tea.
Just because tea is nice.

01:33:21.889 --> 01:33:22.890
<i>Merci.</i>

01:33:23.766 --> 01:33:24.975
It was brutal

01:33:25.476 --> 01:33:26.936
in a strangely
not unpleasant way.

01:33:31.065 --> 01:33:32.983
Pamphlet.

01:33:33.067 --> 01:33:34.693
- Read.
- What is that?

01:33:34.777 --> 01:33:35.778
<i>Une personne qui veut...</i>

01:33:35.861 --> 01:33:37.488
Change the world.

01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:39.448
Make it better.
A better world.

01:33:40.491 --> 01:33:42.201
Then I am that too.

01:33:53.337 --> 01:33:54.505
Madam SwineY,

01:33:54.588 --> 01:33:56.382
this lineup system,

01:33:56.465 --> 01:33:58.342
you really expect me
to go upstairs with a man

01:33:58.425 --> 01:34:00.052
even if I find him distasteful

01:34:00.427 --> 01:34:02.388
and therefore am sad

01:34:02.471 --> 01:34:03.931
when I let him
furious jump me?

01:34:04.014 --> 01:34:06.517
That is the way it is,
my darling.

01:34:09.603 --> 01:34:11.147
Gosh, you look pretty.

01:34:11.230 --> 01:34:13.399
How it agrees with you
to be ravaged.

01:34:14.275 --> 01:34:15.276
I suppose so.

01:34:15.776 --> 01:34:17.111
<i>Oui.</i>

01:34:17.194 --> 01:34:19.113
<i>Oui, monsieur Mersault.</i>
Bella.

01:34:20.197 --> 01:34:22.533
So, would you not prefer it
if the women chose,

01:34:22.992 --> 01:34:25.536
as it would be a sign
of enthusiasm toward you?

01:34:25.911 --> 01:34:27.663
Um, you wouldn't have
the vague sense

01:34:27.746 --> 01:34:29.081
that they are
in a state of horror

01:34:29.165 --> 01:34:30.166
when You jump them.

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:37.006
Bella is new
and may have a mental illness.

01:34:41.135 --> 01:34:42.636
As God, my father, says,

01:34:43.053 --> 01:34:45.806
it is only the way it is until
we discover the new way it is,

01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:47.033
and then that is the way it is

01:34:47.057 --> 01:34:48.601
until we discover
the new way it is,

01:34:48.684 --> 01:34:50.936
and so it goes until the world
is no longer flat,

01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:52.438
electricity lights the night,

01:34:52.521 --> 01:34:54.124
and shoes are no longer
tied with ribbons.

01:34:55.316 --> 01:34:57.116
As a socialist,
I agree entirely.

01:34:57.193 --> 01:34:58.194
<i>Formidable.</i>

01:34:58.277 --> 01:35:00.654
Toinette, you have such
a clever mouth.

01:35:01.197 --> 01:35:04.033
<i>Monsieur</i> Mersault
will enjoY it for free.

01:35:04.617 --> 01:35:06.202
Go. Now.

01:35:06.911 --> 01:35:09.330
Bella, a moment in my office.

01:35:11.457 --> 01:35:14.168
You have the most
delicious looking lobes.

01:35:15.252 --> 01:35:16.253
Thank you.

01:35:16.337 --> 01:35:17.421
I must...

01:35:20.633 --> 01:35:23.093
Oh, I am sorry. I drew blood.

01:35:23.928 --> 01:35:24.970
Here.

01:35:27.556 --> 01:35:29.683
I sometimes give in to myself

01:35:29.767 --> 01:35:31.852
when I see beauty,
young beautY.

01:35:31.936 --> 01:35:33.479
For one day, my dear,

01:35:33.562 --> 01:35:36.774
you will be a wrinkled,
old husk.

01:35:36.857 --> 01:35:39.276
And no one will want you
either to pay you for it

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.278
or to have it for free.

01:35:41.946 --> 01:35:44.615
I still believe everyone would
be happier if we could choose.

01:35:44.698 --> 01:35:46.200
An idealist.

01:35:46.575 --> 01:35:47.743
Like me.

01:35:48.202 --> 01:35:50.579
How delightful you are.

01:35:50.663 --> 01:35:53.332
But we must give in
to the demands

01:35:53.415 --> 01:35:55.000
of the world sometimes.

01:35:55.084 --> 01:35:56.877
Grapple with it,
try to defeat it.

01:35:56.961 --> 01:35:59.338
- So you believe as me?
- Of course.

01:35:59.421 --> 01:36:03.634
But some men enjoy
that you do not like it.

01:36:03.717 --> 01:36:04.718
What?

01:36:06.303 --> 01:36:07.471
- That is...
- Sick.

01:36:07.554 --> 01:36:09.306
But good business.

01:36:09.974 --> 01:36:11.225
Come with me.

01:36:16.230 --> 01:36:17.606
My grandchild.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.819
Sick and poorlY,
and requiring much doctoring.

01:36:21.902 --> 01:36:26.657
My choice of giving you choice
will jeopardize the business.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.450
Her health. Her life.

01:36:28.534 --> 01:36:30.953
- Do you want that, Bella?
- Of course not.

01:36:31.036 --> 01:36:32.830
You don't? You're so lovely.

01:36:34.999 --> 01:36:36.625
I thought you were going
for mY lobes.

01:36:38.585 --> 01:36:39.920
We must work.

01:36:40.879 --> 01:36:43.132
We must make money.

01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:46.552
But more than that,
we must experience everything,

01:36:46.635 --> 01:36:48.012
not just the good.

01:36:48.095 --> 01:36:51.348
But degradation,
horror, sadness...

01:36:51.432 --> 01:36:53.976
This makes us whole, Bella.

01:36:54.059 --> 01:36:56.270
Makes us people of substance,

01:36:56.353 --> 01:36:58.647
not flighty,
untouched children.

01:37:00.024 --> 01:37:01.775
Then we can know the world.

01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:04.862
And when we know the world,

01:37:05.279 --> 01:37:07.114
the world is ours.

01:37:08.115 --> 01:37:09.241
I want that.

01:37:09.992 --> 01:37:11.535
Now,

01:37:11.618 --> 01:37:13.495
go and fuck someone

01:37:13.579 --> 01:37:15.956
and bring me 10 francs.

01:37:20.210 --> 01:37:22.588
First, I suggest a short quiz.

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:24.381
A quiz?

01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:26.842
You tell me
a childhood memory.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.097
Then I tell a joke.
<i>Toc toc.</i>

01:37:32.598 --> 01:37:34.308
Then a quick sniff,

01:37:34.391 --> 01:37:37.644
and if necessarY,
a quick douse in lavender oil.

01:37:37.728 --> 01:37:40.647
And all of this
will enhance the experience,

01:37:40.731 --> 01:37:42.232
making it <i>formidable.</i>

01:37:42.316 --> 01:37:43.317
<i>Toc toc.</i>

01:37:44.026 --> 01:37:45.027
<i>Toc toc.</i>

01:37:45.527 --> 01:37:47.363
<i>Non,</i> I tell the joke.

01:37:47.446 --> 01:37:48.697
You the memory.

01:37:49.531 --> 01:37:51.075
- Mm.
<i>- Le souvenir.</i>

01:37:58.916 --> 01:38:01.126
When you were
little in Greece,

01:38:01.210 --> 01:38:02.920
you fell from your bicycle?

01:38:03.003 --> 01:38:04.088
<i>Oui.</i>

01:38:05.881 --> 01:38:06.965
Mm.

01:38:09.676 --> 01:38:11.011
Blood.
Down my leg.

01:38:11.095 --> 01:38:12.096
Mm.

01:38:14.598 --> 01:38:16.558
<i>"Joie."</i> Joy?

01:38:16.642 --> 01:38:18.227
You watched the blood
with joy.

01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:20.020
<i>- Oui.</i>
- Knock, knock.

01:38:20.854 --> 01:38:22.439
<i>- Qui c'est?
- Fromage.</i>

01:38:22.773 --> 01:38:23.774
<i>Fromage qui?</i>

01:38:24.233 --> 01:38:25.442
Cheese to meet you.

01:38:36.203 --> 01:38:37.287
You know it.

01:38:41.625 --> 01:38:42.876
You smell okay.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:43.961
Let us fuck.

01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:31.967
God gave you a gift,
my friend.

01:40:12.799 --> 01:40:14.843
Very inelegant work.

01:40:15.219 --> 01:40:16.845
This is what You do
when you're homesick?

01:40:30.943 --> 01:40:32.903
You wish what?

01:40:33.278 --> 01:40:35.948
My boys are of an age
for education. Sexual.

01:40:37.616 --> 01:40:38.700
I will demonstrate.

01:40:39.535 --> 01:40:40.536
I see.

01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:49.211
At times.

01:41:03.892 --> 01:41:06.019
Shall I lay,
bend, astride?

01:41:06.895 --> 01:41:08.535
- Let's start simple, please.
- Mm.

01:41:42.848 --> 01:41:44.308
To aid things along,

01:41:44.391 --> 01:41:46.226
- a finger in the arse.
- No.

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:48.353
Or a slight choking maY do it.

01:42:16.298 --> 01:42:18.383
Go home!

01:42:25.223 --> 01:42:26.725
Bella!

01:42:27.893 --> 01:42:29.603
Madam SwineY was right.

01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:32.606
I am discovering parts
of myself hitherto unknown.

01:42:32.689 --> 01:42:34.232
It is a way to look at it.

01:42:34.983 --> 01:42:38.195
The variety of desires being
made manifest is fascinating.

01:42:38.278 --> 01:42:39.321
Have you had the man

01:42:39.404 --> 01:42:41.007
who puts a wedge of pineapple
in your mouth

01:42:41.031 --> 01:42:42.032
and covers you in dust?

01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:44.701
Bella.

01:42:45.911 --> 01:42:47.537
I'm almost ready
to forgive you.

01:42:47.704 --> 01:42:48.955
I've booked our berths home,

01:42:49.122 --> 01:42:51.667
and I've told Mother
to prepare our wedding bed.

01:42:52.793 --> 01:42:54.544
Did you fuck that guy
with hooks for hands?

01:42:54.711 --> 01:42:56.171
You did. I know!

01:42:56.922 --> 01:42:59.383
I beat the tar
out of that guy.

01:42:59.549 --> 01:43:01.426
Duncan. I thought you left.

01:43:01.593 --> 01:43:03.929
Back to the ship,
but started to ache and vomit,

01:43:04.262 --> 01:43:05.430
so I'm here to save you.

01:43:05.639 --> 01:43:06.807
Hello, Duncan.

01:43:10.102 --> 01:43:11.311
Go home, Duncan.

01:43:11.478 --> 01:43:12.938
Our time has ended.

01:43:13.105 --> 01:43:14.207
I look at you and feel nothing

01:43:14.231 --> 01:43:16.334
but the lingering question
of how did I ever want you?

01:43:16.358 --> 01:43:17.359
Oh...

01:43:17.442 --> 01:43:19.194
And we must go
to the meeting of socialists.

01:43:21.988 --> 01:43:23.281
You're whores.

01:43:23.365 --> 01:43:25.742
We are our own means
of production.

01:43:25.826 --> 01:43:26.910
Go away.

01:43:39.548 --> 01:43:40.549
Foot.

01:43:42.551 --> 01:43:43.885
Paint, foot.

01:43:43.969 --> 01:43:44.970
Very good.

01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:50.851
Language is slow
but improving.

01:43:50.934 --> 01:43:52.018
Paint. Foot.

01:43:52.102 --> 01:43:53.103
Genius.

01:43:53.979 --> 01:43:56.022
Can you not be
so cruel to her?

01:43:56.106 --> 01:43:57.649
I made a mistake with Bella.

01:43:57.733 --> 01:43:59.609
I allowed feelings to develop.

01:44:00.402 --> 01:44:01.611
There are none for her.

01:44:01.695 --> 01:44:04.114
She is no different
to the chicken dog.

01:44:04.197 --> 01:44:05.198
Foot.

01:44:05.282 --> 01:44:07.284
It is better
this way, perhaps,

01:44:07.367 --> 01:44:10.537
and gives some insight into
my father's coolness to me.

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:13.331
It was a necessitY of science.

01:44:13.415 --> 01:44:14.583
Good God, man.

01:44:14.666 --> 01:44:16.418
- Foot.
- I do not expect You

01:44:16.501 --> 01:44:18.628
to understand, village doctor.

01:44:19.963 --> 01:44:22.424
By the way,
I need you to operate on me.

01:44:22.966 --> 01:44:25.135
Shall I put a beating heart
in your monstrous form?

01:44:26.052 --> 01:44:27.304
If you have time

01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:29.389
while taking...

01:44:31.391 --> 01:44:32.476
this out.

01:44:50.035 --> 01:44:52.746
I'll remove some cYsts
from around the tumor.

01:44:52.829 --> 01:44:55.373
No need. You may close me up.

01:44:56.166 --> 01:44:58.752
It has spread.
I see tinY polyps.

01:45:01.963 --> 01:45:03.340
I am dying.

01:45:03.423 --> 01:45:06.218
How to break it
to the patient, eh?

01:45:06.635 --> 01:45:07.761
Baxter...

01:45:07.844 --> 01:45:08.929
Do not cry into the wound!

01:45:09.012 --> 01:45:10.680
You'll kill me faster
with sepsis.

01:45:11.306 --> 01:45:12.307
Quiet now.

01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:13.809
And close me up.

01:45:15.519 --> 01:45:16.895
Find her.

01:45:22.234 --> 01:45:23.819
I am closed.

01:45:31.076 --> 01:45:32.953
Hot chocolate,
my dear.

01:45:33.036 --> 01:45:35.121
And <i>pain au chocolat.</i>

01:45:43.588 --> 01:45:44.673
You are my favorite.

01:45:47.008 --> 01:45:49.636
I have heard you say that
to the others.

01:45:49.719 --> 01:45:51.471
We are a machine You feed

01:45:51.555 --> 01:45:53.223
with compliments
and chocolate.

01:45:53.306 --> 01:45:55.475
You are my children
I feed with love.

01:46:02.232 --> 01:46:05.151
Something terrible
has happened, Swiney.

01:46:05.777 --> 01:46:07.737
I feel almost nothing.

01:46:09.281 --> 01:46:12.492
My empathy is creeping
toward what I would describe

01:46:12.659 --> 01:46:14.786
as contemptuous rage.

01:46:14.953 --> 01:46:16.580
This is fabulous.

01:46:16.663 --> 01:46:17.664
It is?

01:46:20.667 --> 01:46:22.711
You're in the dark period.

01:46:23.587 --> 01:46:26.506
Before light and wisdom
come to you.

01:46:27.883 --> 01:46:29.718
You must forge through it,

01:46:30.635 --> 01:46:32.178
and once on the other side,

01:46:32.846 --> 01:46:34.598
you will be grateful
to this moment,

01:46:34.681 --> 01:46:36.850
but you must keep going.

01:46:36.933 --> 01:46:37.976
I see.

01:47:54.052 --> 01:47:55.470
You've got a baby scar.

01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:59.683
Mine is with <i>ma maman.</i>

01:48:01.977 --> 01:48:03.144
I don't have one.

01:48:04.562 --> 01:48:06.898
It is an accident scar.

01:48:06.982 --> 01:48:09.317
But you're not the first
to have made the mistake.

01:48:09.401 --> 01:48:10.485
Why lie?

01:48:11.444 --> 01:48:12.612
I'm not lying.

01:48:13.363 --> 01:48:15.115
MY Godwin told me himself.

01:48:33.049 --> 01:48:34.175
Wedderburn.

01:48:59.325 --> 01:49:00.452
Good day, sir.

01:49:04.914 --> 01:49:06.833
You wrote
to Mr. Godwin Baxter.

01:49:07.292 --> 01:49:09.461
He has sent a demon
at large into the world.

01:49:09.544 --> 01:49:11.588
The devil's wrapped
in an alluring body

01:49:11.671 --> 01:49:12.964
that cannot be satiated,

01:49:13.048 --> 01:49:16.217
and a mind that picks
people apart stitch by stitch

01:49:16.301 --> 01:49:18.386
like a bloodied
and burned rag doll

01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:19.763
shat out
of an elephant's arse.

01:49:19.846 --> 01:49:20.847
Bella.

01:49:21.598 --> 01:49:22.682
Where is she?

01:49:22.766 --> 01:49:23.808
Who are you?

01:49:23.892 --> 01:49:25.643
I'm her fiancé, sir.

01:49:29.814 --> 01:49:32.525
Obviously, things did not
end well between you.

01:49:32.609 --> 01:49:33.651
Did not?

01:49:34.444 --> 01:49:35.862
She destroYed me.

01:49:35.945 --> 01:49:38.782
Well, we're all masters
of our own ship, sir.

01:49:38.865 --> 01:49:39.866
There's that.

01:49:39.949 --> 01:49:43.244
I do not like you
or your words.

01:49:43.328 --> 01:49:44.662
That Godwin Baxter.

01:49:44.746 --> 01:49:46.831
He knew,
and he set her on to me.

01:49:46.915 --> 01:49:47.916
He trapped me.

01:49:49.834 --> 01:49:50.835
Where is she?

01:49:50.919 --> 01:49:53.671
Would not wish her
on my worst enemy.

01:49:55.590 --> 01:49:58.134
I shall save you
from her, sir.

01:50:11.773 --> 01:50:14.442
Forgive my frustration.
Just tell me.

01:50:14.526 --> 01:50:16.069
It does not hurt.

01:50:16.152 --> 01:50:18.488
I have no insides.

01:50:18.571 --> 01:50:20.448
She hollowed me out.

01:50:20.532 --> 01:50:22.909
My soul. My bank account!

01:50:23.451 --> 01:50:24.744
I am a bug! A shell!

01:50:24.911 --> 01:50:25.912
Shall we sing?

01:50:25.995 --> 01:50:28.331
<i>Oh, we are sailors...</i>

01:50:28.414 --> 01:50:30.166
It doesn't...

01:50:31.334 --> 01:50:32.752
Doesn't hurt.

01:50:34.879 --> 01:50:36.714
I do not wish it
to be like this.

01:50:38.091 --> 01:50:39.259
You force mY hand.

01:50:39.342 --> 01:50:41.970
"We're all masters
of our own ship."

01:50:42.053 --> 01:50:44.889
You cunting
cunt-faced deadshit.

01:50:45.348 --> 01:50:46.349
Please.

01:50:46.432 --> 01:50:48.184
I ask you
as politely as I can.

01:50:48.268 --> 01:50:50.186
Where is she?

01:51:02.657 --> 01:51:03.658
<i>Merci.</i>

01:51:46.576 --> 01:51:48.286
The whore is back.

01:51:53.499 --> 01:51:55.210
- God?
- Bella!

01:51:55.877 --> 01:51:57.378
Max wrote me.

01:51:57.837 --> 01:51:59.964
- You are ill?
- I am not. I am dying.

01:52:00.048 --> 01:52:01.049
A subtle difference,

01:52:01.132 --> 01:52:03.927
but one I take seriously
as a physician.

01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:05.720
You are a sight
and a good one.

01:52:05.803 --> 01:52:06.804
You cannot die.

01:52:06.888 --> 01:52:09.057
Empirical data says different.

01:52:10.308 --> 01:52:11.309
I m issed You.

01:52:12.644 --> 01:52:15.563
I now have to lie down.

01:52:21.778 --> 01:52:23.529
It is not all sunshine
I bring.

01:52:25.156 --> 01:52:27.867
I also bring beady eyes
and hard questions.

01:52:29.577 --> 01:52:31.079
Did I have a baby in me?

01:52:31.996 --> 01:52:33.206
And if so, where is it?

01:52:33.581 --> 01:52:34.666
I see.

01:52:35.625 --> 01:52:39.420
Well, technically,
you are your babY.

01:52:39.504 --> 01:52:42.298
And also, I suppose
you are your mother.

01:52:42.382 --> 01:52:44.300
And also neither.

01:52:44.384 --> 01:52:46.261
No memory survives.

01:52:46.344 --> 01:52:47.971
No experiences survive.

01:52:49.013 --> 01:52:51.057
What do you mean
I am mother and daughter?

01:53:09.242 --> 01:53:10.785
You knew and did not tell.

01:53:11.244 --> 01:53:14.038
I... did not see
good reason to.

01:53:14.122 --> 01:53:15.373
And were too cowardly to.

01:53:15.456 --> 01:53:17.125
A bit of that as well.

01:53:18.626 --> 01:53:20.128
I wanted to be with you,

01:53:20.628 --> 01:53:22.964
and I was not sure
you would even understand.

01:53:23.047 --> 01:53:26.551
And Baxter kind of makes one
a prisoner to him.

01:53:26.634 --> 01:53:27.885
And... And I am...

01:53:31.014 --> 01:53:32.015
I'm sorry.

01:53:43.026 --> 01:53:44.466
Bam.

01:53:45.194 --> 01:53:46.237
Bam.

01:53:47.363 --> 01:53:48.364
Bam.

01:53:49.532 --> 01:53:50.533
Bam.

01:53:51.701 --> 01:53:52.785
Bam.

01:53:53.745 --> 01:53:54.746
Bam.

01:53:55.997 --> 01:53:57.040
Bam.

01:53:57.123 --> 01:53:58.124
Who is this?

01:53:58.583 --> 01:54:01.210
<i>Bell whore
Bell whore</i>

01:54:01.294 --> 01:54:02.771
I see you've
introduced me then, Prim.

01:54:02.795 --> 01:54:04.589
- I like this one though.
<i>- Bell whore</i>

01:54:04.672 --> 01:54:05.733
That's enough now,
Felicity...

01:54:05.757 --> 01:54:07.258
<i>- Bell whore</i>
- Ah, f...

01:54:07.342 --> 01:54:08.343
Fucker.

01:54:09.719 --> 01:54:10.720
Another one?

01:54:11.637 --> 01:54:12.638
We missed you.

01:54:13.056 --> 01:54:14.390
Monsters.

01:54:16.184 --> 01:54:17.769
Oh, fucking hell.

01:54:17.852 --> 01:54:19.520
<i>Bell whore</i>

01:54:19.979 --> 01:54:21.564
<i>Bell whore</i>

01:54:59.352 --> 01:55:00.788
<i>It is hard
to be in the position</i>

01:55:00.812 --> 01:55:02.271
<i>where one wants to hit someone</i>

01:55:02.355 --> 01:55:04.399
<i>who is already
in obvious pain.</i>

01:55:04.482 --> 01:55:07.235
<i>It is a conundrum
for sure.</i>

01:55:09.028 --> 01:55:11.072
Would you rather be
a gray slab of flesh

01:55:11.155 --> 01:55:13.032
with a fishhook in your nose?

01:55:13.116 --> 01:55:16.077
I will feel good for a second,
but bad for longer, so...

01:55:17.537 --> 01:55:19.205
I really had a fishhook
in mY nose?

01:55:19.288 --> 01:55:20.832
You did.

01:55:22.542 --> 01:55:24.419
So, I am your creation...

01:55:26.295 --> 01:55:27.380
as is the other one.

01:55:27.463 --> 01:55:29.048
Neither of you are that.

01:55:29.132 --> 01:55:32.093
She wanders the halls
with a hammer and a song,

01:55:32.176 --> 01:55:33.719
and that is not my doing.

01:55:34.387 --> 01:55:36.639
And I read your cards
and letters home

01:55:36.722 --> 01:55:39.016
and watched you
fearlessly create Bella Baxter

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:40.101
with wonder.

01:55:40.184 --> 01:55:42.228
I am finding
being alive fascinating,

01:55:42.311 --> 01:55:44.021
so I'll forgive you the act,

01:55:44.856 --> 01:55:47.066
but always hate the lies
and trapping that followed.

01:55:48.067 --> 01:55:49.235
Understood.

01:55:54.699 --> 01:55:55.783
Good to see you.

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:57.493
You too.

01:55:58.744 --> 01:56:00.788
Anger, confusion,
and brain dissonance aside,

01:56:00.872 --> 01:56:01.873
I m issed You.

01:56:03.249 --> 01:56:05.376
I arrived home, and I smelled
the formaldehyde,

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:06.919
and I knew what is next.

01:56:09.630 --> 01:56:10.882
I will be a doctor.

01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:14.385
My surgery is yours.

01:56:16.262 --> 01:56:17.513
My father once told me,

01:56:18.806 --> 01:56:21.726
alwaYs carve with compassion.

01:56:21.809 --> 01:56:23.936
He was a fucking idiot.

01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:26.522
But it's not bad advice.

01:56:29.734 --> 01:56:31.360
He does not have long.

01:56:32.403 --> 01:56:33.529
I know.

01:56:34.906 --> 01:56:36.782
You've not mentioned
our betrothal.

01:56:36.866 --> 01:56:37.867
Um...

01:56:38.659 --> 01:56:40.578
You were much younger.

01:56:41.746 --> 01:56:43.122
There is no bind.

01:56:43.206 --> 01:56:46.209
I was mesmerized by you,
and Baxter took advantage.

01:56:46.292 --> 01:56:48.127
So, you are mesmerized
no more?

01:56:48.544 --> 01:56:51.339
I am still mesmerized.

01:56:51.964 --> 01:56:53.382
I've been a whore,
you understand?

01:56:53.758 --> 01:56:56.761
- Mm.
- Cocks for money inside me.

01:56:56.844 --> 01:56:57.970
You okay with that?

01:56:58.804 --> 01:57:01.140
Does the whoring thing
challenge the desire

01:57:01.224 --> 01:57:03.226
for ownership that men have?

01:57:03.309 --> 01:57:05.686
Wedderburn became
much weepy and swearY

01:57:05.770 --> 01:57:07.355
when he discovered my whoring.

01:57:08.022 --> 01:57:11.776
I find myself merely jealous
of the men's time with you

01:57:11.859 --> 01:57:14.987
rather than any moral
aspersion against you.

01:57:15.071 --> 01:57:16.656
It is your body, Bella Baxter.

01:57:17.073 --> 01:57:18.574
Yours to give freelY.

01:57:19.617 --> 01:57:21.077
I generally charged 30 francs.

01:57:21.577 --> 01:57:23.871
Well, that seems low.

01:57:25.081 --> 01:57:27.792
Do you believe
people improvable, Max?

01:57:27.875 --> 01:57:28.876
I do.

01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:31.879
Just as a human body
can be cured of illness,

01:57:31.963 --> 01:57:35.424
so can men and women
be cured of aspect.

01:57:37.635 --> 01:57:39.554
Will you marry me,
Max McCandles?

01:57:41.639 --> 01:57:42.640
I will.

01:57:50.064 --> 01:57:51.667
We will need less of
your tongue in the future,

01:57:51.691 --> 01:57:53.317
but overall, most agreeable.

01:57:53.401 --> 01:57:55.486
Mm. I...
I will take that note.

01:57:57.363 --> 01:58:00.616
And have You been checked
for, um, disease?

01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:02.493
I have not,
but I shall.

01:58:03.202 --> 01:58:05.371
I'm enjoying
this practical love we have.

01:58:06.747 --> 01:58:10.459
Um, but I... I assure you
mine is also passionate.

01:58:11.294 --> 01:58:12.628
You are adorable.

01:58:13.421 --> 01:58:14.589
You always were.

01:58:24.515 --> 01:58:25.850
God, you are walking.

01:58:25.933 --> 01:58:28.102
I have taken
five milligrams of heroin

01:58:28.185 --> 01:58:29.520
through the toes for pain,

01:58:29.604 --> 01:58:31.063
amphetamines for energy,

01:58:31.147 --> 01:58:34.859
and cocaine because
I am partial to cocaine.

01:58:34.942 --> 01:58:37.945
I've come here to walk you
down the aisle.

01:58:50.625 --> 01:58:53.461
And so, by the powers vested
in me by the church,

01:58:53.544 --> 01:58:55.379
I shall solemnize this union.

01:58:56.505 --> 01:59:00.343
Do you, Bella Baxter,
take this man as your husband?

01:59:00.426 --> 01:59:03.262
Did we miss the part about
anyone objecting to this?

01:59:03.929 --> 01:59:05.431
Or has that been removed

01:59:05.514 --> 01:59:07.850
in some kind
of faux modernization

01:59:07.933 --> 01:59:08.934
of the catechism?

01:59:12.188 --> 01:59:13.606
Hello, Victoria.

01:59:14.357 --> 01:59:15.358
You look well.

01:59:16.567 --> 01:59:18.611
Do you refer to me, sir?

01:59:18.694 --> 01:59:21.364
A man doesn't normallY
introduce himself to his wife.

01:59:21.447 --> 01:59:22.990
But if I must...

01:59:24.408 --> 01:59:26.369
He is the God of it.

01:59:26.452 --> 01:59:29.080
I do not know if he's
in her power or she in his.

01:59:29.163 --> 01:59:31.374
'Tis Devil's work at hand.
Look!

01:59:31.457 --> 01:59:34.418
He coughs not air
as a normal man but blood.

01:59:34.502 --> 01:59:36.253
He has cancer,
you fucking idiot.

01:59:37.046 --> 01:59:38.047
Oh.

01:59:38.130 --> 01:59:39.131
Duncan.

01:59:39.215 --> 01:59:41.300
Do not lay
your eyes on me, demon!

01:59:43.511 --> 01:59:46.889
As I was saying,
General Alfred Blessington.

01:59:47.723 --> 01:59:49.308
"Alfie" to you.

01:59:49.392 --> 01:59:50.976
You really do not know me?

01:59:52.269 --> 01:59:54.522
When Mr. Wedderburn
put your photo in the paper...

01:59:54.605 --> 01:59:56.899
I remembered
that old bird in the hotel

01:59:56.982 --> 01:59:59.110
called you
Victoria Blessington,

01:59:59.193 --> 02:00:03.447
and I pieced this diabolical
fuckfest of a puzzle together.

02:00:05.449 --> 02:00:07.243
- You are...
- Your dear Alfie.

02:00:07.952 --> 02:00:11.497
You left in a state of some
mental addlement and hysteria

02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:12.581
over your pregnancy.

02:00:13.833 --> 02:00:15.060
On the discovery
of your absence,

02:00:15.084 --> 02:00:16.711
I felt disemboweled.

02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:20.005
I have disemboweled men
on the field of battle,

02:00:20.089 --> 02:00:24.385
and I always imagined a dull,
hollow throbbing,

02:00:24.927 --> 02:00:26.971
and that is what it was like.

02:00:27.596 --> 02:00:28.806
There's also a stench,

02:00:28.889 --> 02:00:32.476
but that does not apply
as a metaphor here.

02:00:33.894 --> 02:00:35.688
But here you are, my darling.

02:00:36.605 --> 02:00:37.606
Here You are.

02:00:38.190 --> 02:00:39.191
God.

02:00:39.275 --> 02:00:41.068
I have no recollection of you.

02:00:41.944 --> 02:00:43.487
I am Bella Baxter.

02:00:43.946 --> 02:00:45.030
Hurtful.

02:00:45.448 --> 02:00:46.991
But perhaps
you've hit your head,

02:00:47.074 --> 02:00:49.368
and these men have clearly
taken advantage of you.

02:00:49.452 --> 02:00:51.203
Please go, sir.

02:00:52.955 --> 02:00:55.416
- You were my husband?
- Your dear Alfie.

02:00:55.499 --> 02:00:57.626
Bella, I'm sorry.

02:01:03.799 --> 02:01:05.426
Actually, I would like to go.

02:01:06.051 --> 02:01:07.887
- What?
- Bella?

02:01:11.766 --> 02:01:13.267
You have a carriage, sir?

02:01:14.435 --> 02:01:15.478
Yes.

02:01:15.561 --> 02:01:16.645
Let us go then.

02:01:16.729 --> 02:01:17.772
Bella!

02:01:17.855 --> 02:01:19.064
Let me go, God.

02:01:19.857 --> 02:01:21.317
Max, You will not stop me.

02:01:30.576 --> 02:01:32.578
It is good to have you back,
Victoria.

02:01:49.094 --> 02:01:50.822
The servants and I
have not been getting along.

02:01:50.846 --> 02:01:52.389
I fear an uprising.

02:02:02.483 --> 02:02:03.984
You remember David, darling?

02:02:06.195 --> 02:02:08.405
Allison, look who's back.

02:02:15.079 --> 02:02:16.288
You know me?

02:02:18.123 --> 02:02:19.500
Tell me about myself.

02:02:21.961 --> 02:02:23.087
Was I nice?

02:03:00.416 --> 02:03:01.417
Eat.

02:03:02.835 --> 02:03:04.003
All Your favorites.

02:03:04.086 --> 02:03:06.130
Kippers, goose,

02:03:06.922 --> 02:03:09.425
tongue, champagne.

02:03:10.259 --> 02:03:11.260
I've missed you.

02:03:13.345 --> 02:03:15.347
What was the root
of the unhappiness?

02:03:17.141 --> 02:03:19.310
What drove her
to leap off the bridge?

02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:23.898
You hated the baby.

02:03:23.981 --> 02:03:25.608
You called it "the monster."

02:03:26.859 --> 02:03:27.943
I see.

02:03:29.612 --> 02:03:31.864
I have noticed
a lack of maternal instinct.

02:03:33.574 --> 02:03:35.409
And Yet I'm happY
to have you home.

02:03:38.078 --> 02:03:39.163
How did we meet?

02:03:39.872 --> 02:03:41.373
At a ball.

02:03:41.457 --> 02:03:42.958
Why did we like
each other?

02:03:44.543 --> 02:03:46.378
We shared a love
of good times.

02:03:48.130 --> 02:03:49.131
Watch.

02:03:50.591 --> 02:03:52.551
Allison, soup!

02:04:02.478 --> 02:04:03.562
Rex!

02:04:09.026 --> 02:04:11.070
- Fuck!
- Allison,

02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:13.447
we'll have some cheese
when you can.

02:04:19.995 --> 02:04:21.956
- A love of cruelty?
- Mm.

02:04:23.707 --> 02:04:26.126
I was not a kind person,
it seems.

02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:29.380
Kind? You would never
be so dull, Victoria.

02:04:29.463 --> 02:04:30.714
Appalling idea.

02:04:31.924 --> 02:04:33.425
Wedderburn says
you were a whore.

02:04:33.509 --> 02:04:35.386
- I suspect that was part...
- I was.

02:04:35.469 --> 02:04:36.762
In Paris.

02:04:36.845 --> 02:04:39.223
I tired of it,
but it was fascinating.

02:04:40.599 --> 02:04:41.600
Right.

02:04:41.684 --> 02:04:43.185
These kippers
are strangely delicious.

02:04:43.978 --> 02:04:45.771
Vinegary or something.

02:04:52.778 --> 02:04:54.863
Marriage
is a constant challenge.

02:04:55.489 --> 02:04:57.992
Some, we bend to,
some we bend to us.

02:04:59.868 --> 02:05:02.746
I will try to
forgive you for the whoring.

02:05:03.497 --> 02:05:06.583
Your sexual hysteria
was often out of hand.

02:05:07.334 --> 02:05:09.211
And for the killing
of our unborn child.

02:05:10.295 --> 02:05:12.715
In fact, when I list the ways
you've wronged me,

02:05:12.798 --> 02:05:14.341
Jesus Christ himself

02:05:14.425 --> 02:05:16.885
would probably
beat your head in with a bat.

02:05:20.472 --> 02:05:22.516
You're blessed
with a forgiving husband.

02:05:24.351 --> 02:05:26.186
I've not wronged you, Alfie,

02:05:26.770 --> 02:05:28.230
as I do not know you.

02:05:28.313 --> 02:05:30.083
Well, you're in luck as
I've had a lot of experience

02:05:30.107 --> 02:05:32.317
in the field with amnesia.

02:05:32.401 --> 02:05:35.195
Either men who wish to forget
where they were,

02:05:35.279 --> 02:05:37.281
or a mortar exploded nearby,

02:05:37.364 --> 02:05:39.408
ringing their cranium
like a church bell.

02:05:40.409 --> 02:05:43.287
I suggest we stick close to
the house for several months,

02:05:43.370 --> 02:05:44.580
maybe a year.

02:05:47.416 --> 02:05:49.084
Until you've made
a full recovery.

02:05:51.712 --> 02:05:52.772
I will leave at mY leisure,

02:05:52.796 --> 02:05:55.215
but I am flattered
by your desire to trap me.

02:05:57.468 --> 02:05:58.635
You're not the first.

02:06:00.721 --> 02:06:02.931
I will have to shoot you
in the fucking head

02:06:03.557 --> 02:06:05.392
if you try to leave, darling.

02:06:05.476 --> 02:06:07.186
The front or the back
of the head?

02:06:07.561 --> 02:06:08.812
The back.

02:06:08.896 --> 02:06:10.355
As to be sure you were leaving

02:06:10.439 --> 02:06:12.191
and I was not being rash.

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:19.281
I have missed You.

02:06:23.243 --> 02:06:24.995
So, I'm a prisoner?

02:06:25.079 --> 02:06:27.247
This conversation
has gone down

02:06:27.331 --> 02:06:28.749
an unfortunate route.

02:06:29.792 --> 02:06:32.503
I am sure you will be as happY
as you were before.

02:06:33.879 --> 02:06:36.381
As I was before when
I threw myself from a bridge?

02:06:42.763 --> 02:06:45.432
I suspect you fell
while looking for fish.

02:06:47.184 --> 02:06:48.411
Why would you want
to keep me here

02:06:48.435 --> 02:06:49.812
if I do not wish to stay?

02:06:50.479 --> 02:06:52.397
If one must drown,

02:06:52.481 --> 02:06:54.775
let it be
in the river of love.

02:07:01.115 --> 02:07:02.533
Mm.

02:07:04.493 --> 02:07:05.494
David,

02:07:06.912 --> 02:07:09.039
does that pheasant
look stripped to the bone?

02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:11.375
It was a misjudgment, sir.

02:07:11.834 --> 02:07:12.835
I apologize.

02:07:21.885 --> 02:07:23.762
Dessert, darling?

02:08:22.112 --> 02:08:23.697
It comes off easy?

02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:25.282
Like a button on a suit.

02:08:26.658 --> 02:08:28.911
I saw them do it in Africa
with sharpened rocks,

02:08:28.994 --> 02:08:32.789
but had mY own
more precise device made.

02:08:34.583 --> 02:08:35.918
Do you want just clitoral hood

02:08:36.001 --> 02:08:37.711
or glans as well?

02:08:37.794 --> 02:08:39.671
The whole
infernal packet.

02:08:39.755 --> 02:08:41.757
It will calm her no end.

02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:43.467
This time we will get it done.

02:08:44.134 --> 02:08:45.135
I shall get her sedated

02:08:45.219 --> 02:08:46.899
and bring her
to Your surgery this evening.

02:08:57.314 --> 02:08:59.608
Victoria, darling!

02:09:01.026 --> 02:09:02.194
Where are you?

02:09:06.531 --> 02:09:07.532
Oh.

02:09:07.616 --> 02:09:08.992
Perfect timing.

02:09:09.076 --> 02:09:10.118
Martini.

02:09:10.202 --> 02:09:11.411
Rather not.

02:09:11.995 --> 02:09:13.872
I would, however,
like to leave.

02:09:14.373 --> 02:09:16.375
I have found
our time together interesting,

02:09:16.458 --> 02:09:19.127
but I've ascertained
why I jumped from a bridge.

02:09:19.962 --> 02:09:22.506
I wish to go see
my near dead God.

02:09:23.131 --> 02:09:24.174
Adorable idea.

02:09:24.258 --> 02:09:25.842
Unfortunately, mY darling,

02:09:25.926 --> 02:09:28.887
my life is dedicated
to the taking of territory.

02:09:28.971 --> 02:09:29.972
You are mine,

02:09:30.055 --> 02:09:32.266
and that is the long
and short of it.

02:09:33.016 --> 02:09:34.434
I am not territory.

02:09:34.518 --> 02:09:38.272
The root of the problem
is between your legs.

02:09:38.355 --> 02:09:39.523
I will have it off

02:09:39.606 --> 02:09:42.526
and it will not distract
and divert you anymore.

02:09:42.609 --> 02:09:43.819
You see, a man spends his life

02:09:43.902 --> 02:09:45.779
wrangling
his sexual compulsions.

02:09:45.862 --> 02:09:49.074
It's a curse and yet,
in some ways, his life's work.

02:09:49.157 --> 02:09:51.201
A woman's life's work
is children.

02:09:51.285 --> 02:09:52.286
I intend to rid you

02:09:52.369 --> 02:09:54.454
of that infernal packet
between your legs

02:09:54.538 --> 02:09:56.748
and plant a seed in you
straight after.

02:09:57.207 --> 02:09:59.293
Let me explain
what has happened.

02:09:59.376 --> 02:10:01.003
Victoria, your wife,

02:10:01.086 --> 02:10:03.297
threw herself
from a bridge and died.

02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:06.508
Godwin Baxter found her,
brought her to his surgery.

02:10:06.591 --> 02:10:08.051
He then removed the baby,

02:10:08.135 --> 02:10:09.803
removed the brain
from the baby,

02:10:09.886 --> 02:10:12.806
transplanted it into mY head
and reanimated me.

02:10:12.889 --> 02:10:13.950
- Ah.
- I'll bring you the file.

02:10:13.974 --> 02:10:15.809
It's actually
quite fascinating.

02:10:15.892 --> 02:10:17.769
However,
I will keep my new life

02:10:17.853 --> 02:10:20.314
and my lovely old clitoris,
thank You.

02:10:20.397 --> 02:10:21.982
If You'd call
a carriage for me.

02:10:22.858 --> 02:10:24.609
They talk and talk,
and yet at some point,

02:10:24.693 --> 02:10:26.361
there's nothing left
but to pull a gun.

02:10:27.738 --> 02:10:29.614
'Tis the way with women.

02:10:42.419 --> 02:10:43.420
Are you giving in?

02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:47.674
I'd rather you shot me
in the fucking heart.

02:10:47.758 --> 02:10:50.052
I will oblige if I have to.

02:10:51.678 --> 02:10:53.263
Drink the drink, darling.

02:10:54.056 --> 02:10:55.057
Chloroform and gin.

02:11:04.941 --> 02:11:06.526
In some ways,
it would be a relief

02:11:06.610 --> 02:11:08.695
to be rid of my questing self.

02:11:09.237 --> 02:11:11.656
Sip deeply
and that freedom is yours.

02:11:24.461 --> 02:11:25.462
Fuck.

02:11:40.227 --> 02:11:41.228
Max?

02:11:44.439 --> 02:11:47.526
Max. We have
to get him to surgery.

02:11:48.402 --> 02:11:49.653
He'll die if we don't.

02:11:49.736 --> 02:11:50.904
Bleeding a lot.

02:11:50.987 --> 02:11:53.115
You're fucking dead.

02:11:54.241 --> 02:11:55.909
Uh, Bella, if he lives,

02:11:55.992 --> 02:11:59.413
I do not sense
he is a man who will stop.

02:11:59.955 --> 02:12:01.665
Well, I won't watch him
bleed to death.

02:12:02.207 --> 02:12:04.209
But I agree,
he could do with improvement.

02:12:17.305 --> 02:12:19.266
I've removed the bullet
and stopped the bleeding.

02:12:19.891 --> 02:12:21.226
I have the notes.

02:12:29.317 --> 02:12:31.736
I am never happier
than when I'm in here.

02:13:04.561 --> 02:13:05.979
Bella.

02:13:06.062 --> 02:13:07.355
You're back.

02:13:13.278 --> 02:13:15.739
It was just a story
of someone else,

02:13:16.948 --> 02:13:18.450
not Bella Baxter.

02:13:26.416 --> 02:13:29.377
All my life,
people's eyes looked at me,

02:13:29.461 --> 02:13:31.505
horror, pity...

02:13:33.215 --> 02:13:34.382
but you.

02:13:41.932 --> 02:13:44.017
It's all very interesting...

02:13:46.061 --> 02:13:47.687
what is happening.

02:14:44.411 --> 02:14:45.537
<i>Merci.</i>

02:14:47.622 --> 02:14:49.541
Anatomy exam
is making me nervous.

02:14:49.624 --> 02:14:52.127
I've tested You many times.
You know it.

02:14:53.545 --> 02:14:55.547
No one knows anatomy
better than you.

02:15:00.176 --> 02:15:01.261
Ladies, gin?

02:15:02.137 --> 02:15:03.138
Please.

02:15:03.722 --> 02:15:04.723
Gin?

02:15:07.392 --> 02:15:09.769
We should get some water
for the general.

02:15:16.026 --> 02:15:17.027
Felicity,

02:15:18.028 --> 02:15:19.029
water.
